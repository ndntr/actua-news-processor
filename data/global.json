Anthropic's campaign seemingly touched a nerve at OpenAI just weeks after the ChatGPT maker began testing ads in a lower-cost tier of its chatbot. Altman called Anthropic's ads \"clearly dishonest,\" accused the company of being \"authoritarian,\" and said it \"serves an expensive product to rich people,\" while Rouch wrote, \"Real betrayal isn't ads. It's control.\" Anthropic's four commercials, part of a campaign called \"A Time and a Place,\" each open with a single word splashed across the screen: \"Betrayal,\" \"Violation,\" \"Deception,\" and \"Treachery.\" They depict scenarios where a person asks a human stand-in for an AI chatbot for personal advice, only to get blindsided by a product pitch.Read full article Comments",

Instead of a place primarily inhabited by humans, the web may very soon be dominated by autonomous AI bots. A new report measuring bot activity on the web, as well as related data shared with WIRED by the Internet infrastructure company Akamai, shows that AI bots already account for a meaningful share of web traffic. The findings also shed light on an increasingly sophisticated arms race unfolding as bots deploy clever tactics to bypass website defenses meant to keep them out. “The majority of the Internet is going to be bot traffic in the future,” says Toshit Pangrahi, cofounder and CEO of TollBit, a company that tracks web-scraping activity and published the new report. “It’s not just a copyright problem, there is a new visitor emerging on the Internet.”Read full article Comments",
