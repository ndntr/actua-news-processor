Writing in The Conversation, medical microbiologist Manal Mohammed from the University of Westminster has explained that colds and flu are caused by viruses that spread either by respiratory droplets or person to person regardless of the temperature. However, there is a bit of truth in the idea – many viruses survive for longer in colder and dryer conditions, increasing the chances of them hanging around and infecting a fresh victim. Cold weather also encourages us to spend more time indoors, and in crowded and poorly ventilated spaces viruses can build up and jump from person to person more easily. Reduced sunlight in winter also lowers production of Vitamin D, which can lead to a weakened immune system. Continue reading...",
