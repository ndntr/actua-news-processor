I dispute this interpretation as the study was clearly not designed to allow for the stress-reducing differential between the environments in which participants viewed original artworks or copies of them.Elimination of this factor would have required study of heart rate, skin temperature and saliva in two further groups: one viewing original artworks in a non-gallery environment and the second viewing copies of the same paintings at the Courtauld Gallery.
