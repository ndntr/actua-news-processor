While World Cancer Research Fund (a British charity) supports a ban, Cancer Research UK has stuck to issuing warnings.But with skin cancer rates rising, and evidence that the existing ban on children using sunbeds is being flouted, it is unsurprising that cancer doctors think more should be done. The ban on children using commercial sunbeds in the UK was introduced in 2010. Since then, Australia has banned such businesses altogether.
