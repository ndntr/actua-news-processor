          "content": "So far this year, electricity use in the US is up nearly 4 percent compared to the same period the year prior. That comes after decades of essentially flat use, a change that has been associated with a rapid expansion of data centers. And a lot of those data centers are being built to serve the boom in AI usage. Given that some of this rising demand is being met by increased coal use (as of May, coal's share of generation is up about 20 percent compared to the year prior), the environmental impact of AI is looking pretty bad. But it's difficult to know for certain without access to the sorts of details that you'd only get by running a data center, such as how often the hardware is in use, and how often it's serving AI queries. So, while academics can test the power needs of individual AI models, it's hard to extrapolate that to real-world use cases. By contrast, Google has all sorts of data available from real-world use cases. As such, its release of a new analysis of AI's environmental impact is a rare opportunity to peer a tiny bit under the hood. But the new analysis suggests that energy estimates are currently a moving target, as the company says its data shows the energy drain of a search has dropped by a factor of 33 in just the past year.Read full article Comments",

But it was a statement he started to question almost immediately, given there were clinical cases in psychiatry where patients reported deriving absolutely no pleasure from listening to any kind of tunes. So, Pallarés and his team spent the past 10 years researching the neural mechanisms behind a condition they called specific musical anhedonia: the inability to enjoy music. The wiring behind joy When we like something, it is usually a joint effect of circuits in our brain responsible for perception—be it perception of taste, touch, or sound—and reward circuits that give us a shot of dopamine in response to nice things we experience. For a long time, scientists attributed a lack of pleasure from things most people find enjoyable to malfunctions in one or more of those circuits.Read full article Comments",

The Republican-led FTC's determined to keep pressure on the nonprofit—which is dedicated to monitoring conservative misinformation—ever since Elon Musk villainized MMFA in 2023 for reporting that ads were appearing next to pro-Nazi posts on X. Musk claims that reporting caused so many brands to halt advertising that X's revenue dropped by $1.5 billion, but advertisers have suggested there technically was no boycott. They've said that many factors influenced each of their independent decisions to leave X—including their concerns about Musk's own antisemitic post, which drew rebuke from the White House in 2023. In the time since, the toxic content has started coming from within X, via backlash-inducing outputs from its chatbot Grok. For MMFA, advertisers, agencies, and critics, a big question remains: Can the FTC actually penalize advertisers for invoking their own rights to free expression and association by refusing to deal with a private company just because they happened to agree on a collective set of brand standards to avoid monetizing hate speech or offensive content online?Read full article Comments",

This endangers various marine species, and monitoring those changes is vitally important. But it can be challenging to reach the deepest waters without the aid of very expensive equipment. Moon jellyfish can swim to those depths, however, making them a potential ally in the quest to study the deep ocean. That's why researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU Boulder) have built \"cyborg\" jellyfish equipped with tiny microelectronics devices, with the aim of gathering critical data on temperature, acidity, and other relevant properties. To further improve their hybrid creations, the team has been studying the biomechanics of how jellyfish swim. Their research also involves analyzing water flow patterns generated by swimming jellies using suspended starchy biodegradable particles, described in the group's most recent paper published in the journal Physical Review Fluids. Creating biohybrid creatures is a well-established field. For instance, as we previously reported, scientists have been intrigued by the potential of cyborg insects since the 1990s, when researchers began implanting tiny electrodes into cockroach antennae and shocking them to direct their movements. The idea was to use them as hybrid robots for search-and-rescue applications.Read full article Comments",

ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, New Jersey—Micro LED is still years away, but the next best thing is taking shape right now. A $30,000 price tag and 114.5-inch diagonal size makes the Samsung \"Micro RGB\" TV that I demoed this week unattainable for most. But the unique RGB backlight and Micro LED-sized diodes it employs represent a groundbreaking middle ground between high-end Mini LED and true Micro LED, expanding the possibilities for future premium displays beyond the acronyms we know today. Micro RGB isn’t the same as Micro LED To be clear, Samsung's Micro RGB TV is not a Micro LED display. During Samsung's presentation, a representative described the TV as sitting \"squarely in between\" Mini LED and Micro LED. Unlike true Micro LED TVs, Samsung's Micro RGB TV uses a backlight. The backlight is unique in that it can produce red, green, and/or blue light via tiny RGB LEDs. Most LCD-LED backlights create just blue or white backlighting, which is applied to color filters to create the different hues displayed on the screen.Read full article Comments",

These terminations were challenged in court, and a consolidated case was heard in the District of Massachusetts, pitting the government against individual researchers, organizations that represent them, and states that host research institutions. The result was a decisive win for the scientists. As the ruling explained, the government's termination efforts violated a statute against \"arbitrary and capricious\" policies, resulting in a stay that both blocked implementation of the policy and restored the flow of research funding. That stay remained intact through appeals that brought it to the Supreme Court, which released its ruling on Thursday. As the result is a complicated split among the Justices, the stay against the policy itself remains intact. However, a slim majority decided that government funding issues are required to be heard by a different court and cannot be issued as part of the same ruling. So, researchers who lost their funding due to the now-defunct policy will remain de-funded.Read full article Comments",

The current administration has made no secret of its hostility toward EVs and, as promised, has ended as many of the existing EV subsidies and vehicle pollution regulations as it could. After more than a year of month-on-month growth, EV sales started to contract, and brands like Genesis and Volvo have seen their customers reject their electric offerings, forcing portfolio rethinks. But wait, it gets worse. Time and again, surveys and studies show that fears and concerns about charging are the main barriers standing in the way of someone switching from gas to EV. A new market research study by Telemetry Vice President Sam Abuelsamid confirms this, as it analyzes the charging infrastructure needs over the next decade. And one of the biggest hurdles—one that has gone mostly unmentioned across the decade-plus we've been covering this topic—is all the junk clogging up Americans' garages. Want an EV? Clean out your garage That's because, while DC fast-charging garners all the headlines and much of the funding, the overwhelming majority of EV charging is AC charging, usually at home—80 percent of it, in fact. People who own and live in a single family home are overrepresented among EV owners, and data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory from a few years ago found that 42 percent of homeowners park near an electrical outlet capable of level 2 (240 V) AC charging.Read full article Comments",

The sterile IV solutions produced in the plant are essential supplies for hospitals and other medical facilities, which use them in various treatments, from rehydration to drug delivery and kidney dialysis. And the plant damaged by Helene—Baxter International's North Cove manufacturing facility in Marion—didn't just make some of the US supply; it made 60 percent. With the Baxter plant down, hospitals around the country began rationing supplies. They changed treatment strategies and, in some cases, canceled or delayed surgeries. In one poll, over 86 percent of health care providers said they were affected by the nationwide shortage. The federal government, for its part, loosened importation rules and granted extensions to expiration dates to offer some relief from the dire shortage. This secondary emergency was yet another reminder of just how fragile the US drug supply chain has become. Just months before the catastrophic hurricane in North Carolina, drug shortages in the US reached an all-time high, with 323 active and ongoing shortages. Although they've fallen since then, they remain high, with shortages in the first quarter of this year at 253, according to data collected by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.Read full article Comments",

Other systems are better thought of as convenience features—things like adaptive cruise control and lane keeping, which relieve some of the burden of driving. Among the newer of these is the traffic jam assist. It's a variant of adaptive cruise plus lane keeping designed for low-speed stop-start driving on limited-access highways, usually cutting out around 40 mph. But we're still talking about a so-called \"level 2\" system, where the human driver is responsible for maintaining situational awareness; even more advanced \"level 3\" assists exist—these allow the driver to completely disengage from the task—but are not the topic for today. AAA recently put five (unnamed) ADAS systems to the test in the Los Angeles area, blessed as it is with dependable heavy freeway traffic. The testers went out together in morning and afternoon weekday traffic, covering the same routes simultaneously. The vehicles were driven an average of 342 miles (550 km) over 16.2 hours, with the ADAS operated according to each vehicle's user manual.

Driving down the pocked and barren two-lane road to its sandy terminus, I found only rolling dunes, a large mound of dirt, and a few satellite dishes that talked to Dragon spacecraft as they flew overhead. A few years later, in mid-2019, the company had moved some of that dirt and built a small launch pad. A handful of SpaceX engineers working there at the time shared some office space nearby in a tech hub building, \"Stargate.\" The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley proudly opened this state-of-the-art technology center just weeks earlier. That summer, from Stargate's second floor, engineers looked on as the Starhopper prototype made its first two flights a couple of miles away. Over the ensuing years, as the company began assembling its Starship rockets on site, SpaceX first erected small tents, then much larger tents, and then towering high bays in which the vehicles were stacked. Starbase grew and evolved to meet the company's needs.Read full article Comments",

Monterey Car Week is an annual celebration of automotive culture at the extremes: extreme performance, extreme rarity, and extreme value. Cars offering more than 1,000 hp (746 kW) are de rigueur, \"unique\" models are everywhere you look, and machines costing well into seven figures are entry-level. A few years ago, many of the new cars debuting during Car Week focused on outright speed and performance above all else, relying on electric powertrains to deliver physics-defying acceleration and ballistic speed. Lately, there's been a shift back toward the fundamentals of driver engagement, emotional design, and purity of feel. Internal combustion is again at the fore. One of the main reasons is a renewed interest in what was old—so long as that old thing is actually new.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "A local Neolithic community in northeastern France may have clashed with foreign invaders, cutting off limbs as war trophies and otherwise brutalizing their prisoners of war, according to a new paper published in the journal Science Advances. The findings challenge conventional interpretations of prehistoric violence as bring indiscriminate or committed for pragmatic reasons. Neolithic Europe was no stranger to collective violence of many forms, such as the odd execution and massacres of small communities, as well as armed conflicts. For instance, we recently reported on an analysis of human remains from 11 individuals recovered from El Mirador Cave in Spain, showing evidence of cannibalism—likely the result of a violent episode between competing Late Neolithic herding communities about 5,700 years ago. Microscopy analysis revealed telltale slice marks, scrape marks, and chop marks, as well as evidence of cremation, peeling, fractures, and human tooth marks. This indicates the victims were skinned, the flesh removed, the bodies disarticulated, and then cooked and eaten. Isotope analysis indicated the individuals were local and were probably eaten over the course of just a few days. There have been similar Neolithic massacres in Germany and Spain, but the El Mirador remains provide evidence of a rare systematic consumption of victims.Read full article Comments",

Instead of directing the lion's share of money to Elon Musk's space and satellite company, early results indicate that states still plan to deploy fiber broadband networks to most of their unserved households. When the Trump administration announced its overhaul of the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program in March, estimates published by The Wall Street Journal suggested that SpaceX could receive $10 billion to $20 billion under the new rules. Musk clearly expected a big windfall; as we've written, SpaceX alleges that Virginia and Louisiana violated the Trump administration's rules by allocating most of the money to fiber providers instead of Starlink's satellite service. Assuming Virginia and Louisiana don't back down, SpaceX has indicated it will ask the Trump administration to reject their grant proposals. SpaceX might end up filing similar objections in many other states after more of them reveal their plans. A third state, West Virginia, revealed its plan on Tuesday, and SpaceX isn't likely to be happy with it.Read full article Comments",

Those workers in particular were shocked when CBA announced last month that their jobs had become redundant. At that time, CBA claimed that launching the chatbot supposedly \"led to a reduction in call volumes\" by 2,000 a week, FSU said.Read full article Comments",
