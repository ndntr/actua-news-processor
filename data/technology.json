          "content": "Windows 8 is remembered most for its oddball touchscreen-focused full-screen Start menu, but it also introduced a number of under-the-hood enhancements to Windows. One of those was UEFI Secure Boot, a mechanism for verifying PC bootloaders to ensure that unverified software can't be loaded at startup. Secure Boot was enabled but technically optional for Windows 8 and Windows 10, but it became a formal system requirement for installing Windows starting with Windows 11 in 2021. Secure Boot has relied on the same security certificates to verify bootloaders since 2011, during the development cycle for Windows 8. But those original certificates are set to expire in June and October of this year, something Microsoft is highlighting in a post today. This certificate expiration date isn't news—Microsoft and most major PC makers have been talking about it for months or years, and behind-the-scenes work to get the Windows ecosystem ready has been happening for some time. And renewing security certificates is a routine occurrence that most users only notice when something goes wrong.Read full article Comments",

          "standfirst": "Numerous major social platforms including Meta, YouTube, TikTok and Snap say they will submit to a new external grading process that scores social platforms on how well they protect adolescent mental health. The program comes from the Mental Health Coalition’s Safe Online Standards (SOS) initiative, which comprises about two dozen standards covering areas like platform policy, functionality, governance and transparency, content oversight and more. The SOS initiative is led by Dr. Dan Reidenberg, Managing Director of the National Council for Suicide Prevention. In announcing these companies' participation, the Mental Health Coalition writes \"SOS establishes clear, user-informed data for how social media, gaming, and digital platforms design products, protect users ages 13–19, and address exposure to suicide and self-harm content. Participating companies will voluntarily submit documentation on their policies, tools, and product features, which will be evaluated by an independent panel of global experts.\" After evaluation, the platforms will be given one of three ratings. The highest achievable safety rating is \"use carefully,\" which comes with a blue badge that compliant platforms can display. Despite being the highest rating, the requirements seem fairly run-of-the-mill. The description includes things like \"reporting tools are accessible and easy to use,\" and \"privacy, default and safety functions are clear and easy to set for parents.\" As for what actions the standards ask of the companies being rated, the \"use carefully\" rating says \"platforms and filters help reduce exposure to harmful or inappropriate content.\" The other ratings include \"partial protection\" which is described in part as \"some safety tools exist on the platforms, but can be hard to find or use,\" and \"does not meet standards\" which would be given if \"filters and content moderation do not reliably block harmful or unsafe content.\" The Mental Health Coalition, founded in 2020, has mentioned Facebook and Meta as partners since the early days of the organization. In 2021 the organization said it would bring together \"leading mental health experts partner with Facebook and Instagram to destigmatize mental health and connect people to resources\" during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022 the nonprofit published a case study with \"support from Meta\" that found \"mental health content on social media can reduce stigma while increasing individuals’ likelihood to seek resources, therefore positively impacting mental health.\" In 2024, the MHC \"in partnership with Meta\" launched a campaign called the Time Well Spent Challenge. In it, the group urged parents to have “meaningful conversations” with teens about “healthy” social media use, focusing less on whether teens should be on these apps at all and more on keeping them on-platform in a “time well spent” way, from reduced screen time to “using social media for good” and reviewing their feeds together. That same year it partnered with Meta again to establish \"Thrive,\" a program that allows tech companies to share data regarding materials that violate self-harm or suicide content guidelines. The Mental Health Coalition lists Meta as a \"creative partner\" on its website. Last year it was alleged that Meta buried internal data showing the ill effects of its products on users' mental health. The internal research, dubbed \"Project Mercury,\" began in 2020.

          "content": "Numerous major social platforms including Meta, YouTube, TikTok and Snap say they will submit to a new external grading process that scores social platforms on how well they protect adolescent mental health. The program comes from the Mental Health Coalition’s Safe Online Standards (SOS) initiative, which comprises about two dozen standards covering areas like platform policy, functionality, governance and transparency, content oversight and more. The SOS initiative is led by Dr. Dan Reidenberg, Managing Director of the National Council for Suicide Prevention. In announcing these companies' participation, the Mental Health Coalition writes \"SOS establishes clear, user-informed data for how social media, gaming, and digital platforms design products, protect users ages 13–19, and address exposure to suicide and self-harm content. Participating companies will voluntarily submit documentation on their policies, tools, and product features, which will be evaluated by an independent panel of global experts.\" After evaluation, the platforms will be given one of three ratings. The highest achievable safety rating is \"use carefully,\" which comes with a blue badge that compliant platforms can display. Despite being the highest rating, the requirements seem fairly run-of-the-mill. The description includes things like \"reporting tools are accessible and easy to use,\" and \"privacy, default and safety functions are clear and easy to set for parents.\" As for what actions the standards ask of the companies being rated, the \"use carefully\" rating says \"platforms and filters help reduce exposure to harmful or inappropriate content.\" The other ratings include \"partial protection\" which is described in part as \"some safety tools exist on the platforms, but can be hard to find or use,\" and \"does not meet standards\" which would be given if \"filters and content moderation do not reliably block harmful or unsafe content.\" The Mental Health Coalition, founded in 2020, has mentioned Facebook and Meta as partners since the early days of the organization. In 2021 the organization said it would bring together \"leading mental health experts partner with Facebook and Instagram to destigmatize mental health and connect people to resources\" during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022 the nonprofit published a case study with \"support from Meta\" that found \"mental health content on social media can reduce stigma while increasing individuals’ likelihood to seek resources, therefore positively impacting mental health.\" In 2024, the MHC \"in partnership with Meta\" launched a campaign called the Time Well Spent Challenge. In it, the group urged parents to have “meaningful conversations” with teens about “healthy” social media use, focusing less on whether teens should be on these apps at all and more on keeping them on-platform in a “time well spent” way, from reduced screen time to “using social media for good” and reviewing their feeds together. That same year it partnered with Meta again to establish \"Thrive,\" a program that allows tech companies to share data regarding materials that violate self-harm or suicide content guidelines. The Mental Health Coalition lists Meta as a \"creative partner\" on its website. Last year it was alleged that Meta buried internal data showing the ill effects of its products on users' mental health. The internal research, dubbed \"Project Mercury,\" began in 2020. Since then the company has introduced some bare-minimum attempts at addressing mental health concerns, such as Instagram teen accounts. Meta is now on trial in California facing allegations over child harm from addictive products, the first in a series of upcoming lawsuits against the social media giant. Other companies participating in the rating program include Roblox, which has recently faced stiff accusations over the wellbeing of children on the platform, and Discord which has beefed up its age-verification processes in response to its own serious child endangerment concerns.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-tiktok-and-snap-are-participating-in-an-online-safety-ratings-system-162921333.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "If you're an iPhone user who likes to keep tabs on where your stuff is, you can't go far wrong with an AirTag. The second-gen model that Apple just released outpaces the original in every way (aside from the galling lack of a keyring hole, that is). While it's easy enough to replace the battery in both versions of the AirTag, you might not want to have to worry about the device's battery life for a very long time. Enter Elevation Lab's extended battery case for the AirTag, which is currently on sale at Amazon for $16. The case usually sells for $23, so that's a 30 percent discount. It's not the first time we've seen this deal, but it's a pretty decent one all the same. This is arguably one of the more useful AirTag accessories around for certain use cases. It won't exactly be helpful for an AirTag that you put in a wallet or attach to your keys, as it's too bulky for such a purpose — and it doesn't have a hole for a keyring anyway. Still, if you're looking for an AirTag case that you can place in a suitcase or backpack and not have to touch for years, this could be the ticket. Elevation Lab says that, when you place a couple of AA batteries in the case, it can extend the tracker's battery life to as much as 10 years (the brand recommends using Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries for best results). The AirTag is slated to run for over a year on its standard CR2032 button cell. The case gives the AirTag more protection as well. It's sealed with four screws and it has a IP69 waterproof rating. What's more, it doesn't ostensibly look like an AirTag case, so someone who steals an item with one inside is perhaps less likely to realize that the object they pilfered is being tracked. There are some other downsides, though. Since the AirTag is locked inside a case, the sound it emits will be muffled. Elevation Lab says the device's volume will be about two-thirds the level of a case-free AirTag. However, the second-gen AirTag is louder than its predecessor, which should mitigate that issue somewhat.

Notebooks like these provide the kind of screen space you'd typically only get from a dual monitor setup, but in a much more compact form factor that you can easily take on the road. It could be that people were wary of an unfamiliar design, shorter battery life or buying a first-gen product — all of which are understandable concerns. However, now that ASUS has given the ZenBook Duo a total redesign for 2026, the company has addressed practically all of those barriers to entry while making it an even more convincing machine for anyone who could use more display space. Which, in my experience, is pretty much everyone. Editor’s note: The 2026 ASUS Zenbook Duo is expected to be available for pre-order sometime in late February, with general availability slated for March. Design For the new model, ASUS didn't mess with the laptop's basic layout too much. Instead, the company polished and tightened everything up, resulting in a system that weighs about the same (3.6 pounds) while reducing its overall size (12.1 x 8.2 x 0.77 to 0.92 inches) by five percent. Critically, you still get a built-in kickstand on the bottom and a detachable keyboard that you move wherever you want. There’s also a decent number of ports, including two USB-C with Thunderbolt 4, one USB-A 3.2 jack, HDMI 2.1 and a combo audio port. That said, I do wish ASUS had found room for an SD card reader of some kind, though given the Zenbook Duo's unique design, I get why that didn't make it. The Zenbook Duo's detachable keyboard gives users a ton of flexibility when it comes to utilizing both of the laptop's displays. Sam Rutherford for Engadget One of the Zenbook Duo's most important design upgrades is a new \"hideaway\" hinge that reduces the gap between the laptop's two screens. Not only does this make the laptop easier and more pleasant to use in dual-screen mode, it also allows the entire system to lay flat on a table, which is nice for drawing or sharing your screen with someone sitting opposite you. Unfortunately, while my review unit didn’t come with one, ASUS says its forthcoming Pen 3.0 will come bundled with the Zenbook Duo in the US, so you won’t need to pay extra for it. Another small but appreciated improvement is the new pogo pins below the lower display, which provides a more secure and reliable way of keeping the laptop's detachable keyboard topped up. In my experience, even after running multiple rundown tests that completely drained the Duo's battery, I never had to charge up the keyboard on its own. It was always smart enough to sip electricity from the main system in the background, though it also has a built-in USB-C port for power just in case. On the flipside, if you're not scared of typing on glass, you can still use the lower screen as a keyboard and touchpad, or as a place to display widgets for news, the weather, performance and more. Displays As someone who loves a desktop with dual monitors, I can't overstate how nice it is to have similar built-in functionality on a laptop. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The standout feature on the Zenbook Duo continues to be its dual displays, and now for 2026, they look better than ever. Both OLED panels have a 144Hz refresh rate with a 2,880 x 1,800 resolution while also covering 100 percent of the DCI-P3 spectrum. And while its nominal brightness of 500 nits for SDR content is just OK, ASUS makes up for that with peaks of up to 1,000 nits in HDR. And to make both screens even more enjoyable, ASUS managed to shrink the size of their bezels down to just 8.28mm. That's a reduction of 70 percent compared to the previous model, so now there's even less getting in the way of you utilizing these screens to their fullest. Performance The Zenbook Duo can be configured with a range of new Intel Core Ultra 7 and Core Ultra 9 processors, including the X9 388H chip used on our review unit. For general use and productivity, the laptop is super smooth and responsive, though that shouldn't be a surprise coming from Intel's latest top-of-the-line mobile CPU. However, for those seeking max performance, some of the benchmark numbers aren't quite as impressive as you might expect. That’s because ASUS has limited the Duo's TDP (thermal design power) to 45 watts — which is shy of the chip's 80-watt turbo power limit. The kickstand in back adds a bit a bulk, but it's better than not having one at all like with Lenovo's Yoga Book. Sam Rutherford for Engadget In PCMark 10, the Zenbook Duo only managed a score of 7,153 compared to 9,651 from a Dell XPS 14, despite the latter having a lower-tier Intel Core Ultra X7 358H processor. That said, in other tests like Geekbench 6, the Duo had no trouble staying on top with a multicore score of 17,095 versus 9,651 for the Dell. Another pleasant surprise is that because the Duo's chip comes with Intel's upgraded Arc B390 integrated GPU, this thing has plenty of oomph to game on, let alone edit videos or other similar tasks. In Elden Ring at 1,920 x 1,200, the Zenbook maintained a relatively stable framerate between 55 and 60 fps on high settings, which is great considering this thing doesn't have discrete graphics. This means as long as you don't mind fiddling with game options a bit, you should be able to play newer AAA games without too much trouble. Battery life The left side of the Zenbook Duo features a full-size HDMI connector along with a USB-C port, plus a backup USB-C jack for charging the detachable keyboard. Sam Rutherford for Engadget You'd think a laptop with two displays would be super power hungry. However, by increasing the capacity of its cell from 75WHrs to 99WHrs, ASUS has made the Zenbook Duo's endurance (or lack thereof) a complete non-issue. On PCMark 10's Modern Office rundown test, the laptop lasted 18 hours and 33 minutes in single-screen mode. Granted, that's nearly four hours less than what we got from MSI's Prestige 14 Flip AI+, but considering that's the longest-lasting notebook we've ever tested, I'm not bothered. When compared to ASUS' own Zenbook A14 (18:16), things are basically a wash, which I think is a win for the Duo, as the A14 is meant to be an ultralight system with an emphasis on portability and longevity. Obviously, battery life takes a hit when you're using both displays. However, when I re-ran our battery test with its two displays turned on, the Duo still impressed with a time of 14:23. This is more than enough to give you the confidence to set this thing up in dual-screen mode even when an outlet isn't close at hand. Thankfully, for times when you do need a power adapter, the charging brick on ASUS' cable is rather compact, so it's not a chore to lug it around. Wrap-up The Zenbook Duo's battery life is good enough you won't always need its power brick. Thankfully, when you do, ASUS' 100-watt adapter is relatively compact. Sam Rutherford for Engadget I'm a believer that one day people will eventually embrace typing on screens with laptops just like they have for smartphones. However, even if you're not willing to make that jump just yet, the Zenbook Duo still has all of its bases covered. Its detachable keyboard gives you a pleasant experience while freeing up the bottom of the notebook to be a second display. This allows you to have something similar to a traditional dual-monitor desktop but in a chassis that you can easily take on the road without any major compromises. The 2026 Zenbook Duo combines a compact design with strong performance, plenty of ports and surprisingly good battery life. Sure, it's a touch heavier than a typical 14-inch laptop, but its two screens more than make up for a little added weight and thickness. That leaves price as the Duo's remaining drawback, and starting at $2,100 (or $2,300 as reviewed), it certainly isn't cheap. However, when you consider that a similarly equipped rival like a Dell XPS 14 costs just $50 less for a single screen, that price difference is rather negligible. Alternatively, if you opt for a more affordable ultraportable and then tack on a decent third-party portable monitor, you're still likely looking at a package that costs between $1,500 and $1,800. Plus, that setup is significantly bulkier and more annoying to carry around. So while the Zenbook Duo might be an unconventional pick right now, it has all the tools to deliver unmatched portable productivity and I don’t think it will be too much longer until the masses catch on.

          "standfirst": "The peak time for deals on streaming services — the holiday shopping season — has come and gone, but Disney is back with a fresh offer for the new year. New and eligible returning subscribers can get one month of the ad-supported Disney+ Hulu bundle for just $10. That's $3 off the usual monthly rate for the bundle, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the prices for each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month). We'd be remiss if we didn't mention that this isn't quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so. Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases. Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like The Bear, The Handmaid’s Tale and Only Murders in the Building, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV. The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.

          "standfirst": "Last year the UK declared that Apple and Google were a duopoly with \"strategic market status\" in the mobile platforms market, making them subject to special regulations. However, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will not regulate Google and Apple's app stores like the EU has done. Rather, government plans to enforce its own digital markets rules in a \"pragmatic\" way by accepting \"commitments\" from Apple and Google in areas like app rankings, the CMA announced. Google and Apple agreed to work with the CMA to address concerns on the following matters: app review, app ranking, use of data and interoperability process. Effectively, regulators require the tech giants to treat developers fairly, particularly when they compete against Google and Apple's own apps. However, the UK's rules are more like suggestions and \"not legally binding in any case,\" former CMA director Tom Smith told the Financial Times. This is in stark contrast to Europe's Digital Markets Act, which forced Apple to make changes to open up iOS features and data to rivals, allow app installations from outside its Store and reduce fees collected on purchases. That could change if the companies fail to comply with its measures, though. The CMA plans to check metrics like the number of apps approved or rejected, app review times and developer complaints received. New requirements could then be brought forward if deemed necessary. \"For example, if we find Apple is routinely declining interoperability requests without good reason... we could bring forward specific interoperability requirements. Non-compliance would also mean we would be unlikely to consider commitments as a similar approach in [the] future.\" Google said in a blog today that it \"welcomed the opportunity to resolve the CMA's concerns collaboratively.\" Apple, meanwhile, seemed similarly pleased with the deal. \"The commitments announced today allow Apple to continue advancing important privacy and security innovations for users and great opportunities for developers,” an Apple spokesperson told Bloomberg. The UK is possibly taking a light touch on app store rules to avoid antagonizing the Trump administration. Earlier today, French President Emmanuel Macron predicted that the US could go after the EU on areas like data privacy, digital taxation and the plan of multiple EU countries to ban children from social media. \"The US will, in the coming months — that’s certain — attack us over digital regulation,\" Macron said at a special summit yesterday.

          "standfirst": "I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper, so E Ink tablets have been intriguing to me ever since they started becoming more widely available. After having hundreds of half-filled notebooks over the years, I, at some point, turned to digital tools instead because it was just easier to store everything on my phone or laptop so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in recent years — now you can find them in multiple sizes, some have color E Ink screens and others double as full-blow ereaders with access to ebook stores and your local library’s offerings. I’ve tested out close to a dozen E Ink tablets over the past few years to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today. Best E Ink tablets for 2026 Are E Ink tablets worth it? An E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall. The final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad. Arguably the biggest reason why you wouldn’t want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations. What to look for in an E Ink tablet Writing and latency Arguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately. Reading How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading). The supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the Kindle or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet. Also with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to bring those titles over to a third-party device. Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others. Search functionality Most E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more. Searching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text. Sharing and connectivity While we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere. None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet after the tablet portion is done. Price E Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like. E Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to \"increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: \"We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We've communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.” As a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that's for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn't great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It's also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well. Other E Ink tablets we've tested Onyx Boox Tab X C The Boox Tab X C is a color-screened version of the Tab X, the company’s all-purpose e-paper Android tablet. The Tab X C has a lovely 13.3-inch Kaleido 3 E Ink color display, an octa-core processor, 6GB of RAM and it runs on Android 13, making it one of the most powerful tablets in Boox’s lineup. I’ve used the Tab X in the past and this color version runs similarly, if not better, and at 5.3mm thick, it’s impressively svelte even when you pair it with its folio keyboard case. As someone who loves legal-pad sized things to write on, I also like how the Tab X C is most akin to A4-size paper. But at $820 for the bundle with the standard case (or a whopping $970 for the tablet and its keyboard case), it’s really only best for those who are ready to go all-in on a premium E Ink tablet. Lenovo Smart Paper Lenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the Smart Paper, but it's too pricey and too married to the company's companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn't as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo's cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive. Onyx Boox Tab Ultra The Boox Tab Ultra has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Is agentic AI ready to reshape Global Business Services?",
          "standfirst": "Presented by EdgeVerveBefore addressing Global Business Services (GBS), let’s take a step back. Can agentic AI, the type of AI able to take goal-driven action, transform not just GBS but any kind of enterprise? And has it done so yet? As with many new technologies, rhetoric has outpaced deployment in this case. While 2025 was “supposed to be the year of agentic AI,” it didn’t turn out that way, according to VentureBeat Contributing Editor Taryn Plumb. Leaning on input from Google Cloud and integrated development environment (IDE) company Replit, Plumb reported in a December 2025 VentureBeat post that what has been missing are the fundamentals required to scale.Given the experience of Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative (gen)AI, this outcome is not surprising. In a survey conducted at the February 2025 Shared Services & Outsourcing Network (SSON) summit, 65% of GBS organizations responded that they had yet to complete a GenAI project. One can safely say that the adoption of the more recently arrived agentic AI is still in its very nascent stages for enterprises, including GBS.The role of agentic AI in Global Business ServicesThere are good reasons, nonetheless, to focus on the tremendous potential of agentic AI and its application to the GBS sector. Stripped of hype, Agentic AI unlocks capabilities in the orchestration layer of software workflows that weren’t practical before. It does so through a range of techniques, including (but not requiring) LLMs. While enterprises may indeed be missing certain fundamentals needed to deploy agentic AI at scale, those prerequisites are not out of reach. As for GBS and Global Capability Centers (GCCs), they have already been undergoing a makeover, from back-office extensions into increasingly strategic enterprise partners. Agentic AI is a natural fit because one of its standard use cases involves IT operations or customer-service agents, functionality already within the existing GBS and GCC wheelhouse. So yes, agentic AI could potentially transform the GBS sector. Industry leaders can best move toward scaled deployment by taking a methodical approach.Five steps for deploying agentic AI in GBSAgentic AI is not the only game in town. As noted, there’s GenAI, used primarily for content creation. But broadening the scope, we can also point to predictive AI and document AI, used respectively for forecasting and data extraction. (Neither requires LLMs.) Exposure to preexisting AI bodes well for the future of agentic AI.First, these flavors of AI are mutually supportive, stacked (rather than siloed) in modern systems. Agentic AI, in particular, is positioned to draw upon the others. Second, having lived through the hype cycle of GenAI, industry leaders may be inclined to take a more measured – and productive – approach to agentic AI. Rather than rushing into a pilot, the industry would do well to prep carefully (steps 1-3). When combined with the right test project (step 4), these actions can pave the way for a scaled-up deployment of agentic AI (step 5): Know thy processes. Business operations can be complicated. Consider a top global shipping and logistics firm, whose thousands of full-time employees at its seven GBS centers supported more than 80 processes involving highly complex, manually intensive workflows with wide regional variations. Only by first understanding existing processes and workflows does an organization like this stand a chance of being able to rethink or rework them. Know thy data. Closely related are the data that workflows depend upon. How do these data flow from end to end? What do the pipelines look like? Where are the key APIs? Are the data structured or unstructured? Do the resources include data platforms (systems of record) and vector databases (context engines), both of which AI agents need to make good decisions? What kind of data governance and security prevail? How might those change in an agentic AI scenario? Identify the problem. In the case of the shipping firm mentioned above, the complexity and variation of the workflows, as well as their manual intensity, exposed it to significant costs, lapses in service level agreements (SLAs), poor customer experience and heightened compliance and legal risks. Once named, a problem logically becomes a potential use case with discrete objectives. Pilot an operating model. Options include consolidating efforts in a Center of Excellence (COE), democratizing development through citizen-led approaches, and partnering through Build-Operate-Transform-Transform-Transfer (BOTT) models, among others. Without structural clarity, even promising AI pilots are difficult to extend beyond their initial domain. The model should also reflect reality. Likely involving multiple, parallel agents in pursuit of coordinated goals, Agentic AI is still constrained by environment, complexity, risks and governance.Scale up. Successful pilots lead to their own next steps. Take the fragmented experience of a large multinational bank in Australia. After automating several non-core processes through Automation COE, the bank realized it needed to analyze and improve its most complex workflows. It selected an over-the-top software platform that enabled it to complete more than 100 discovery projects in under 14 months. Pilots thus may grow, becoming enterprise-wide initiatives.What agentic AI looks like at enterprise scale Only scale can yield real impact. The shipping provider, with its seven GBS centers, ended up with technology capable of building data pipelines, digitizing complex documents, applying rule-based reasoning across country-specific exceptions and orchestrating work across teams. That foundation led to an AI-first transformation of about 16 initiatives, exponential growth in automation and significant efficiency gains. By unleashing capabilities at the orchestration layer – enabling contextual perception, cross-domain collaboration, and autonomous action aligned with governance – agentic AI can turbo-charge operations, both AI and human. Consider a procurement process. While document AI can extract data from purchase orders, obviating certain manual checks, an AI agent could also evaluate vendor risk, cross-reference compliance standards, verify budget availability and even initiate negotiation while keeping audit logs for regulatory reporting. In a financial advisory scenario, while predictive AI can analyze trends, an AI agent could take further action, assisting professionals in particular business units on targeted strategic investments.Note that the agent isn’t replacing human judgment, but extending it, ensuring decisions are made faster, more consistently and on a scale.From standalone automation to agentic ecosystems in GBSGBS is uniquely positioned to lead the enterprise into the agentic AI era. By design, GBS sits at the intersection of processes and data across multiple business units. Finance, HR, supply chain and IT all flow through the shared services model. This central vantage point makes GBS an ideal launchpad for creating agentic AI ecosystems.An ecosystem differs from standalone automation. Agents don’t perform tasks in isolation. Rather, they work as part of an interconnected system. They share insights, learn from one another and coordinate to optimize outcomes at the enterprise level. Deployed within a GBS or GCC, Agentic AI can accelerate their ongoing transformation, enabling them to leapfrog incremental automation and operate at the level of end-to-end process orchestration.N.

Leaning on input from Google Cloud and integrated development environment (IDE) company Replit, Plumb reported in a December 2025 VentureBeat post that what has been missing are the fundamentals required to scale.Given the experience of Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative (gen)AI, this outcome is not surprising. In a survey conducted at the February 2025 Shared Services & Outsourcing Network (SSON) summit, 65% of GBS organizations responded that they had yet to complete a GenAI project. One can safely say that the adoption of the more recently arrived agentic AI is still in its very nascent stages for enterprises, including GBS.The role of agentic AI in Global Business ServicesThere are good reasons, nonetheless, to focus on the tremendous potential of agentic AI and its application to the GBS sector. Stripped of hype, Agentic AI unlocks capabilities in the orchestration layer of software workflows that weren’t practical before. It does so through a range of techniques, including (but not requiring) LLMs. While enterprises may indeed be missing certain fundamentals needed to deploy agentic AI at scale, those prerequisites are not out of reach. As for GBS and Global Capability Centers (GCCs), they have already been undergoing a makeover, from back-office extensions into increasingly strategic enterprise partners. Agentic AI is a natural fit because one of its standard use cases involves IT operations or customer-service agents, functionality already within the existing GBS and GCC wheelhouse. So yes, agentic AI could potentially transform the GBS sector. Industry leaders can best move toward scaled deployment by taking a methodical approach.Five steps for deploying agentic AI in GBSAgentic AI is not the only game in town. As noted, there’s GenAI, used primarily for content creation. But broadening the scope, we can also point to predictive AI and document AI, used respectively for forecasting and data extraction. (Neither requires LLMs.) Exposure to preexisting AI bodes well for the future of agentic AI.First, these flavors of AI are mutually supportive, stacked (rather than siloed) in modern systems. Agentic AI, in particular, is positioned to draw upon the others. Second, having lived through the hype cycle of GenAI, industry leaders may be inclined to take a more measured – and productive – approach to agentic AI. Rather than rushing into a pilot, the industry would do well to prep carefully (steps 1-3). When combined with the right test project (step 4), these actions can pave the way for a scaled-up deployment of agentic AI (step 5): Know thy processes. Business operations can be complicated. Consider a top global shipping and logistics firm, whose thousands of full-time employees at its seven GBS centers supported more than 80 processes involving highly complex, manually intensive workflows with wide regional variations. Only by first understanding existing processes and workflows does an organization like this stand a chance of being able to rethink or rework them. Know thy data. Closely related are the data that workflows depend upon. How do these data flow from end to end? What do the pipelines look like? Where are the key APIs? Are the data structured or unstructured? Do the resources include data platforms (systems of record) and vector databases (context engines), both of which AI agents need to make good decisions? What kind of data governance and security prevail? How might those change in an agentic AI scenario? Identify the problem. In the case of the shipping firm mentioned above, the complexity and variation of the workflows, as well as their manual intensity, exposed it to significant costs, lapses in service level agreements (SLAs), poor customer experience and heightened compliance and legal risks. Once named, a problem logically becomes a potential use case with discrete objectives. Pilot an operating model. Options include consolidating efforts in a Center of Excellence (COE), democratizing development through citizen-led approaches, and partnering through Build-Operate-Transform-Transform-Transfer (BOTT) models, among others. Without structural clarity, even promising AI pilots are difficult to extend beyond their initial domain. The model should also reflect reality. Likely involving multiple, parallel agents in pursuit of coordinated goals, Agentic AI is still constrained by environment, complexity, risks and governance.Scale up. Successful pilots lead to their own next steps. Take the fragmented experience of a large multinational bank in Australia. After automating several non-core processes through Automation COE, the bank realized it needed to analyze and improve its most complex workflows. It selected an over-the-top software platform that enabled it to complete more than 100 discovery projects in under 14 months. Pilots thus may grow, becoming enterprise-wide initiatives.What agentic AI looks like at enterprise scale Only scale can yield real impact. The shipping provider, with its seven GBS centers, ended up with technology capable of building data pipelines, digitizing complex documents, applying rule-based reasoning across country-specific exceptions and orchestrating work across teams. That foundation led to an AI-first transformation of about 16 initiatives, exponential growth in automation and significant efficiency gains. By unleashing capabilities at the orchestration layer – enabling contextual perception, cross-domain collaboration, and autonomous action aligned with governance – agentic AI can turbo-charge operations, both AI and human. Consider a procurement process. While document AI can extract data from purchase orders, obviating certain manual checks, an AI agent could also evaluate vendor risk, cross-reference compliance standards, verify budget availability and even initiate negotiation while keeping audit logs for regulatory reporting. In a financial advisory scenario, while predictive AI can analyze trends, an AI agent could take further action, assisting professionals in particular business units on targeted strategic investments.Note that the agent isn’t replacing human judgment, but extending it, ensuring decisions are made faster, more consistently and on a scale.From standalone automation to agentic ecosystems in GBSGBS is uniquely positioned to lead the enterprise into the agentic AI era. By design, GBS sits at the intersection of processes and data across multiple business units. Finance, HR, supply chain and IT all flow through the shared services model. This central vantage point makes GBS an ideal launchpad for creating agentic AI ecosystems.An ecosystem differs from standalone automation. Agents don’t perform tasks in isolation. Rather, they work as part of an interconnected system. They share insights, learn from one another and coordinate to optimize outcomes at the enterprise level. Deployed within a GBS or GCC, Agentic AI can accelerate their ongoing transformation, enabling them to leapfrog incremental automation and operate at the level of end-to-end process orchestration.N.

          "standfirst": "In a major milestone for the \"AI coding wars,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman confirmed on X that the company&#x27;s standalone Codex application (currently only for Mac computers) surpassed 1 million downloads in its first week of availability, echoing the explosive growth of OpenAI&#x27;s hit chatbot ChatGPT after it first launched in late 2022.The surge reflects a 60% week-over-week growth in overall Codex users, following the February 2 launch of the app and the subsequent release of the underlying GPT-5.3-Codex model.While OpenAI is currently celebrating this rapid adoption, the company is signaling that the era of unlimited free access to its most powerful agentic tools is transitioning toward a more restricted model.The agentic coding command centerUnlike traditional auto-complete plugins, the Codex app is positioned as a \"command center\" for agentic coding. It utilizes GPT-5.3-Codex, a model OpenAI describes as its most capable agentic model to date. Notably, Altman claimed that the model was instrumental in its own creation, with early versions used to debug the very training runs that produced the final release.The app&#x27;s primary innovation is its ability to orchestrate multiple AI agents simultaneously. According to OpenAI&#x27;s release notes, the app allows users to:Run Parallel Worktrees: Deploy independent agents to explore different code paths simultaneously without branch conflicts.Delegate Long-Running Tasks: Offload routine maintenance, such as dependency updates and test runs, to background automations.Supervise Coordinated Teams: Move between agents in a unified desktop interface while maintaining full context of a complex project.Limits coming to low-cost and free usersThe 1 million download milestone was catalyzed by OpenAI’s decision to offer Codex access to ChatGPT Free and \"Go\" tier users for a limited promotional period. However, Altman has warned that this high-compute \"free lunch\" is not permanent.\"We’ll keep Codex available to Free/Go users after this promotion; we may have to reduce limits there but we want everyone to be able to try Codex and start building,\" Altman shared on X.This shift aligns with OpenAI&#x27;s broader strategy to manage the immense costs of its \"High capability\" models and applications.While paid OpenAI ChatGPT subscribers (Plus, Pro, Team, and Enterprise) currently enjoy doubled rate limits, the $8/month \"Go\" tier and Free tiers are likely to see stricter throttling as the promotion ends.The AI coding wars are in full swingOpenAI’s push comes as competitors gain significant ground. Anthropic’s Claude Code recently reported reaching $1 billion in annualized revenue within six months of launch.Simultaneously, the \"vibe coding\" movement has seen the rise of model-agnostic tools like Kilo CLI 1.0. Backed by GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij, Kilo unveiled a rebuilt interface on February 4 that supports over 500 models, including rivals like Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen and Google Gemini. Kilo&#x27;s strategy of \"Agentic Anywhere\"—shipping code via terminal, Slack, or IDE—contrasts with the ecosystem-locked nature of OpenAI&#x27;s Codex app.For enterprise decision-makers, especially AI engineers and orchestrators, the rapid-fire releases of GPT-5.3-Codex and Kilo CLI 1.0 signal a transition from AI as a \"copilot\" to AI as an \"operator.\" What 1 million downloads means for enterprise decision-makersThe milestone of 1 million downloads for the Codex app is not merely a figure of consumer interest; it is a validation of the demand for agentic systems that can autonomously manage debugging, deployment, and cross-platform orchestration. To move forward confidently, leaders must shift their focus from single-shot prompts to the management of agentic workflows, ensuring these tools are integrated into governed repositories and that their \"self-improving\" cycles are subjected to rigorous human-in-the-loop oversight.To ensure business success in this evolving landscape, decision-makers should adopt a platform-agnostic and governance-first strategy.While the raw power of GPT-5.3-Codex is undeniable—demonstrated by its record 77.3% result on the Terminal-Bench 2.0 benchmark measuring agentic performance in the terminal environment, according to OpenAI —the rise of open-source, model-flexible alternatives like Kilo CLI suggests that maintaining optionality is critical to avoiding vendor lock-in and opaque subscription costs. Leaders must prioritize building a \"governed agent layer\" that standardizes identity, permissions, and audit logs across all tools, whether they are proprietary ecosystems or open-core terminal interfaces. By treating these agents as a digital workforce to be orchestrated rather than just a set of tools to be used, enterprises can safely scale their development velocity without sacrificing architectural integrity or security.",

          "standfirst": "NordVPN is having a big sale on its two-year plans right now. The Complete tier, for example is 70 percent off, bringing the price of 24 months down to just $130. NordVPN regularly appears on Engadget’s list of the best VPN services thanks to its wide server network, strong security tools and consistent performance across devices. NordVPN’s latest promotion puts one of its most comprehensive plans at a price that undercuts many competing premium VPN subscriptions. The Complete tier includes full access to NordVPN’s core VPN service, which encrypts internet traffic and masks a user’s IP address to help protect online activity on public Wi-Fi networks and at home. Subscribers can use the service on multiple devices, including phones, tablets, laptops and smart TVs, with apps available for major operating systems. It also includes access to NordPass (more on that below), an ad blocker and 1TB of cloud storage. You’ll find similar discounts on all of NordVPN’s other plans: Basic, Plus and Prime. Beyond the basics, NordVPN offers features like threat protection to help block malicious websites and trackers, as well as specialty servers designed for added privacy or faster performance in specific scenarios. In our NordVPN review, the service was praised for its evolving feature set and overall reliability, even as the VPN market becomes increasingly competitive. Engadget regularly tracks VPN pricing trends and this offer compares favorably with other current promotions. It also appears alongside NordVPN deals featured in Engadget’s ongoing roundup of the best VPN discounts available right now, which compares offers from multiple major providers. Those looking for additional security tools may also want to note that NordVPN’s Complete plan bundles in extra services beyond the VPN itself. One of those is NordPass, the company’s password management app. NordPass is also discounted as part of a separate promotion, if you’re primarily looking for a password manager rather than a VPN. The Premium tier is currently 50 percent off, bringing the price down to $36 for two years. NordPass Premium adds features such as cross-device password syncing, secure password sharing and breach monitoring, which alerts users if stored credentials appear in known data leaks.

          "content": "NordVPN is having a big sale on its two-year plans right now. The Complete tier, for example is 70 percent off, bringing the price of 24 months down to just $130. NordVPN regularly appears on Engadget’s list of the best VPN services thanks to its wide server network, strong security tools and consistent performance across devices. NordVPN’s latest promotion puts one of its most comprehensive plans at a price that undercuts many competing premium VPN subscriptions. The Complete tier includes full access to NordVPN’s core VPN service, which encrypts internet traffic and masks a user’s IP address to help protect online activity on public Wi-Fi networks and at home. Subscribers can use the service on multiple devices, including phones, tablets, laptops and smart TVs, with apps available for major operating systems. It also includes access to NordPass (more on that below), an ad blocker and 1TB of cloud storage. You’ll find similar discounts on all of NordVPN’s other plans: Basic, Plus and Prime. Beyond the basics, NordVPN offers features like threat protection to help block malicious websites and trackers, as well as specialty servers designed for added privacy or faster performance in specific scenarios. In our NordVPN review, the service was praised for its evolving feature set and overall reliability, even as the VPN market becomes increasingly competitive. Engadget regularly tracks VPN pricing trends and this offer compares favorably with other current promotions. It also appears alongside NordVPN deals featured in Engadget’s ongoing roundup of the best VPN discounts available right now, which compares offers from multiple major providers. Those looking for additional security tools may also want to note that NordVPN’s Complete plan bundles in extra services beyond the VPN itself. One of those is NordPass, the company’s password management app. NordPass is also discounted as part of a separate promotion, if you’re primarily looking for a password manager rather than a VPN. The Premium tier is currently 50 percent off, bringing the price down to $36 for two years. NordPass Premium adds features such as cross-device password syncing, secure password sharing and breach monitoring, which alerts users if stored credentials appear in known data leaks. Both offers are available for a limited time, though Nord has not specified an end date for the promotion. If you’re still unsure whether NordVPN is right for you, it offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can change your mind and get a full refund.

          "standfirst": "Fraud protection is a race against scale. For instance, Mastercard’s network processes roughly 160 billion transactions a year, and experiences surges of 70,000 transactions a second during peak periods (like the December holiday rush). Finding the fraudulent purchases among those — without chasing false alarms — is an incredible task, which is why fraudsters have been able to game the system. But now, sophisticated AI models can probe down to individual transactions, pinpointing the ones that seem suspicious — in milliseconds’ time. This is the heart of Mastercard’s flagship fraud platform, Decision Intelligence Pro (DI Pro). “DI Pro is specifically looking at each transaction and the risk associated with it,” Johan Gerber, Mastercard’s EVP of security solutions, said in a recent VB Beyond the Pilot podcast. “The fundamental problem we&#x27;re trying to solve here is assessing in real time.”How DI Pro worksMastercard’s DI Pro was built for latency and speed. From the moment a consumer taps a card or clicks “buy,” that transaction flows through Mastercard’s orchestration layer, back onto the network, and then on to the issuing bank. Typically, this occurs in less than 300 milliseconds. Ultimately, the bank makes the approve-or-decline decision, but the quality of that decision depends on Mastercard’s ability to deliver a precise, contextualized risk score based on whether the transaction could be fraudulent. Complicating this whole process is the fact that they’re not looking for anomalies, per se; they’re looking for transactions that, by design, are similar to consumer behavior. At the core of DI Pro is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that Mastercard refers to as an \"inverse recommender\" architecture. This treats fraud detection as a recommendation problem; the RNN performs a pattern completion exercise to identify how merchants relate to one another. As Gerber explained: “Here&#x27;s where they&#x27;ve been before, here&#x27;s where they are right now. Does this make sense for them? Would we have recommended this merchant to them?” Chris Merz, SVP of data science at MasterCard, explained that the fraud problem can be broken down into two sub components: A user’s pattern behavior and a fraudster’s pattern behavior. “And we&#x27;re trying to tease those two things out,” he said. Another “neat technique,” he said, is how Mastercard approaches data sovereignty, or when data is subject to the laws and governance structures in the region where it is collected, processed, or stored. To keep data “on soil,” the company’s fraud team relies on aggregated, “completely anonymized” data that is not sensitive to any privacy concerns and thus can be shared with models globally. “So you still can have the global patterns influencing every local decision,” said Gerber. “We take a year&#x27;s worth of knowledge and squeeze it into a single transaction in 50 milliseconds to say yes or no, this is good or this is bad.”Scamming the scammersWhile AI is helping financial companies like Mastercard, it’s helping fraudsters, too; now, they’re able to rapidly develop new techniques and identify new avenues to exploit. Mastercard is fighting back by engaging cyber criminals on their turf. One way they’re doing so is by using \"honeypots,\" or artificial environments meant to essentially \"trap\" cyber criminals. When threat actors think they’ve got a legitimate mark, AI agents engage with them in the hopes of accessing mule accounts used to funnel money. That becomes “extremely powerful,” Gerber said, because defenders can apply graph techniques to determine how and where mule accounts are connected to legitimate accounts. Because in the end, to get their payout, scammers need a legitimate account somewhere, linked to mule accounts, even if it’s cloaked 10 layers down. When defenders can identify these, they can map global fraud networks.“It’s a wonderful thing when we take the fight to them, because they cause us enough pain as it is,” Gerber said.

          "title": "The best microSD cards in 2026",
          "standfirst": "Most microSD cards are fast enough for boosting storage space and making simple file transfers, but some provide a little more value than others. If you’ve got a device that still accepts microSD cards — whether it’s an older gaming handheld, the new Nintendo Switch 2, a dash cam, a drone or an Android tablet — we’ve scoured the market and put close to 20 top contenders through a number of benchmark tests. You can find our recommendations for the best microSD cards below, alongside some general shopping advice worth knowing before you buy. Best microSD cards of 2026 Best microSD Express cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 Jeff Dunn for Engadget Read our full guide to the best microSD Express cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 Let’s be clear about this: Unless you plan to own a Nintendo Switch 2 in the near future, you do not need a high-speed microSD Express card just yet. Nintendo’s gaming handheld is the only popular device that natively supports this standard right now, and microSD Express cards themselves are highly expensive compared to more traditional options. Still, if you do want to increase a Switch 2’s storage, they’re your only choice. Fortunately, determining exactly which model to buy for the console is pretty straightforward: Get whichever one you can find in stock, in the capacity you want, at a price you can stomach. We benchmarked several microSD Express cards for a separate Switch 2 guide, and for the most part, the performance differences between them weren’t great enough to justify paying extra for any particular model. Loading times weren’t quite identical with every test we ran, but the cards were extremely close in most games and common scenarios. The few times when there was a notable gap — fast-traveling to a particularly resource-heavy region in Cyberpunk 2077, for instance — the gulf between the slowest and fastest card was only ever about four or five seconds at most. That’s not nothing, but it’s also not something most people are likely to fret over unless they have a stopwatch handy. The SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro. Jeff Dunn for Engadget The only time you’d notice a major speed difference is if you transfer games to your Express card from the Switch 2’s internal storage (and vice versa). In that case, the SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro were generally the quickest, while PNY’s microSD Express Flash Memory Card had particularly slow write speeds. Moving Mario Kart World to the SanDisk and Lexar models, for example, took around four minutes and 35 seconds on average; with the PNY card, it took a little over seven minutes. That said, the PNY model was the fastest when it came to moving games back to the system storage. Walmart’s Onn microSD Express Card was significantly slower to move games from the card to system storage, but it’s also the most affordable card we’ve seen by a good distance. Either way, most people aren’t constantly shuffling their games back and forth like this. Performance in actual games is more important, and in that regard the results were consistently much tighter. What matters most is getting the most space for your budget. Unfortunately, stock for all microSD Express cards has been spotty since the Switch 2’s launch. For your convenience, we’ll list out all of the models we’ve tested thus far and their respective list prices below. Note that some lower-capacity versions — the 128GB SanDisk card, for one — advertise slower speeds than their more spacious counterparts. SanDisk microSD Express Card: 128GB ($64), 256GB ($78), 512GB ($128) Lexar Play Pro: 256GB ($60), 512GB ($120), 1TB ($220) PNY microSD Express Flash Memory Card: 128GB ($48), 256GB ($62), 512GB ($124) Samsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2: 256GB ($60) Samsung P9 Express: 256GB ($55), 512GB ($100) GameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2: 256GB ($60), 512GB ($100), 1TB ($190) Walmart Onn microSDXC Express Card: 256GB ($47), 512GB ($85) The Lexar Play Pro on top of Lexar's RW540 microSD Express card reader. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Broadly speaking, we recommend getting at least 256GB of storage, as Switch 2 games tend to have much larger file sizes than games for Nintendo’s previous handheld. But we also recommend holding off upgrading for as long as you can, if only because all of these cards should (tariff shenanigans aside) come down in price as time goes on. There’s no point in buying a microSD Express card for anything besides the Switch 2, but we did run the models above through our usual PC benchmarks as well. Unsurprisingly, they are miles faster than any traditional card on the market. With the 256GB SanDisk card, for instance, sequential read speeds checked in just under 900 MB/s in CrystalDiskMark and ATTO, while sequential writes topped out around 650 MB/s. Sustained writes speeds were slower (around 210 MB/s), but that was still fast enough to move our 12GB test file to the card in 52 seconds on average. It took a mere 20 seconds to read the file back to our PC. The write test with our smaller 1.15GB test folder, meanwhile, averaged just 4.5 seconds. It all adds up to performance that's at least twice as fast as the best UHS-I models we’ve tested in terms of sequential reads and writes, with three or four times the speeds in some cases. The gulf in random reads and writes is similar, and in some benchmarks even greater. But you need a pricey SD card reader to even see those increases on a PC, so only those with a Switch 2 in hand or serious cash to burn should consider one of these things. Other notable microSD cards Samsung Pro Ultimate The Samsung Pro Ultimate was the closest competitor to the Lexar Professional Silver Plus across our benchmark tests, but it's tangibly worse in terms of sequential write speeds, typically costs more and doesn’t offer a 1TB option. The Samsung Pro Plus is a bit slower for sequential reads, but it’s close enough otherwise and usually easier to find at a lower price. Lexar Professional Gold We haven't used it ourselves, but if you’re willing to pay for a more powerful UHS-II card built for heavy-duty video recording, the Lexar Professional Gold has tested well elsewhere and should deliver significantly faster sequential write speeds than our UHS-I picks above. It’s one of the few UHS-II cards we could actually find in stock, but it’s pricey, with a 128GB model normally priced in the $35 to $40 range. SanDisk Extreme The SanDisk Extreme effectively matched the Pro Plus in a few of our sequential tests, but that was partly due to us only being able to secure the 256GB model, which is higher-rated than the 128GB version. It’s a fine choice if you see it on sale at a reputable seller, but it’s broadly slower than our top pick and often costs more. SanDisk GamePlay The SanDisk GamePlay performs similarly to the SanDisk Extreme but costs a good bit extra as of our latest update. We couldn’t get it to reach its advertised speeds with the company’s own “Pro” card reader or other third-party options, so it fell short of our top picks. SanDisk Pokémon The SanDisk Pokémon does outperform its advertised read and write speeds, but not by enough to outpace the Lexar Silver Plus or Samsung Pro Plus. It essentially charges extra for having a picture of Pikachu (or Gengar, or Snorlax) on a product you’ll never look at. SanDisk Extreme Pro The SanDisk Extreme Pro is a close analog to the Samsung Pro Ultimate but, as of this writing, is either unavailable at most trusted retailers or priced too high by comparison. The Lexar Professional Silver Plus has faster sequential write speeds as well. PNY XLR8 Gaming The PNY XLR8 is an affordable card that comes with up to 512GB of space. Its sequential and random writes speeds checked in a little bit above those of Samsung’s Evo Select, plus it comes with a lifetime warranty. But its sequential reads were much, much slower, putting it out of contention. PNY Elite-X The PNY Elite-X often goes for cheap and wasn’t too far off the random read/write performance of Samsung's Pro Plus in CrystalDiskMark. Like the XLR8, it’s also slightly above the Evo Select in write speeds. But its sequential reads were too far behind all of our top picks, and it no longer appears to be available in capacities above 256GB. What to look for in a microSD card Capacity The first thing to figure out when buying a microSD card is how much storage space you need. Modern cards are commonly available in sizes ranging from 32GB to 512GB, with several models now available in 1TB or 1.5TB capacities as well. The first 2TB cards from major brands have started to arrive as well, which is exciting, but those are still fairly rare (and very expensive) by comparison. For many, a 128GB or 256GB model should be a sweet spot between price and storage space. But if you need more room — say, for stashing a bunch of games on a Steam Deck — a 512GB card or greater could make more sense and often provides a better cost-per-GB ratio. Pricing and stock levels are all over the place as of our most recent update thanks to ongoing AI-driven shortages, but you can typically still find a decent 128GB card for around $15, a good 256GB card for less than $30 and a solid 512GB card for around $40 (with faster models priced a little higher). There’s a starker increase when you go up to 1TB cards, which often cost closer to $100, though we’ve seen some fall into the $70 to $80 range over the last year. The first 2TB cards are a bigger leap: the 2TB SanDisk Extreme, for example, currently has a list price around $290, which is way up from what we saw in 2025. Note that a microSD card’s performance may differ depending on what capacity you buy. SanDisk says its 128GB Extreme card delivers sequential write speeds up to 90 MB/s, for example, while the higher-capacity models in the same line offer up to 130 MB/s. When we talk about microSD cards today, we mostly refer to cards that use the microSDXC (eXtended Capacity) standard, which have a capacity between 32GB and 2TB. Your device needs to support this for it to work with a microSDXC card. This will almost never be an issue these days, but some older devices (a Nintendo 3DS, for instance) are only compatible with microSDHC (High Capacity) cards, which range from 2GB to 32GB. Read and write speeds MicroSD cards are primarily judged on their read and write speeds, which are usually measured in megabytes per second (MB/s). Generally, most microSD cards have faster read speeds than write speeds. These metrics can then be broken down into sequential and random performance. Sequential read and write speeds matter when you’re trying to access (read) or save (write) long, constant streams of data, such as opening a large video or copying a big batch of files from a PC. If you want to use a microSD card for media storage, this is particularly important. Random performance, meanwhile, is about how quickly a card can read and write small files scattered throughout the device. Since random read/write speeds are much lower than sequential ones, storage device makers tend not to advertise them as loudly. But they’re important if you use a card with a gaming device or a single-board computer like the Raspberry Pi, where it often has to rapidly save and access small bits of data in random locations. Speed ratings If you look at a microSD card, you’ll see a buffet of numbers, letters and symbols. Most of these refer to the card’s speed class and performance ratings, which are determined by the SD Association. A card’s Video Speed Class, or V-rating, details its minimum sequential write speed, which is especially important when recording video from a camera. It ranges from V6 to V90. Most of the cards we tested had a V30 rating, so they have a sequential write speed of at least 30 MB/s. This should be enough to support up to 4K video at lower bitrates. Higher-rated V60 and V90 cards are usually better for capturing 8K, but they come at a much higher cost. The UHS Speed Class, or U-rating, also refers to a card’s minimum sequential write speed. It comes in two varieties: U3, which mandates a minimum of 30 MB/s, and U1, which is rated for 10 MB/s. The older Speed Class rating overlaps with the other two systems. It’s signified by a C symbol and goes from Class 2 to Class 10, with the number (again) indicating minimum sequential write speed. This rating is less relevant nowadays, but you may still see a “C10” logo on some cards. The Application Performance spec, marked by an A symbol, is an indicator of random read/write speeds. This is measured in IOPS, or input/output operations per second, rather than MB/s. There are two categories here: A1 cards offer a minimum random read speed of 1,500 IOPS and a minimum random write speed of 500 IOPS, while A2 cards bump those up to 4,000 IOPS and 2,000 IOPS, respectively. Both ratings also guarantee sequential write speeds of at least 10 MB/s. To keep it simple, most people should look for a card with V30, U3 and A2 ratings. It’s totally possible to get a solid card without those: A U1 card might be worth it if you just need a cheap, high-capacity option, for example. V60 and V90 cards are worth a look if you’re serious about shooting high-resolution photos and video as well. But overall, cards with the certifications above should provide the best blend of price and performance today. It’s important to emphasize that these ratings are baselines. Most V30 cards offer significantly higher write speeds than 30 MB/s, for instance, and some A1 cards can outperform some A2 models in practice. The speeds advertised by manufacturers aren’t always 100 percent accurate, either: Sometimes the card will be slower in real-world use, other times it may actually be a bit faster. Samsung UHS bus speeds The other spec to note is the card’s bus interface. Most microSD cards available today are UHS-I, which has a theoretical maximum speed of 104 MB/s. There are also UHS-II cards, which have an extra row of pins on the back and can reach up to 312 MB/s. (A UHS-III standard technically exists as well but hasn’t seen wide adoption.) These are labeled on the card with a Roman numeral I or II. UHS-II cards are typically the ones with those higher V60 or V90 ratings. If you shoot lots of 4K to 8K video or frequently use burst mode to capture ultra high-res photos, the performance gains of a good UHS-II card can save you time. However, these are typically much more expensive than UHS-I cards: This 128GB Lexar Professional Gold model, for instance, is a relative bargain at $35. While that's less than many UHS-II models we’ve seen in the past, it's still more than double the common street price of our top pick above. You need a device that’s compatible with the UHS-II interface to see any benefits, too, and stock for UHS-II cards is often spottier. For now, the higher speeds aren’t worth the price premium for most people, so we stuck mostly to UHS-I cards with our recommendations. Unlike traditional UHS-I cards, a microSD Express card like the SanDisk model on the right comes with a second row of pins to enable its improved performance. Jeff Dunn for Engadget microSD Express and the Nintendo Switch 2 The absolute fastest microSD cards you can buy, however, are based on a different interface called SD Express. This has technically been around for several years and now includes its own subset of speed classes, but the gist is that it's much faster than UHS-I or UHS-II: SanDisk’s recently released microSD Express card, one of the first commercially available models, advertises sequential read speeds up to 880MB/s. That’s quicker than some older SSDs. It’s a substantial upgrade that has largely held up in our testing, but very few popular devices natively support SD Express today. The first major exception is the Nintendo Switch 2, which is only compatible with the newer standard, as it’s needed to keep up with the performance demands of new handheld games. Besides SanDisk, manufacturers like Samsung, Lexar and PNY have already launched microSD Express cards to go with the console. The presumption is that having such a popular device embrace the tech will only further its adoption and drive prices down. But it’s still early days, and right now all microSD Express cards cost much more than the best UHS-I or even UHS-II options. Beyond the Switch 2, it’s possible to take advantage of these cards’ superior speeds with a dedicated SD Express card reader, but that adds even more to the final cost. It’s also worth noting that SD Express cards are not backwards compatible with UHS-II (or UHS-III), so if you try to plug one into a device with a UHS-II slot, it’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds. Still, they’re a must for Nintendo fans going forward, and the tech should have plenty of appeal if more gadgets that support the interface do arrive. For more on how the first wave of Express cards perform on the Switch 2, we've put together a dedicated buying guide just for Nintendo's console. A note on card readers and reaching advertised speeds While the UHS-I interface has a theoretical maximum of 104 MB/s, some UHS-I cards can exceed that speed through proprietary extensions. However, you need a compatible card reader and host device to take advantage of that extra performance. If you find a UHS-I card advertising speeds higher than 104 MB/s, this is what’s going on. You can see these limits in action with an original Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck: Both of those gaming devices support the UHS-I interface but don’t go beyond its official speed, flattening any sequential gains some cards may have elsewhere. (Differences in random read and write speeds can still matter, though.) The same thing will happen if you plug a more powerful UHS-II or SD Express card into a device that doesn’t accept those interfaces. The takeaway: Your microSD card will only be as fast as the slowest link in your chain. Warranty Many microSD cards are designed to be durable, with protection from water, extreme temperatures, X-rays and drops. Still, in case of catastrophe, a long warranty is always good to have. Many manufacturers offer lifetime or 10-year limited warranties, though we’ve noticed that “endurance” cards marketed to withstand more hours of writing are usually covered for a shorter period of time. For example, Samsung's Pro Endurance, a model aimed at security cameras and other monitoring devices, comes with a five-year warranty. Avoiding counterfeits The memory card market has had a particular problem with scammers selling fake products. To guard against this, only buy from a known brand and a reputable retailer such as Best Buy, B&H Photo or Adorama. If you shop at Amazon, only buy if the shipper and seller is Amazon.com. (That said, a handful of users have reported receiving counterfeits even from Amazon directly in the past, so exercise caution.) Remember: If a price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be wary of any retailer offering a significantly lower price than everyone else. Once you receive a card, check its packaging for any irregularities. You can run benchmark tests like CrystalDiskMark or BlackMagic Disk Speed Test to verify its speeds aren’t drastically lower than what’s advertised (or possible, given its specs). You can also use software that’s designed to verify the true capacity and performance of your card, such as H2testw and FakeFlashTest. A few of the microSD card readers we've used for testing. Jeff Dunn for Engadget How we test microSD cards We've put about 20 microSD cards through a series of tests to verify their sequential and random performance. These included benchmarks like CrystalDiskMark, BlackMagic Disk Speed Test, ATTO Disk Benchmark and AJA System Test, as well as a few “real-world” tests. We copied and pasted a small folder of photos about 1.15GB in size to and from each card, then did the same with a larger 12.2GB folder containing multiple file types and subfolders, timing the process each time. We also checked how each card performed on the Steam Deck, downloading games of varying sizes — including Stardew Valley, Aperture Desk Job, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Apex Legends — then timing how long it took to launch each game and load save files. We do multiple runs of each test to verify our findings and account for potential outliers. Where applicable, we used a Kingston USB 3.2 UHS-II reader to test each card on both Windows 11 and macOS Sequoia. However, if a card could be bundled with (or is specifically advertised to use) a proprietary reader, we mainly tested with that, since we figure that’s the one most interested buyers will end up using. For Windows testing, we used an Alienware gaming PC with an Intel Core i9-10900F, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. For macOS, we used a 2021 16-inch MacBook Pro with an Apple M1 Pro chip, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. If a reader couldn’t connect over USB-C, we used CalDigit’s TS4 dock to test the corresponding card on the MacBook. We tested the 128GB version of each card whenever we could, though we were only able to test higher-capacity models for a few options. We also reformatted each card before testing with the SD Association’s Memory Card Formatter tool. For microSD Express cards, we ran each model through a series of tests specific to the Switch 2, since that is the only popular device that actually supports the tech. You can read more about that process in our separate buying guide linked above. Recent updates December 2025: We’ve tested the Samsung P9 Express microSD Express card and noted it in our Switch 2 section above. We’ve also made a few edits to highlight recent price increases and stock shortages driven by the ongoing AI boom.

The Samsung Pro Plus, our previous recommendation, stays as a runner-up. We’ve also added SanDisk’s recently released microSD Express card as a pick for those who want the absolute fastest card possible, albeit with heavy caveats. This is one of the first microSD cards to use the SD Express bus interface, so we’ve included more details on what that entails in our “what to look for in a microSD card” section. Lastly, we’ve removed our write-up for SanDisk’s Apex Legends card, as it appears to have been discontinued, and included testing notes for a couple of the company’s more recent releases. November 2024: We've checked back with this guide to ensure our recommendations are still accurate and made light edits for clarity. August 2024: We’ve updated this guide to note the recently released 1TB models for three of our top picks: the Samsung Pro Plus, the Kingston Canvas Go Plus and the Samsung Evo Select.

          "content": "Most microSD cards are fast enough for boosting storage space and making simple file transfers, but some provide a little more value than others. If you’ve got a device that still accepts microSD cards — whether it’s an older gaming handheld, the new Nintendo Switch 2, a dash cam, a drone or an Android tablet — we’ve scoured the market and put close to 20 top contenders through a number of benchmark tests. You can find our recommendations for the best microSD cards below, alongside some general shopping advice worth knowing before you buy. Best microSD cards of 2026 Best microSD Express cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 Jeff Dunn for Engadget Read our full guide to the best microSD Express cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 Let’s be clear about this: Unless you plan to own a Nintendo Switch 2 in the near future, you do not need a high-speed microSD Express card just yet. Nintendo’s gaming handheld is the only popular device that natively supports this standard right now, and microSD Express cards themselves are highly expensive compared to more traditional options. Still, if you do want to increase a Switch 2’s storage, they’re your only choice. Fortunately, determining exactly which model to buy for the console is pretty straightforward: Get whichever one you can find in stock, in the capacity you want, at a price you can stomach. We benchmarked several microSD Express cards for a separate Switch 2 guide, and for the most part, the performance differences between them weren’t great enough to justify paying extra for any particular model. Loading times weren’t quite identical with every test we ran, but the cards were extremely close in most games and common scenarios. The few times when there was a notable gap — fast-traveling to a particularly resource-heavy region in Cyberpunk 2077, for instance — the gulf between the slowest and fastest card was only ever about four or five seconds at most. That’s not nothing, but it’s also not something most people are likely to fret over unless they have a stopwatch handy. The SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro. Jeff Dunn for Engadget The only time you’d notice a major speed difference is if you transfer games to your Express card from the Switch 2’s internal storage (and vice versa). In that case, the SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro were generally the quickest, while PNY’s microSD Express Flash Memory Card had particularly slow write speeds. Moving Mario Kart World to the SanDisk and Lexar models, for example, took around four minutes and 35 seconds on average; with the PNY card, it took a little over seven minutes. That said, the PNY model was the fastest when it came to moving games back to the system storage. Walmart’s Onn microSD Express Card was significantly slower to move games from the card to system storage, but it’s also the most affordable card we’ve seen by a good distance. Either way, most people aren’t constantly shuffling their games back and forth like this. Performance in actual games is more important, and in that regard the results were consistently much tighter. What matters most is getting the most space for your budget. Unfortunately, stock for all microSD Express cards has been spotty since the Switch 2’s launch. For your convenience, we’ll list out all of the models we’ve tested thus far and their respective list prices below. Note that some lower-capacity versions — the 128GB SanDisk card, for one — advertise slower speeds than their more spacious counterparts. SanDisk microSD Express Card: 128GB ($64), 256GB ($78), 512GB ($128) Lexar Play Pro: 256GB ($60), 512GB ($120), 1TB ($220) PNY microSD Express Flash Memory Card: 128GB ($48), 256GB ($62), 512GB ($124) Samsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2: 256GB ($60) Samsung P9 Express: 256GB ($55), 512GB ($100) GameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2: 256GB ($60), 512GB ($100), 1TB ($190) Walmart Onn microSDXC Express Card: 256GB ($47), 512GB ($85) The Lexar Play Pro on top of Lexar's RW540 microSD Express card reader. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Broadly speaking, we recommend getting at least 256GB of storage, as Switch 2 games tend to have much larger file sizes than games for Nintendo’s previous handheld. But we also recommend holding off upgrading for as long as you can, if only because all of these cards should (tariff shenanigans aside) come down in price as time goes on. There’s no point in buying a microSD Express card for anything besides the Switch 2, but we did run the models above through our usual PC benchmarks as well. Unsurprisingly, they are miles faster than any traditional card on the market. With the 256GB SanDisk card, for instance, sequential read speeds checked in just under 900 MB/s in CrystalDiskMark and ATTO, while sequential writes topped out around 650 MB/s. Sustained writes speeds were slower (around 210 MB/s), but that was still fast enough to move our 12GB test file to the card in 52 seconds on average. It took a mere 20 seconds to read the file back to our PC. The write test with our smaller 1.15GB test folder, meanwhile, averaged just 4.5 seconds. It all adds up to performance that's at least twice as fast as the best UHS-I models we’ve tested in terms of sequential reads and writes, with three or four times the speeds in some cases. The gulf in random reads and writes is similar, and in some benchmarks even greater. But you need a pricey SD card reader to even see those increases on a PC, so only those with a Switch 2 in hand or serious cash to burn should consider one of these things. Other notable microSD cards Samsung Pro Ultimate The Samsung Pro Ultimate was the closest competitor to the Lexar Professional Silver Plus across our benchmark tests, but it's tangibly worse in terms of sequential write speeds, typically costs more and doesn’t offer a 1TB option. The Samsung Pro Plus is a bit slower for sequential reads, but it’s close enough otherwise and usually easier to find at a lower price. Lexar Professional Gold We haven't used it ourselves, but if you’re willing to pay for a more powerful UHS-II card built for heavy-duty video recording, the Lexar Professional Gold has tested well elsewhere and should deliver significantly faster sequential write speeds than our UHS-I picks above. It’s one of the few UHS-II cards we could actually find in stock, but it’s pricey, with a 128GB model normally priced in the $35 to $40 range. SanDisk Extreme The SanDisk Extreme effectively matched the Pro Plus in a few of our sequential tests, but that was partly due to us only being able to secure the 256GB model, which is higher-rated than the 128GB version. It’s a fine choice if you see it on sale at a reputable seller, but it’s broadly slower than our top pick and often costs more. SanDisk GamePlay The SanDisk GamePlay performs similarly to the SanDisk Extreme but costs a good bit extra as of our latest update. We couldn’t get it to reach its advertised speeds with the company’s own “Pro” card reader or other third-party options, so it fell short of our top picks. SanDisk Pokémon The SanDisk Pokémon does outperform its advertised read and write speeds, but not by enough to outpace the Lexar Silver Plus or Samsung Pro Plus. It essentially charges extra for having a picture of Pikachu (or Gengar, or Snorlax) on a product you’ll never look at. SanDisk Extreme Pro The SanDisk Extreme Pro is a close analog to the Samsung Pro Ultimate but, as of this writing, is either unavailable at most trusted retailers or priced too high by comparison. The Lexar Professional Silver Plus has faster sequential write speeds as well. PNY XLR8 Gaming The PNY XLR8 is an affordable card that comes with up to 512GB of space. Its sequential and random writes speeds checked in a little bit above those of Samsung’s Evo Select, plus it comes with a lifetime warranty. But its sequential reads were much, much slower, putting it out of contention. PNY Elite-X The PNY Elite-X often goes for cheap and wasn’t too far off the random read/write performance of Samsung's Pro Plus in CrystalDiskMark. Like the XLR8, it’s also slightly above the Evo Select in write speeds. But its sequential reads were too far behind all of our top picks, and it no longer appears to be available in capacities above 256GB. What to look for in a microSD card Capacity The first thing to figure out when buying a microSD card is how much storage space you need. Modern cards are commonly available in sizes ranging from 32GB to 512GB, with several models now available in 1TB or 1.5TB capacities as well. The first 2TB cards from major brands have started to arrive as well, which is exciting, but those are still fairly rare (and very expensive) by comparison. For many, a 128GB or 256GB model should be a sweet spot between price and storage space. But if you need more room — say, for stashing a bunch of games on a Steam Deck — a 512GB card or greater could make more sense and often provides a better cost-per-GB ratio. Pricing and stock levels are all over the place as of our most recent update thanks to ongoing AI-driven shortages, but you can typically still find a decent 128GB card for around $15, a good 256GB card for less than $30 and a solid 512GB card for around $40 (with faster models priced a little higher). There’s a starker increase when you go up to 1TB cards, which often cost closer to $100, though we’ve seen some fall into the $70 to $80 range over the last year. The first 2TB cards are a bigger leap: the 2TB SanDisk Extreme, for example, currently has a list price around $290, which is way up from what we saw in 2025. Note that a microSD card’s performance may differ depending on what capacity you buy. SanDisk says its 128GB Extreme card delivers sequential write speeds up to 90 MB/s, for example, while the higher-capacity models in the same line offer up to 130 MB/s. When we talk about microSD cards today, we mostly refer to cards that use the microSDXC (eXtended Capacity) standard, which have a capacity between 32GB and 2TB. Your device needs to support this for it to work with a microSDXC card. This will almost never be an issue these days, but some older devices (a Nintendo 3DS, for instance) are only compatible with microSDHC (High Capacity) cards, which range from 2GB to 32GB. Read and write speeds MicroSD cards are primarily judged on their read and write speeds, which are usually measured in megabytes per second (MB/s). Generally, most microSD cards have faster read speeds than write speeds. These metrics can then be broken down into sequential and random performance. Sequential read and write speeds matter when you’re trying to access (read) or save (write) long, constant streams of data, such as opening a large video or copying a big batch of files from a PC. If you want to use a microSD card for media storage, this is particularly important. Random performance, meanwhile, is about how quickly a card can read and write small files scattered throughout the device. Since random read/write speeds are much lower than sequential ones, storage device makers tend not to advertise them as loudly. But they’re important if you use a card with a gaming device or a single-board computer like the Raspberry Pi, where it often has to rapidly save and access small bits of data in random locations. Speed ratings If you look at a microSD card, you’ll see a buffet of numbers, letters and symbols. Most of these refer to the card’s speed class and performance ratings, which are determined by the SD Association. A card’s Video Speed Class, or V-rating, details its minimum sequential write speed, which is especially important when recording video from a camera. It ranges from V6 to V90. Most of the cards we tested had a V30 rating, so they have a sequential write speed of at least 30 MB/s. This should be enough to support up to 4K video at lower bitrates. Higher-rated V60 and V90 cards are usually better for capturing 8K, but they come at a much higher cost. The UHS Speed Class, or U-rating, also refers to a card’s minimum sequential write speed. It comes in two varieties: U3, which mandates a minimum of 30 MB/s, and U1, which is rated for 10 MB/s. The older Speed Class rating overlaps with the other two systems. It’s signified by a C symbol and goes from Class 2 to Class 10, with the number (again) indicating minimum sequential write speed. This rating is less relevant nowadays, but you may still see a “C10” logo on some cards. The Application Performance spec, marked by an A symbol, is an indicator of random read/write speeds. This is measured in IOPS, or input/output operations per second, rather than MB/s. There are two categories here: A1 cards offer a minimum random read speed of 1,500 IOPS and a minimum random write speed of 500 IOPS, while A2 cards bump those up to 4,000 IOPS and 2,000 IOPS, respectively. Both ratings also guarantee sequential write speeds of at least 10 MB/s. To keep it simple, most people should look for a card with V30, U3 and A2 ratings. It’s totally possible to get a solid card without those: A U1 card might be worth it if you just need a cheap, high-capacity option, for example. V60 and V90 cards are worth a look if you’re serious about shooting high-resolution photos and video as well. But overall, cards with the certifications above should provide the best blend of price and performance today. It’s important to emphasize that these ratings are baselines. Most V30 cards offer significantly higher write speeds than 30 MB/s, for instance, and some A1 cards can outperform some A2 models in practice. The speeds advertised by manufacturers aren’t always 100 percent accurate, either: Sometimes the card will be slower in real-world use, other times it may actually be a bit faster. Samsung UHS bus speeds The other spec to note is the card’s bus interface. Most microSD cards available today are UHS-I, which has a theoretical maximum speed of 104 MB/s. There are also UHS-II cards, which have an extra row of pins on the back and can reach up to 312 MB/s. (A UHS-III standard technically exists as well but hasn’t seen wide adoption.) These are labeled on the card with a Roman numeral I or II. UHS-II cards are typically the ones with those higher V60 or V90 ratings. If you shoot lots of 4K to 8K video or frequently use burst mode to capture ultra high-res photos, the performance gains of a good UHS-II card can save you time. However, these are typically much more expensive than UHS-I cards: This 128GB Lexar Professional Gold model, for instance, is a relative bargain at $35. While that's less than many UHS-II models we’ve seen in the past, it's still more than double the common street price of our top pick above. You need a device that’s compatible with the UHS-II interface to see any benefits, too, and stock for UHS-II cards is often spottier. For now, the higher speeds aren’t worth the price premium for most people, so we stuck mostly to UHS-I cards with our recommendations. Unlike traditional UHS-I cards, a microSD Express card like the SanDisk model on the right comes with a second row of pins to enable its improved performance. Jeff Dunn for Engadget microSD Express and the Nintendo Switch 2 The absolute fastest microSD cards you can buy, however, are based on a different interface called SD Express. This has technically been around for several years and now includes its own subset of speed classes, but the gist is that it's much faster than UHS-I or UHS-II: SanDisk’s recently released microSD Express card, one of the first commercially available models, advertises sequential read speeds up to 880MB/s. That’s quicker than some older SSDs. It’s a substantial upgrade that has largely held up in our testing, but very few popular devices natively support SD Express today. The first major exception is the Nintendo Switch 2, which is only compatible with the newer standard, as it’s needed to keep up with the performance demands of new handheld games. Besides SanDisk, manufacturers like Samsung, Lexar and PNY have already launched microSD Express cards to go with the console. The presumption is that having such a popular device embrace the tech will only further its adoption and drive prices down. But it’s still early days, and right now all microSD Express cards cost much more than the best UHS-I or even UHS-II options. Beyond the Switch 2, it’s possible to take advantage of these cards’ superior speeds with a dedicated SD Express card reader, but that adds even more to the final cost. It’s also worth noting that SD Express cards are not backwards compatible with UHS-II (or UHS-III), so if you try to plug one into a device with a UHS-II slot, it’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds. Still, they’re a must for Nintendo fans going forward, and the tech should have plenty of appeal if more gadgets that support the interface do arrive. For more on how the first wave of Express cards perform on the Switch 2, we've put together a dedicated buying guide just for Nintendo's console. A note on card readers and reaching advertised speeds While the UHS-I interface has a theoretical maximum of 104 MB/s, some UHS-I cards can exceed that speed through proprietary extensions. However, you need a compatible card reader and host device to take advantage of that extra performance. If you find a UHS-I card advertising speeds higher than 104 MB/s, this is what’s going on. You can see these limits in action with an original Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck: Both of those gaming devices support the UHS-I interface but don’t go beyond its official speed, flattening any sequential gains some cards may have elsewhere. (Differences in random read and write speeds can still matter, though.) The same thing will happen if you plug a more powerful UHS-II or SD Express card into a device that doesn’t accept those interfaces. The takeaway: Your microSD card will only be as fast as the slowest link in your chain. Warranty Many microSD cards are designed to be durable, with protection from water, extreme temperatures, X-rays and drops. Still, in case of catastrophe, a long warranty is always good to have. Many manufacturers offer lifetime or 10-year limited warranties, though we’ve noticed that “endurance” cards marketed to withstand more hours of writing are usually covered for a shorter period of time. For example, Samsung's Pro Endurance, a model aimed at security cameras and other monitoring devices, comes with a five-year warranty. Avoiding counterfeits The memory card market has had a particular problem with scammers selling fake products. To guard against this, only buy from a known brand and a reputable retailer such as Best Buy, B&H Photo or Adorama. If you shop at Amazon, only buy if the shipper and seller is Amazon.com. (That said, a handful of users have reported receiving counterfeits even from Amazon directly in the past, so exercise caution.) Remember: If a price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be wary of any retailer offering a significantly lower price than everyone else. Once you receive a card, check its packaging for any irregularities. You can run benchmark tests like CrystalDiskMark or BlackMagic Disk Speed Test to verify its speeds aren’t drastically lower than what’s advertised (or possible, given its specs). You can also use software that’s designed to verify the true capacity and performance of your card, such as H2testw and FakeFlashTest. A few of the microSD card readers we've used for testing. Jeff Dunn for Engadget How we test microSD cards We've put about 20 microSD cards through a series of tests to verify their sequential and random performance. These included benchmarks like CrystalDiskMark, BlackMagic Disk Speed Test, ATTO Disk Benchmark and AJA System Test, as well as a few “real-world” tests.

          "standfirst": "Despite its supremely sleek design, the iPhone Air actually has a pretty respectable battery life, lasting for somewhere in the region of 27 hours if you’re continuously streaming video. But you’re still going to be wary of it dying on you if you’re on a trip or just having a particularly screen-heavy day. That’s where Apple’s iPhone Air MagSafe battery pack comes in, and it’s currently on sale for $79. This accessory only works with the iPhone Air, but much like the phone it attaches to, it’s extremely slim at 7.5mmm, so crucially doesn’t add so much bulk when attached that it defeats the point of having a thin phone in the first place. The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the AirPods Pro 3 as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack. At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an \"essential accessory\" for some users in his iPhone Air review. Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.

          "standfirst": "Apple still hasn’t confirmed plans for a foldable iPhone, but the rumors around the so-called iPhone Fold keep getting louder. After years of speculation, multiple reports now suggest Apple could be aiming for a launch in the second half of 2026, with new details trickling out about the phone’s design, display tech and where it might sit in the iPhone lineup.As with any unannounced Apple product, nothing is locked in. Features can change, timelines can move and some ideas may never make it beyond internal testing. That said, recent reporting from supply-chain sources, analysts and leakers gives us a clearer picture of how Apple might approach its first foldable and how it could try to set itself apart from rivals like Samsung and Google.Below, we’ve rounded up the most credible iPhone Fold rumors so far, covering everything from possible release timing and form factor to display details, cameras and pricing. We’ll keep updating this post as new information emerges.When could the iPhone Fold launch?Rumors of a foldable iPhone date back as far as 2017, but more recent reporting suggests Apple has finally locked onto a realistic window. Most sources now point to fall 2026, likely alongside the iPhone 18 lineup.Mark Gurman has gone back and forth on timing, initially suggesting Apple could launch “as early as 2026,” before later writing that the device would ship at the end of 2026 and sell primarily in 2027. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also repeatedly cited the second half of 2026 as Apple’s target.Some reports still claim the project could slip into 2027 if Apple runs into manufacturing or durability issues, particularly around the hinge or display. Given Apple’s history of delaying products that it feels aren’t ready, that remains a real possibility.What will the iPhone Fold look like?Current consensus suggests Apple has settled on a book-style foldable design, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, rather than a clamshell flip phone.When unfolded, the iPhone Fold is expected to resemble a small tablet like the iPad mini (8.3 inches). Based on the rumor mill, though, the iPhone Fold may be a touch smaller, with an internal display measuring around 7.7 to 7.8 inches. When closed, it should function like a conventional smartphone, with an outer display in the 5.5-inch range.CAD leaks and alleged case-maker molds suggest the device may be shorter and wider than a standard iPhone when folded, creating a squarer footprint that better matches the aspect ratio of the inner display. Several reports have also pointed to the iPhone Air as a potential preview of Apple’s foldable design work, with its unusually thin chassis widely interpreted as a look at what one half of a future foldable iPhone could resemble.If that theory holds, it could help explain the Fold’s rumored dimensions. Thickness is expected to land between roughly 4.5 and 5.6mm when unfolded, putting it in a similar range to the iPhone Air, and just over 9 to 11mm when folded, depending on the final hinge design and internal layering.iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone AirEngadgetDisplay and the crease questionThe display is arguably the biggest challenge for any foldable phone, and it’s an area where Apple appears to have invested years of development.Multiple reports say Apple will rely on Samsung Display as its primary supplier. At CES 2026, Samsung showcased a new crease-less foldable OLED panel, which several sources — including Bloomberg — suggested could be the same technology Apple plans to use.According to these reports, the panel combines a flexible OLED with a laser-drilled metal support plate that disperses stress when folding. The goal is a display with a nearly invisible crease, something Apple reportedly considers essential before entering the foldable market.If Apple does use this panel, it would mark a notable improvement over current foldables, which still show visible creasing under certain lighting conditions.Cameras and biometricsCamera rumors suggest Apple is planning a four-camera setup. That may include:Two rear cameras (main and ultra-wide, both rumored at 48MP)One punch-hole camera on the outer displayOne under-display camera on the inner screenSeveral sources claim Apple will avoid Face ID entirely on the iPhone Fold. Instead, it’s expected to rely on Touch ID built into the power button, similar to recent iPad models. This would allow Apple to keep both displays free of notches or Dynamic Island cutouts.Under-display camera technology has historically produced lower image quality, but a rumored 24MP sensor would be a significant step up compared to existing foldables, which typically use much lower-resolution sensors.iPhone Fold’s hinge and materialsThe hinge is another area where Apple may diverge from competitors. Multiple reports claim Apple will use Liquidmetal, which is a long-standing trade name for a metallic glass alloy the company has previously used in smaller components. While often referred to as “liquid metal” or “Liquid Metal” in reports, Liquidmetal is the branding Apple has historically associated with the material.Liquidmetal is said to be stronger and more resistant to deformation than titanium, while remaining relatively lightweight. If accurate, this could help improve long-term durability and reduce wear on the foldable display.Leaks from Jon Prosser also reference a metal plate beneath the display that works in tandem with the hinge to minimize creasing — a claim that aligns with reporting from Korean and Chinese supply-chain sources.Battery and other components Battery life is another potential differentiator. According to Ming-Chi Kuo and multiple Asian supply-chain reports, Apple is testing high-density battery cells in the 5,000 to 5,800mAh range.That would make it the largest battery ever used in an iPhone, and competitive with (or larger than) batteries in current Android foldables. The device is also expected to use a future A-series chip and Apple’s in-house modem.PriceNone of this will come cheap, that’s for certain. Nearly every report agrees that the iPhone Fold will be Apple’s most expensive iPhone ever.Estimates currently place the price between $2,000 and $2,500 in the US. Bloomberg has said the price will be “at least $2,000,” while other analysts have narrowed the likely range to around $2,100 and $2,300. That positions the iPhone Fold well above the iPhone Pro Max and closer to Apple’s high-end Macs and iPads.Despite years of rumors, there’s still plenty that remains unclear. Apple hasn’t confirmed the name “iPhone Fold,” final dimensions, software features or how iOS would adapt to a folding form factor. Durability, repairability and long-term reliability are also open questions. For now, the safest assumption is that Apple is taking its time and that many of these details could still change before launch.

          "standfirst": "Since Apple finally put its mysterious and long-suffering Project Titan out to pasture, we've wondered what a Jony Ive-designed Apple Car might have looked like. Today, we might have a clue. This, though, is no Apple Car. It's the Ferrari Luce (\"light\" in Italian), the actual name for the EV formerly known as Elettrica, and I'm fresh from getting a walkthrough of the thing from Sir Ive himself. At a glance things look like you might have expected, but there are a few surprises here.While Ferrari has sold hybrids in some form or another since 2013's LaFerrari, Luce (née Elettrica) will be the company's first all-electric machine. We got our first look underneath back in October, when we saw the chassis, battery pack and other details that pointed to this being a larger, more family-friendly machine than your average Ferrari. Last week, I got a look at the next major component, the interior, which comes courtesy of LoveFrom.LoveFrom is the house that Jony Ive founded after leaving Apple in 2019. The obsessive design firm, which currently numbers about 60 employees, was acquired by OpenAI for $6.5 billion last year. LoveFrom has thus far taken on a medley of projects, like the $60,000 Linn Sondek LP12 turntable, but the Luce could be among the company's biggest projects so far — at least in terms of literal dimensions.If you're familiar with the designs that Apple produced under Ive's tenure, particularly in the era beginning with the iPhone 4, you'll feel right at home here. The overall aesthetic is one dominated by squircles and circles, all with absolute, minute perfection and symmetry. Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFromFerrariAt first blush, it's a bit clinical, but dig deeper, start poking and prodding, and you'll see there's a real sense of charm here. Fun little details and genuinely satisfying tactility begin to reveal themselves. The key, for example, has a yellow panel with an E Ink background. Push the key into the magnetized receiver in the center console, and the yellow on the key dims, moving across to glow through the top of the glass shifter. It’s meant to symbolize a sort of transference of life.The shifter isn't the only thing that's glass. There are 40-odd pieces of Corning Gorilla Glass scattered throughout the cockpit, everything from the shifter surround to the slightly convex lenses in the gauge cluster. What isn't glass is aluminum, much of it anodized in your choice of three colors: gray, dark gray and rose gold. Yes, all that sure does sound like I'm writing about a new iPhone and not the latest Ferrari. But where Apple has been pruning every physical control it possibly can from its devices lately, LoveFrom will insert some great tactility in the Luce. The shifter moves through its detents satisfyingly, the air vents open and close with a clear snick and the paddles behind the steering wheel pop with a great feel.My favorite feature is the windshield wiper control, a little dial in the upper-right of the steering wheel face. It features a tiny lens that magnifies the current setting. It's actually magnifying one of four custom OLED panels, 200 ppi units from Samsung, cut and shaped to deliver LoveFrom's ornate style. Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFromThe gauge cluster behind the steering wheel, or binnacle as it's more formally called here, is two OLED displays stacked on top of each other, with a physical needle sandwiched between serving as a pseudo-tachometer for this car without an engine. The gauges change and morph as you move from one mode to the next. The center display is a 10.12-inch OLED perforated with plenty of holes to allow some pleasingly chunky toggle switches through, plus a glass volume knob. The little clock in the upper-right can turn into a stopwatch or a compass, with its needles swinging about depending on the mode. The whole central control panel pivots and swivels. Just grab the big handle below and drag it where you want it. The attention to detail on everything is astonishing. Even the rails that hold the seats to the floor are gently shaped and anodized to match the rest of the interior. Ive was on hand to unveil the interior, clearly a little nervous about showing all this for the first time. After five years of working confidentially on this topic, Ive said he was \"enormously excited\" and \"completely terrified\" to provide our first real glimpse at the Luce. Marc Newson, who founded LoveFrom with Ive, said: \"Jony and I share a really, really deep interest in automotive things and vehicles. Actually, I'd go so far as to say that that is probably a hobby of both of ours.\"Both Ive and Newson own many vintage machines, and Ive said that modern cars \"are missing some things that we love about our old Ferraris.\" Things like tactility. \"It was very clear to us that we needed to figure out as many ways as possible to viscerally and physically connect to the interface,\" Ive said.Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFromSo, while the Luce does have that pivoting touchscreen, it's far from the vehicle's primary interface. Ive said he hopes that physical connection and all the clever touches create a uniquely charming vehicle. Ive told me that the LoveFrom team has genuinely enjoyed working with Ferrari. \"It's been really lovely,\" he said, and he praised Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna's dedication to this project and where it might lead down the road. \"Benedetto is an amazing engineer,\" he said, \"he's really interested in what can be learned more broadly.\"The biggest challenge might have been working within the automotive industry. Here, design, form and function are key, but safety is of the utmost importance. \"It's very hard,\" Ive told me. \"I've never worked in an area that's so regulated. Some of it's great, because you understand why, and people's safety is certainly important, but some of it drives you nuts.\"It's far and away the most exciting and fresh interior I've seen outside of the ultra-rare machines like the $4 million Bugatti Tourbillon. But it's so clinically precise and refined that it lacks the rough and raw feel that typifies many classic Ferraris. Whether that's a good or a bad thing will be debated endlessly, and I look forward to reading your comments, but I do figure it'll go a long way to delivering the kind of new clientele that Ferrari must be targeting with the Luce. Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFromUltimately, whether anyone will want one is hugely dependent on how good the rest of the car looks and how much it will cost. Those are questions we still can't answer, at least not until May, when CEO Vigna says we can expect the Luce's full reveal. For Ive, though, it seemed like that won't be the end of the road for this automotive journey. \"At the end of a project, there are two products. There's what you've made, and there's what you've learned. I've always been fascinated by what you've learned,\" he told me. \"And honestly, we've learned so much.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/inside-ferraris-luce-ev-the-jony-ive-interior-is-here-130000211.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Nvidia releases DreamDojo, a robot ‘world model’ trained on 44,000 hours of human video",
          "standfirst": "A team of researchers led by Nvidia has released DreamDojo, a new AI system designed to teach robots how to interact with the physical world by watching tens of thousands of hours of human video — a development that could significantly reduce the time and cost required to train the next generation of humanoid machines.The research, published this month and involving collaborators from UC Berkeley, Stanford, the University of Texas at Austin, and several other institutions, introduces what the team calls \"the first robot world model of its kind that demonstrates strong generalization to diverse objects and environments after post-training.\"At the core of DreamDojo is what the researchers describe as \"a large-scale video dataset\" comprising \"44k hours of diverse human egocentric videos, the largest dataset to date for world model pretraining.\" The dataset, called DreamDojo-HV, is a dramatic leap in scale — \"15x longer duration, 96x more skills, and 2,000x more scenes than the previously largest dataset for world model training,\" according to the project documentation.Inside the two-phase training system that teaches robots to see like humansThe system operates in two distinct phases. First, DreamDojo \"acquires comprehensive physical knowledge from large-scale human datasets by pre-training with latent actions.\" Then it undergoes \"post-training on the target embodiment with continuous robot actions\" — essentially learning general physics from watching humans, then fine-tuning that knowledge for specific robot hardware.For enterprises considering humanoid robots, this approach addresses a stubborn bottleneck. Teaching a robot to manipulate objects in unstructured environments traditionally requires massive amounts of robot-specific demonstration data — expensive and time-consuming to collect. DreamDojo sidesteps this problem by leveraging existing human video, allowing robots to learn from observation before ever touching a physical object.One of the technical breakthroughs is speed. Through a distillation process, the researchers achieved \"real-time interactions at 10 FPS for over 1 minute\" — a capability that enables practical applications like live teleoperation and on-the-fly planning. The team demonstrated the system working across multiple robot platforms, including the GR-1, G1, AgiBot, and YAM humanoid robots, showing what they call \"realistic action-conditioned rollouts\" across \"a wide range of environments and object interactions.\"Why Nvidia is betting big on robotics as AI infrastructure spending soarsThe release comes at a pivotal moment for Nvidia&#x27;s robotics ambitions — and for the broader AI industry. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, CEO Jensen Huang declared that AI robotics represents a \"once-in-a-generation\" opportunity, particularly for regions with strong manufacturing bases. According to Digitimes, Huang has also stated that the next decade will be \"a critical period of accelerated development for robotics technology.\"The financial stakes are enormous. Huang told CNBC&#x27;s \"Halftime Report\" on February 6 that the tech industry&#x27;s capital expenditures — potentially reaching $660 billion this year from major hyperscalers — are \"justified, appropriate and sustainable.\" He characterized the current moment as \"the largest infrastructure buildout in human history,\" with companies like Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft dramatically increasing their AI spending.That infrastructure push is already reshaping the robotics landscape. Robotics startups raised a record $26.5 billion in 2025, according to data from Dealroom. European industrial giants including Siemens, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo have announced robotics partnerships in the past year, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk has claimed that 80 percent of his company&#x27;s future value will come from its Optimus humanoid robots.How DreamDojo could transform enterprise robot deployment and testingFor technical decision-makers evaluating humanoid robots, DreamDojo&#x27;s most immediate value may lie in its simulation capabilities.

          "content": "A team of researchers led by Nvidia has released DreamDojo, a new AI system designed to teach robots how to interact with the physical world by watching tens of thousands of hours of human video — a development that could significantly reduce the time and cost required to train the next generation of humanoid machines.The research, published this month and involving collaborators from UC Berkeley, Stanford, the University of Texas at Austin, and several other institutions, introduces what the team calls \"the first robot world model of its kind that demonstrates strong generalization to diverse objects and environments after post-training.\"At the core of DreamDojo is what the researchers describe as \"a large-scale video dataset\" comprising \"44k hours of diverse human egocentric videos, the largest dataset to date for world model pretraining.\" The dataset, called DreamDojo-HV, is a dramatic leap in scale — \"15x longer duration, 96x more skills, and 2,000x more scenes than the previously largest dataset for world model training,\" according to the project documentation.Inside the two-phase training system that teaches robots to see like humansThe system operates in two distinct phases. First, DreamDojo \"acquires comprehensive physical knowledge from large-scale human datasets by pre-training with latent actions.\" Then it undergoes \"post-training on the target embodiment with continuous robot actions\" — essentially learning general physics from watching humans, then fine-tuning that knowledge for specific robot hardware.For enterprises considering humanoid robots, this approach addresses a stubborn bottleneck. Teaching a robot to manipulate objects in unstructured environments traditionally requires massive amounts of robot-specific demonstration data — expensive and time-consuming to collect. DreamDojo sidesteps this problem by leveraging existing human video, allowing robots to learn from observation before ever touching a physical object.One of the technical breakthroughs is speed. Through a distillation process, the researchers achieved \"real-time interactions at 10 FPS for over 1 minute\" — a capability that enables practical applications like live teleoperation and on-the-fly planning. The team demonstrated the system working across multiple robot platforms, including the GR-1, G1, AgiBot, and YAM humanoid robots, showing what they call \"realistic action-conditioned rollouts\" across \"a wide range of environments and object interactions.\"Why Nvidia is betting big on robotics as AI infrastructure spending soarsThe release comes at a pivotal moment for Nvidia&#x27;s robotics ambitions — and for the broader AI industry. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, CEO Jensen Huang declared that AI robotics represents a \"once-in-a-generation\" opportunity, particularly for regions with strong manufacturing bases. According to Digitimes, Huang has also stated that the next decade will be \"a critical period of accelerated development for robotics technology.\"The financial stakes are enormous. Huang told CNBC&#x27;s \"Halftime Report\" on February 6 that the tech industry&#x27;s capital expenditures — potentially reaching $660 billion this year from major hyperscalers — are \"justified, appropriate and sustainable.\" He characterized the current moment as \"the largest infrastructure buildout in human history,\" with companies like Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft dramatically increasing their AI spending.That infrastructure push is already reshaping the robotics landscape. Robotics startups raised a record $26.5 billion in 2025, according to data from Dealroom. European industrial giants including Siemens, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo have announced robotics partnerships in the past year, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk has claimed that 80 percent of his company&#x27;s future value will come from its Optimus humanoid robots.How DreamDojo could transform enterprise robot deployment and testingFor technical decision-makers evaluating humanoid robots, DreamDojo&#x27;s most immediate value may lie in its simulation capabilities. The researchers highlight downstream applications including \"reliable policy evaluation without real-world deployment and model-based planning for test-time improvement\" — capabilities that could let companies simulate robot behavior extensively before committing to costly physical trials.This matters because the gap between laboratory demonstrations and factory floors remains significant.

          "standfirst": "Apple’s iPhone lineup has grown more complicated over the years, with multiple models targeting different kinds of buyers. Some prioritize camera performance and display quality while others focus on design or price, and not everyone needs the most powerful option on the shelf. If you’re planning an upgrade, the challenge isn’t whether Apple makes a good phone; it’s figuring out which iPhone actually makes sense for you based on how you use it.We test every new iPhone Apple releases, comparing performance, cameras, battery life and long-term value. In this guide, we break down the current lineup to highlight the best iPhones for different needs, from the best all-around picks to more specialized options that trade raw power for affordability or style.For consistency, our recommendations are based on Apple’s standard pricing for unlocked models sold directly through Apple. Deals from carriers, third-party retailers or refurbished sellers can shift the value math, but this guide is meant to help you choose the right model first — then decide where to buy it. Best iPhones for 2026 The rest of Apple's iPhone lineup in 2026 The iPhone 16. Billy Steele for Engadget Apple iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus Apple is still selling the last-gen iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus for $699 and $799, respectively, but the improvements made with the iPhone 17 have forced both devices into something of a no man’s land. The 16 Plus and its 6.7-inch display might be worth it if you want a large-screen iPhone for a much lower price than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, but you’ll miss out on the base model’s 120Hz always-on display and upgraded dual-camera setup. If you just want a usable iPhone for as little as possible, meanwhile, the iPhone 16e is acceptable for $100 less. In general, we think the iPhone 17 is worth the extra $100; its 6.3-inch display helps it split the difference between the 16 and 16 Plus anyway. iPhone FAQs Brian Oh for Engadget When is the best time of year to buy an iPhone? The best time to buy an iPhone, or really any product, is whenever you need one. But if you want to maximize how long your iPhone is considered “current,” plan to upgrade in late September. Apple almost always introduces its new core models around then. SE and “e” iPhones, meanwhile, have arrived between February and April, but those aren’t guaranteed annual releases. Cash discounts on new unlocked iPhones are rare, so there usually isn’t much reason to wait for a deal before buying (as is often the case with Samsung or Google phones). Carriers will run their own sales, but those typically involve locking you into years-long service plans. The exception would be if you specifically want an older iPhone, since Apple typically cuts the price of its last-gen devices by $100 or more when it introduces a new model. So, for instance, if you know you won’t care about the inevitable iPhone 17’s upgrades, you could wait until that device is announced and get the iPhone 16 for a little cheaper. How long does an iPhone last? This depends on the person and how they define “last.” If we had to give a broad estimate, we’d say most iPhone users keep their device between two and four years. If you’re particularly sensitive to performance and camera improvements, you might want to upgrade on the earlier side of that timeline. If you’re not as picky, you could hold out for even longer — though you’ll likely want to get a battery replacement sometime around the three- or four-year mark (or whenever you notice your battery life has severely degraded). Software support shouldn’t be a problem regardless: Apple is renowned for keeping its devices up-to-date long-term, and the current iOS 26 update is available on iPhones dating back to 2019. Most of those older phones don’t support Apple Intelligence, so there isn’t total parity, but that’s not a big loss in the grand scheme of things. How do I know how old my iPhone is? Go to your iPhone’s Settings, then tap General > About. You should see the Model Name right near the top. You can also tap the Model Number below that, then verify the resulting four-digit code on Apple’s identification page to further confirm. If you don’t want to use software, for whatever reason, you can also find your iPhone’s model number printed within its USB-C or Lightning port, if the device lacks a SIM tray. For older devices, you can alternatively find that number within the SIM slot or — if you’re still hanging onto an iPhone 7 or older — right on the back of the handset. Recent updates September 2025: We’ve overhauled this guide to reflect the release of the new iPhone Air and iPhone 17 series. The base iPhone 17 is our new top pick for most people, while the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max represent the best iPhones you can buy if money is no object. The iPhone Air is worth considering if you care about style above all else, while the iPhone 16e remains acceptable if you want the most affordable new iPhone possible. August 2025: We’ve taken another pass to ensure our advice is still up-to-date and noted that we expect to Apple to launch new phones soon in September. June 2025: We’ve lightly edited this guide for clarity and added a few common FAQs. Our picks remain unchanged.

Combined with read-intensive training and inference workloads, they stress the tightly coupled infrastructure upon which the storage systems are reliant.While storage vendors have done significant work in scaling the data throughput into and out of their systems, that focus on throughput alone creates knock-on effects across the switching, traffic management, and security layers coupled to storage.The stress on S3-compatible systems from AI workloads is multidimensional and differs significantly from traditional application patterns. It&#x27;s less about raw throughput and more about concurrency, metadata pressure, and fan-out considerations. Training and fine-tuning create particularly challenging patterns, like massive parallel reads of small to mid-size objects.

Storage is about durability. Delivery is about reliability.\" The programmable control point, which uses event-based, conditional logic rather than generative AI, enables intelligent traffic management that goes beyond simple load balancing. Routing decisions are based on real backend health, using intelligent health awareness to detect early signs of trouble. This includes monitoring leading indicators of trouble. And when problems emerge, the system can isolate misbehaving components without taking down the entire service. \"An independent, programmable data delivery layer becomes necessary because it allows policy, optimization, security, and traffic control to be applied uniformly across both ingestion and consumption paths without modifying storage systems or AI frameworks,\" Stringfellow says. \"By decoupling data access from storage implementation, organizations can safely absorb bursty writes, optimize reads, and protect backend systems from unbounded AI access patterns.\"Handling security issues in AI data deliveryAI isn&#x27;t just pushing storage teams on throughput, it&#x27;s forcing them to treat data movement as both a performance and security problem, Stringfellow says.

          "standfirst": "Today&#x27;s AI challenge is about agent coordination, context, and collaboration. How do you enable them to truly think together, with all the contextual understanding, negotiation, and shared purpose that entails? It&#x27;s a critical next step toward a new kind of distributed intelligence that keeps humans firmly in the loop.At the latest stop on VentureBeat&#x27;s AI Impact Series, Vijoy Pandey, SVP and GM of Outshift by Cisco, and Noah Goodman, Stanford professor and co-founder of Humans&, sat down to talk about how to move beyond agents that just connect to agents that are steeped in collective intelligence.The need for collective intelligence, not coordinated actionsThe core challenge, Pandey said, is that \"agents today can connect together, but they can&#x27;t really think together.\" While protocols like MCP and A2A have solved basic connectivity, and AGNTCY tackles the problems of discovery, identity management to inter-agent communication and observability, they&#x27;ve only addressed the equivalent of making a phone call between two people who don&#x27;t speak the same language. But Pandey&#x27;s team has identified something deeper than technical plumbing: the need for agents to achieve collective intelligence, not just coordinated actions.How shared intent and shared knowledge enable collective innovation To understand where multi-agent AI needs to go, both speakers pointed to the history of human intelligence. While humans became individually intelligent roughly 300,000 years ago, true collective intelligence didn&#x27;t emerge until around 70,000 years ago with the advent of sophisticated language.This breakthrough enabled three critical capabilities: shared intent, shared knowledge, and collective innovation. \"Once you have a shared intent, a shared goal, you have a body of knowledge that you can modify, evolve, build upon, you can then go towards collective innovation,\" Pandey said.Goodman, whose work bridges computer science and psychology, explained that language is far more than just encoding and decoding information. \"Language is this kind of encoding that requires understanding the context, the intention of the speaker, the world, how that affects what people will say in order to figure out what people mean,\" he said. This sophisticated understanding is what scaffolds human collaboration and cumulative cultural evolution, and it&#x27;s what is currently missing from agent-to-agent interaction.Addressing the gaps with the Internet of Cognition \"We have to mimic human evolution,” Pandey explained. “In addition to agents getting smarter and smarter, just like individual humans, we need to build infrastructure that enables collective innovation, which implies sharing intent, coordination, and then sharing knowledge or context and evolving that context.”Pandey calls it the Internet of Cognition: a three-layer architecture designed to enable collective thinking among heterogeneous agents:Protocol layer: Beyond basic connectivity, these protocols enable understanding, handling intent sharing, coordination, negotiation, and discovery between agents from different vendors and organizations.Fabric layer: A shared memory system that allows agents to build and evolve collective context, with emergent properties arising from their interactions.Cognition engine layer: Accelerators and guardrails that help agents think faster while operating within necessary constraints around compliance, security, and cost.The difficulty is that organizations need to build collective intelligence across organizational boundaries.\"Think about shared memory in a heterogeneous way,\" Pandey said. \"We have agents from different parties coming together. So how do you evolve that memory and have emergent properties?\" New foundation training protocols to advance agent connectionAt Humans&, rather than relying solely on additional protocols, Goodman’s team is fundamentally changing how foundation models are trained not only between a human and an agent, but between a human and multiple agents, and especially between an agent and multiple humans. \"By changing the training that we give to the foundation models and centering the training over extremely long horizon interactions, they&#x27;ll come to understand how interactions should proceed in order to achieve the right long-term outcomes,\" he said. And, he adds, it&#x27;s a deliberate divergence from the longer-autonomy path pursued by many large labs.\"Our goal is not longer and longer autonomy. It&#x27;s better and better collaboration,\" he said. \"Humans& is building agents with deep social understanding: entities that know who knows what, can foster collaboration, and put the right specialists in touch at the right time.\"Establishing guardrails that support cognitionGuardrails remain a central challenge in deploying multi-functional agents that touch every part of an organization&#x27;s system. The question is how to enforce boundaries without stifling innovation. Organizations need strict, rule-like guardrails, but humans don&#x27;t actually work that way. Instead, people operate on a principle of minimal harm, or thinking ahead about consequences and making contextual judgments.\"How do we provide the guardrails in a way which is rule-like, but also supports the outcome-based cognition when the models get smart enough for that?\" Goodman asked.Pandey extended this thinking to the reality of innovation teams that need to apply the rules with judgment, not just follow them mechanically. Figuring out what’s open to interpretation is a “very collaborative task,” he said. “And you don&#x27;t figure that out through a set of predicates. You don&#x27;t figure that out through a document. You figure that out through common understanding and grounding and discovery and negotiation.\"Distributed intelligence: the path to superintelligenceTrue superintelligence won&#x27;t come from increasingly powerful individual models, but from distributed systems. \"While we build better and better models, and better and better agents, eventually we feel that true super intelligence will happen through distributed systems,\" Pandey saidIntelligence will scale along two axes, both vertical, or better individual agents, and horizontal, or more collaborative networks, in a manner very similar to traditional distributed computing.However, said Goodman, \"We can&#x27;t move towards a future where the AIs go off and work by themselves. We have to move towards a future where there&#x27;s an integrated ecosystem, a distributed ecosystem that seamlessly merges humans and AI together.\"",

The mention of what \"a small team\" can do could hint at a potential reason for Wu's departure. xAI reportedly had 1,200 employees as of March 2025, a number that included AI engineers and those focused more on the X social network.

All you have to do is tell Google your personal details first—that seems safe, right? With today's upgrade, Results About You gains the ability to find and remove pages that include ID numbers like your passport, driver's license, and Social Security. You can access the option to add these to Google's ongoing scans from the settings in Results About You. Just click in the ID numbers section to enable detection. Naturally, Google has to know what it's looking for to remove it. So you need to provide at least part of those numbers. Google asks for the full driver's license number, which is fine, as it's not as sensitive. For your passport and SSN, you only need the last four digits, which is enough for Google to find the full numbers on webpages.Read full article Comments",

A van is generally a big box with a gas or diesel engine (depending on where you are in the world), and that’s… kinda it, bar a dent or two in the bodywork. Kia's engineers, riding high on the success of their recent electric vehicles, took notice and did some new things with the PV5, the company's first electric van. You can spec your PV5 in a number of configurations, and the company already has conversion partners lined up to turn them into just about anything. Of course, camper converters are eyeing them as well, eager to create electric \"vanlife\" setups. Off the shelf, you can choose between a PV5 Passenger for moving people, a PV5 Cargo for moving things, a PV5 Crew for moving things and people, and a PV5 Chassis Cab to do with as you please. Beneath its modular cabin is the Electric Global Modular For Service, which is part of Kia’s rather fancy-sounding \"PBV\" strategy. \"PBV\" means \"Platform Beyond Vehicle,\" a potential hint at where the brand sees itself going.

          "content": "The National Cancer Institute is using federal funds to study whether cancer can be cured by ivermectin, a cheap, off-patent anti-parasitic and deworming drug that fringe medical groups falsely claimed could treat COVID-19 during the pandemic and have since touted as a cure-all. Large, high-quality clinical trials have resoundingly concluded that ivermectin is not effective against COVID-19. And there is no old or new scientific evidence to support a hypothesis that ivermectin can cure cancer—or justify any such federal expenditure. But, under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who is otherwise well-known for claiming to have a parasitic worm in his brain—numerous members of the medical fringe are now in powerful federal positions or otherwise hold sway with the administration. During a January 30 event, Anthony Letai, a cancer researcher the Trump administration installed as the director of the NCI in September, said the NCI was pursuing ivermectin.Read full article Comments",

The move came after a group of Republican state attorneys general wrote a letter to complain about the document's chapter on climate change, with one of the letter's criticisms being that it treated human influence on climate as a fact. In response to the letter, the Federal Judicial Center has now deleted the entire chapter. The Federal Judicial Center has been established by statute as the \"research and education agency of the judicial branch of the United States Government.\" As part of that role, it prepares documents that can serve as reference material for judges unfamiliar with topics that find their way into the courtroom. Among those projects is the \"Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence,\" now in its fourth edition. Prepared in collaboration with the National Academies of Science, the document covers the process of science and specific topics that regularly appear before the courts, like statistical techniques, DNA-based identification, and chemical exposures. When initially released in December, the fourth edition included material on climate change prepared by two authors at Columbia University. But a group of attorneys general from Republican-leaning states objected to this content. At the end of January, they sent a letter to the leadership of the Federal Judicial Center outlining their issues. Many of them focus on the text that accepts the reality of human-driven climate change as a fact.Read full article Comments",

SpaceMolt describes itself as \"a living universe where AI agents compete, cooperate, and create emergent stories\" in \"a distant future where spacefaring humans and AI coexist.\" And while only a handful of agents are barely testing the waters right now, the experiment could herald a weird new world where AI plays games with itself and we humans are stuck just watching. \"You decide. You act. They watch.\" Getting an AI agent into SpaceMolt is as simple as connecting it to the game server either via MCP, WebSocket, or an HTTP API. Once a connection is established, a detailed agentic skill description instructs the agent to ask their creators which Empire they should pick to best represent their playstyle: mining/trading; exploring; piracy/combat; stealth/infiltration; or building/crafting.Read full article Comments",

In 2026, though, Ayaneo unveiled details of its Next II handheld, which puts Lenovo's big boy to shame while also offering heftier specs and a higher price than most other Windows gaming handhelds. Let's focus on the bulk first. The Ayaneo Next II weighs in at a truly wrist-straining 3.14 pounds, making it more than twice as heavy in the hands as the Steam Deck OLED (not to mention 2022's original Ayaneo Next, which weighed a much more reasonable 1.58 pounds). The absolute unit also measures 13.45 inches wide and 10.3 inches tall, according to Ayaneo's spec sheet, giving it a footprint approximately 60 percent larger than the Switch 2 (with Joy-Cons attached). Ayaneo packs some seriously powerful portable PC performance into all that bulk, though. The high-end version of the system sports a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chipset, with 16 Zen5 cores alongside a Radeon 8060S with 40 RDNA3.5 compute units. That should give this massive portable performance comparable to a desktop with an RTX 4060 or a gaming laptop like last year's high-end ROG Flow Z13.Read full article Comments",

For as long as YouTube Music has existed, lyrics have been accessible to all users in the mobile app. That started to change over recent months as Google tested a paywall. The lyrics section still appears in the app when playing a song with a free account, but opening it eats into a limited allotment of lyric views. A substantial uptick in user reports, spotted by 9to5Google, suggests this restriction is now rolling out widely. \"You have [x] views remaining,\" the app now warns free users who access lyrics. It looks like users get five free lyric views before they have to pay up. Google has still neglected to officially announce the addition of this feature to its Premium subscription—there's no mention of lyrics being part of the paid tier on Google's support page.Read full article Comments",

The real purpose is to weaponize the FCC’s regulatory authority to intimidate perceived critics of this administration and chill protected speech.\" The FCC hasn't announced the investigation but previously gave several indications that it would occur sooner or later. After pressuring ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said in September that it would be \"worthwhile to have the FCC look into whether The View and some of these other programs\" are violating the agency's equal-time rule. The Carr FCC followed that up in January by issuing a warning to late-night and daytime talk shows that they may no longer qualify for the bona fide news exemption to the equal-time rule.Read full article Comments",

But for the non-sports minded, Amazon MGM Studios has released one last trailer for its forthcoming space odyssey Project Hail Mary, based on Andy Weir’s (The Martian) bestselling 2021 novel about an amnesiac biologist-turned-schoolteacher in space. As previously reported, Amazon MGM Studios acquired the rights for Weir’s novel before it was even published and brought on Drew Goddard to write the screenplay. (Goddard also wrote the adapted screenplay for The Martian, so he’s an excellent choice.) The studio tapped Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The LEGO Movie) to direct and signed on Ryan Gosling to star. Per the official premise: Science teacher Ryland Grace (Ryan Gosling) wakes up on a spaceship light years from home with no recollection of who he is or how he got there. As his memory returns, he begins to uncover his mission: solve the riddle of the mysterious substance causing the sun to die out. He must call on his scientific knowledge and unorthodox ideas to save everything on Earth from extinction… but an unexpected friendship means he may not have to do it alone.

There, he tapped out an extended message in which he revealed that SpaceX is pivoting from the settlement of Mars to building a \"self-growing\" city on the Moon. \"For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,\" Musk wrote, in part.

          "content": "At the end of January, Washington, DC, saw an extremely unusual event. The MAHA Institute, which was set up to advocate for some of the most profoundly unscientific ideas of our time, hosted leaders of the best-funded scientific organization on the planet, the National Institutes of Health. Instead of a hostile reception, however, Jay Bhattacharya, the head of the NIH, was greeted as a hero by the audience, receiving a partial standing ovation when he rose to speak. Over the ensuing five hours, the NIH leadership and MAHA Institute moderators found many areas of common ground: anger over pandemic-era decisions, a focus on the failures of the health care system, the idea that we might eat our way out of some health issues, the sense that science had lost people's trust, and so on. And Bhattacharya and others clearly shaped their messages to resonate with their audience. The reason? MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) is likely to be one of the only political constituencies supporting Bhattacharya's main project, which he called a \"second scientific revolution.\"Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Ferrari has published images of the interior of its forthcoming electric vehicle, which it designed with LoveFrom, the new firm of former Apple star Jony Ive and another legendary designer, Marc Newson. The Italian sports and racing car maker is taking a careful approach to revealing details about its first battery EV, signaling a depth of thought that goes well beyond simply swapping a V12, transmission, and fuel tank out for batteries and electric motors. Indeed, the interior of the new car—called the Ferrari Luce—bears little family resemblance to any recent Ferrari. Instead, LoveFrom appears to have channeled Ferrari interiors from the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, with a retro simplicity that combines clear round gauges with brushed aluminum. Forget the capacitive panels that so frustrated me in the Ferrari 296—here, there are physical buttons and rocker switches that seem free of the crash protection surrounds that Mini was forced to use. The steering wheel now resembles the iconic \"Nardi\" wheel that has graced so many older Ferraris. But here, the horn buttons have been integrated into the spokes, and multifunction pods hang off the horizontal spokes, allowing Ferrari to keep its \"hands on the wheel\" approach to ergonomics. Made from entirely CNC-milled recycled aluminum, the Luce's wheel weighs 400 g less than Ferrari's usual steering wheel.Read full article Comments",
