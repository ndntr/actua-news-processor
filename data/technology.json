OpenAI also launched a new iOS social app that allows users to insert themselves into AI-generated videos through what OpenAI calls \"cameos.\" OpenAI showcased the new model in an AI-generated video that features a photorealistic version of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman talking to the camera in a slightly unnatural-sounding voice amid fantastical backdrops, like a competitive ride-on duck race and a glowing mushroom garden. Regarding that voice, the new model can create what OpenAI calls \"sophisticated background soundscapes, speech, and sound effects with a high degree of realism.\" In May, Google's Veo 3 became the first video-synthesis model from a major AI lab to generate synchronized audio as well as video. Just a few days ago, Alibaba released Wan 2.5, an open-weights video model that can generate audio as well. Now OpenAI has joined the audio party with Sora 2.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "The UK government is reportedly once again demanding that Apple provide it with backdoor access to encrypted iCloud user data, following claims that the effort had been abandoned in August. The Financial Times reports that a new technical capability notice (TCN) was issued by the UK Home Office in early September, this time specifically targeting access to British citizens’ iCloud backups. This follows the UK issuing a broader secret order in January, demanding that Apple create a backdoor for security officials to access global encrypted user files. While it’s a criminal offense to reveal the existence of these secret TCN orders, Apple responded by filing an appeal and removing a feature, Advanced Data Protection, its end-to-end encrypted iCloud storage, from the UK. After facing pressure from the US regarding potential violations of the Cloud Act, it was announced by US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that Britain had rescinded the order. “The UK has agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a ‘back door’ that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties,” Gabbard posted to X on August 19th. While US officials raised concerns about the order during President Trump’s state visit to the UK last month, according to The Financial Times, the publication reports that two senior British government figures said the UK was no longer facing US pressure to drop its demands. We have reached out to Apple for comment. The UK Home Office declined to comment on the situation. The UK’s revived attempt to bypass Apple’s data encryption has sparked concerns that security and privacy may still be impacted for users worldwide. “If Apple breaks end-to-end encryption for the UK, it breaks it for everyone,” said Privacy International, a non-profit privacy watchdog. “The resulting vulnerability can be exploited by hostile states, criminals and other bad actors the world over.”",

They come equipped with SIM cards that work with 3G/4G/5G cellular networks and can be controlled by text message, Python scripts, and web interfaces. An unsophisticated, yet effective, delivery vector Security company Sekoia on Tuesday said that an analysis of “suspicious network traces” detected in its honeypots led to the discovery of a cellular router being abused to send SMS messages with phishing URLs. As company researchers investigated further, they identified more than 18,000 such routers accessible on the Internet, with at least 572 of them allowing free access to programming interfaces to anyone who took the time to look for them. The vast majority of the routers were running firmware versions that were more than three years out of date and had known vulnerabilities.Read full article Comments",

A team of archaeologists recently examined animal bones at sites dating to the waning years of the last Ice Age. Their results suggest that extinct megafauna like giant sloths, giant armadillos, and elephant-like creatures were on the menu for Pleistocene hunters in South America. And that means human hunters may have played a nontrivial role in killing off the continent’s last great Ice Age megafauna. Giant ground sloth: It’s what’s for dinner Archaeologist Luciano Prates of Mexico's National University of La Plata and his colleagues counted the animal bones left behind by ancient people at 20 archaeological sites in modern-day Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. They compared the number of bones from extinct megafauna (technically, “megafauna” describes any animal over 44 kilograms) to the number of bones from smaller prey. They also tallied the remains of still-living species of megafauna like vicuñas. The archaeologists hoped to learn whether giant sloths, giant armadillos, and now-extinct species of horses were staples in the diets of Ice Age South Americans.Read full article Comments",

That kind of learning could underpin a robust version of a so-called \"world model\" that would represent a major breakthrough in generative AI's actual operant real-world capabilities. Recently, Google's DeepMind Research tried to add some scientific rigor to how well video models can actually learn about the real world from their training data. In the bluntly titled paper \"Video Models are Zero-shot Learners and Reasoners,\" the researchers used Google's Veo 3 model to generate thousands of videos designed to test its abilities across dozens of tasks related to perceiving, modeling, manipulating, and reasoning about the real world. In the paper, the researchers boldly claim that Veo 3 \"can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn’t explicitly trained for\" (that's the \"zero-shot\" part of the title) and that video models \"are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models.\" But digging into the actual results of those experiments, the researchers seem to be grading today's video models on a bit of a curve and assuming future progress will smooth out many of today's highly inconsistent results.Read full article Comments",

Del Toro has been telling interviewers for years about his enduring love for Mary Shelley's novel and his long-standing desire to direct a film that would capture the novel's sense of grand Miltonian tragedy. He loved the original script for Kenneth Branagh's 1994 adaptation, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, but the final film, alas, deviated sharply from that script and was just not that good. After several false starts, del Toro finally signed on to film his vision for Netflix in 2023. He called this film “the culmination of a journey that has occupied most of my life,” at the Netflix Tudum event earlier this year, adding, “Monsters have become my personal belief system. There are strands of Frankenstein through my films.” \"It was a religion for me,\" del Toro said during a press conference at the film's world premiere in Venice last month. \"Since I was a kid—I was raised very Catholic—I never quite understood the saints. And then when I saw Boris Karloff on the screen, I understood what a saint or a messiah looked like. So I've been following the creature since I was a kid, and I always waited for the movie to be done in the right conditions, both creatively in terms of achieving the scope that it needed for me to make it different, to make it at a scale that you could reconstruct the whole world.\"Read full article Comments",

Two weeks later, OpenAI announced it would start predicting users' ages to improve safety more broadly. Then, this week, OpenAI introduced parental controls for ChatGPT and its video generator, Sora 2. Those controls allow parents to limit their teens' use and even get access to information about chat logs in \"rare cases\" where OpenAI's \"system and trained reviewers detect possible signs of serious safety risk.\"Read full article Comments",

Once in power, the Republicans moved quickly to make this happen. Federal clean vehicle incentives had only recently been revamped in then-US President Joe Biden's massive investment in clean technologies as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. To qualify for the $7,500 tax credit, a new EV had to have its final assembly in North America, and certain percentages of its battery content needed to be domestically sourced.Read full article Comments",

One of the most controversial is that Fallout 76 —the multiplayer take on Bethesda's rethink of a beloved '90s open-world computer roleplaying game—has been my favorite online multiplayer game since its launch. As much as I like the game, though, I've been surprised that it has actually grown over the past seven years. I'm not saying it's seen a full, No Man's Sky-like redemption story, though. It's still not for everyone, and in some ways, it has fallen behind the times since 2018. Nevertheless, the success of the streaming TV show based on the game franchise has attracted new players and given the developers a chance to seize the moment and attempt to complete a partial redemption story. To help make that happen, the game's developers will soon release an expansion fully capitalizing on that TV series for the first time, and I got to spend a few hours playing that update to see if it's any fun.Read full article Comments",

It’s largely used for simple tasks unrelated to commerce, like setting timers and checking the weather. As a result, Amazon’s Devices business has reportedly been siphoning money, and the clock is ticking for Alexa to prove its worth. Alexa+, a subscription-based generative AI service ($20 per month or included with Prime, which starts at $15/month), is supposed to solve Amazon's woes with Alexa.

They have active volcanoes, hydrocarbon oceans, geysers, and moon-wide oceans buried under icy crusts. And, as far as we can tell, the physics of the processes that produce large planets should make moon formation inevitable. Given how common planets are, our galaxy should be teeming with moons. Yet, despite some tantalizing hints, we've not found a clear indication of a moon orbiting an exoplanet. What we have found are a few very young exoplanets that appear to have moon-forming disks around them. Now, the James Webb Space Telescope has obtained a spectrum of the ring-forming disk around a giant super-Jupiter and found that it's rich in small carbon-based molecules. That's despite the fact that the star it's orbiting seems to have a planet-forming disk that's mostly water. Finding disks We search for exo-moons and moon-forming disks using completely different methods. To spot an actual moon, we rely on its gravitational influence. At some points in its orbit, it will be towing its planet forward to speed up its orbit; at others, it will be holding its planet back. This introduces subtle variations in the timing of when the planet arrives in front of the star from Earth's perspective.Read full article Comments",
