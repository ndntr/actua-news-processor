          "content": "Amazon’s October Prime Day sale (aka Prime Big Deal Days) is finally here, and we’ve collected the best deals we could find on everything from noise-canceling headphones and robot vacuums to 4K OLED TVs. The majority of our recommendations have been thoroughly tested by Verge writers and editors, and we are just as confident in our recommendations for a $25 Bluetooth speaker as we are in a $780 smartwatch. Some of these gadgets are available for less than they were during Amazon’s most recent Prime Day sale in July, so your patience has been rewarded if you sat the last one out. By that logic, it might be tempting to wait until Black Friday for an even better deal, but there’s no guarantee prices will drop further. Some gadgets may be in short supply come the holidays, and the impact of tariffs could lead to deal prices that don’t align with your expectations. So if you’re jumping in below, remember that you need an active Amazon Prime subscription. (Here’s a free 30-day trial if you don’t have one yet.)

However, they lack immersive audio mode and the higher-quality Bluetooth found in the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. Where to Buy: $359 $199 at Amazon $359 $199 at Best Buy $359.99 $199 at TargetSonos Ace The Sonos Ace are the company’s first set of wireless headphones. They feature a premium, comfortable build and active noise cancellation, along with compatibility with Sonos Arc and other Sonos soundbars. Read our review. Where to Buy: $399 $298.99 at Amazon $399 $299 at Best Buy $399 $299 at Sonos Bose’s Ultra Open Earbuds are back down to $199 ($100 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which matches their most recent Prime Day low. The earbuds clip onto the back of your ear instead of inside it, so you can still clearly hear what’s happening around you in addition to your music. You sacrifice bass in the process, but the design is particularly good for runners who want to remain aware of their surroundings. They’re also comfortable to wear, provide a secure fit during workouts, and offer solid battery life. Read our review. You can get Nothing’s Headphones 1 for a new low of $254 ($46 off) at Amazon. The newer headphones feature a 1980s Walkman-like look, with transparent ear cups that show the components underneath. Our reviewer found them to be less fatiguing to wear than Sony’s over-ear headphones, and their ANC was capable of blocking out subway noises and other city sounds. They don’t support multipoint pairing, sadly, so they can only be connected to one device at a time. You also can’t use its 3.5mm headphone jack if the headphones’ battery is dead. Read our review. The Galaxy Buds FE, which offer a pared-down experience compared to the step-up Buds 3 Pro, are matching their all-time low of $54.99 ($45 off) at Amazon. For the price, you get decent sound, a comfortable design, and noise cancellation that performs relatively well. They also offer around six hours of battery life with ANC enabled. That said, they lack several notable features, including wireless charging and multipoint support, and only carry an IPX2 rating. Read our review. AirPods 4 Apple’s AirPods 4 are the latest update to the company’s base-model wireless earbuds. The hard, plastic buds feature improved audio over the third-gen model, along with deep iOS integration and spatial audio with head tracking. Read our review. Where to Buy: $129 $89 at Amazon $129 $89 at WalmartBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones Bose’s headphones are a replacement for the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 and offer a more travel-friendly design, spatial audio, better call quality, excellent comfort, and some of the best noise cancellation around. Read our review. Where to Buy: $429 $284 at Amazon $429 $330 at Target $429 $329 at Best BuySony WH-1000XM6 Sony’s latest pair of flagship headphones feature improved comfort, better noise cancellation, and the ability to charge while in use. They even fold down for travel, which can’t be said about the last-gen XM5. Read our initial impressions. Where to Buy: $449.99 $428 at Amazon $449.99 $428 at Best Buy $449.99 $429.99 at Target (with Circle) We can still enthusiastically recommend Sony’s WH-1000XM5 for anyone in need of a pair for travel, and they’re currently on sale for $298 ($100 off) at Amazon. The headphones feature a slim design, two processors for handling active noise cancellation, eight microphones (four for voice calls), and 30 hours of battery life with ANC enabled. They also sound excellent, with lots of detail and tight bass. They don’t fold down, though, so keep that in mind if you travel or commute with a smaller backpack. Read our review. If you don’t like the sealed feeling of silicone ear tips, the AirPods 4 with ANC are a great alternative that are currently matching their all-time low of $119 ($60 off) at Amazon and Walmart. The wireless earbuds feature an open-ear design and some of the AirPods Pro’s best features, including adaptive audio, conversation awareness, and spatial audio with dynamic head tracking. Their ANC performs surprisingly well despite their open-style build, too, helping block low-frequency noise from airplane cabins and city traffic. Read our review. The Sennheiser IE 200 are on sale for $99.95 ($60 off) at Amazon, which is basically the same price we saw in July. Although the earbuds ditch Bluetooth for a more reliable wired connection, they still feature adjustable ear hooks and a detachable braided cable, which is easy to replace if it becomes worn out. A “dual-tunable” design also allows you to adjust the position of the ear tips, allowing you to fine-tune the sound profile depending on your preferences. The IE 200 don’t feature a built-in mic, though, which means they’re strictly for listening to music and podcasts. Read our review. Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 Significantly smaller and lighter than their predecessors, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 also offer stronger noise cancellation, a crystal clear transparency mode, and lengthy battery life. Read our review. Where to Buy: $229 $169.99 at Amazon $229 $189 at B&H Photo $229 $189 at Google StoreBose QuietComfort Earbuds (second-gen) Bose’s redesigned QuietComfort Earbuds deliver terrific active noise cancellation that outperforms most competitors. They also offer wireless charging and multipoint support right out of the box. Read hands-on impressions. Where to Buy: $179 $129 at Amazon $179 $129 at Best Buy $179 $129 at Bose The Skullcandy Method 360 ANC are on sale at Amazon $74.99 ($55 off), matching their previous all-time low. The newer earbuds use licensed technology and audio tuning by Bose, so they’re basically low-end Bose earbuds in disguise. That means you can expect a well-balanced sound, along with up to 40 hours of battery life, decent noise cancellation, and IPX4 water resistance. The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are on sale for $179.99 ($70 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which is similar to the price we saw during Amazon’s July Prime Day sale. Samsung’s flagship earbuds may not win any design awards, but they offer excellent sound quality, a crisp transparency mode, and useful hands-free voice support. While the earbuds offer decent sound and some great features, the active noise cancellation isn’t as robust as what you get from the AirPods Pro or Pixel Buds Pro 2. Read our review. Amazon Echo Buds (2023) Amazon’s newest Echo Buds lack noise cancellation but feature a semi-open design that should make it easier to remain aware of your surroundings. They also integrate with Alexa and support multipoint pairing. Where to Buy: $49.99 $14.99 at AmazonAirPods Max (USB-C) Apple&#8217;s AirPods Max offer a premium metal design, excellent noise cancellation, a crystal-clear transparency mode, and intuitive controls. They were upgraded with a USB-C port in 2024. Read our original review.

It supports charging speeds of up to 45W via a USB-C port and features a USB-A port, which is sufficient for topping off earbuds and other small gadgets. Where to Buy: $32.99 $27.99 at Amazon $32.99 $28.05 at INIU (with code TasteMe15)Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe Twelve South’s 3-in-1 charging stand offers full 15W MagSafe iPhone charging and can simultaneously top off a set of AirPods while fast-charging a compatible Apple Watch. It also includes a power supply (with travel adapters) to deliver enough juice over its 5-foot / 1.5m USB cable. Where to Buy: $149.99 $71.24 at Amazon $149.99 $74.99 at Twelve South $149.99 $71.24 at Best Buy If you don&#8217;t have an Apple Watch, Belkin’s MagSafe 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Stand is a great alternative to the charger above, one that’s currently matching its all-time low of $54.99 ($45 off) at Amazon. It also supports 15W magnetic charging and features a smaller wireless pad on its base, allowing you to charge a pair of wireless earbuds. The magnetic pad on the top is tilted at an angle, too, making it easy to check your iPhone’s screen at a glance or start a video call. Twelve South’s 50W PlugBug, which features a pair of USB-C ports, is down to $38.99 ($31 off) at Amazon, matching its best price to date. The charger’s built-in support for Apple’s Find My network makes it a particularly good choice if you travel frequently and want to ensure you don’t accidentally leave your charger behind at an airport or hotel room. It’s also relatively compact, featuring foldable prongs and a slim profile that makes it easy to slip into your bag. Belkin USB-C to USB-C Cable These braided USB-C cables from Belkin are durable and support 100W charging speeds, allowing for quick charging of laptops, tablets, smartphones, and portable game consoles. Where to Buy: $19.99 $11.99 at AmazonAnker Laptop Power Bank (25K, 165W, Built-in and Retractable Cables) Anker’s 25,000mAh power bank sports two retractable USB-C cables, plus one USB-C and USB-A port. It tops out at 165W when charging two devices simultaneously, or 130W when charging three or four. Where to Buy: $119.99 $89.99 at Amazon $119.99 $89.99 at Best Buy If you don’t mind toting around a slightly chunkier charger, Ugreen’s 100W Nexode Charger is another traveler-friendly option that’s marked down to $44.98 ($11 off) at Amazon. It’s outfitted with a 29.5-inch retractable cable — so you never have to worry about leaving your cord at home — along with two USB-C ports and a USB-A port, so you can charge up to three additional devices simultaneously. Ugreen Portable Charger (48K, 300W, 5-Port) Ugreen’s portable, 48,000mAh battery can charge a smartphone or tablet several times over; it also features an array of convenient ports and a nifty light strip on the side, which you can use during camping trips or anytime you power up your gadgets outside. Where to Buy: $169.99 $101.99 at Amazon $169.99 $101.99 at UgreenUgreen Uno Charger (65W, 3-Port) Ugreen’s 65W Uno charger features two USB-C ports and a single USB-A port, allowing you to charge three devices simultaneously. It also sports a quirky LED display that showcases different faces depending on the charging status. Where to Buy: $49.99 $32.99 at Amazon $49.99 $32.99 at Ugreen (Promo code: UL15570) Baseus’ Ultra-Slim Magnetic Power Bank, which is a cable-free way to charge your iPhone at up to 7.5W, is on sale at Amazon for $19.99 ($16 off), matching its all-time low. Its 20W USB-C port lets you take an iPhone’s battery from 0 to 55 percent in 30 minutes if you plug in using the included braided cable. Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 Jackery’s Explorer 1000 v2 can output up to 1,500W, which is enough to run a mini fridge or recharge a smartphone dozens of times.

It features a slim OLED display, offers up to three days of battery life, and can be easily detached from its band and clipped onto your clothes if you prefer not to wear it on your wrist. It can track your activity, heart rate, and sleep, though heart rate tracking is unavailable when it’s clipped on.

The Ace LTE lets a kid call or text a specified group of up to 20 contacts, while allowing parents to track their child’s location. However, you’ll need an active cellular subscription ($9.99 a month or $119.99 a year) to access calling, texting, and GPS functionality.

We found the Android watch to be comfortable and a solid all-around choice, thanks to its snappy performance. The single-day battery life was acceptable, although it can be extended by disabling the always-on display and GPS. Also, be aware that its sleep apnea tracking requires you to use it with a Samsung Galaxy smartphone. Read our review. CMF’s Watch Pro 2 is surprisingly robust for a smartwatch that’s on sale for $49 ($30 off) at Amazon. The watch touts an OLED display, GPS tracking, and 120 sports modes with automatic recognition for accurately tracking your workouts. The Watch Pro 2 can track your activity, sleep patterns, heart rate, and blood oxygen level, and sync fitness data to the Apple Health or Google Health Connect app. CMF says the battery lasts up to 11 days, too, so you won’t have to think about charging it every night.

          "content": "On Tuesday, three physicists received the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on quantum mechanics in the 1980s. Researchers John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis created a circuit with no electrical resistance to demonstrate a phenomenon known as quantum tunneling, or how atoms and subatomic particles can move through a barrier material they shouldn’t be able to cross. It was all theory before Clarke, Devoret, and Martinis created the circuit. But their experiments demonstrated tunneling is possible in a physical circuit, which later led to modern transistors and the nascent quantum computing industry. &#8220;I&#8217;m speaking on my cell phone and I suspect that you are too, and one of the underlying reasons that the cell phone works is because of all this work,&#8221; Clarke said in a phone call to reporters at the Nobel ceremony. He said he was “completely stunned” to receive the award, Reuters reported. Clarke led the team of researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, where he began his professorship in 1969 and remains an emeritus professor. Over the decades, the trio’s early work expanded to form the basis of modern quantum computers. Both Martinis and Devoret researched quantum computing at Google. In 2019, Martinis, then hardware lead of Google’s Quantum AI team, and other researchers declared the creation of a computer with “quantum supremacy” far faster at solving a problem than the fastest supercomputer. He left the role at Google but is still a professor at Yale University and the University of California, Santa Barbara. Devoret is the chief scientist of quantum hardware at Google Quantum AI and a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The trio joins the rarified group of physicists worldwide to earn the highest scientific prize, including Max Planck in 1918 and Albert Einstein in 1921. Correction, October 7th: An earlier version of this article misstated the day the awards were announced. It was Tuesday, not Thursday.",

The presentation ceremony will take place in Stockholm on December 10, 2025. \"To put it mildly, it was the surprise of my life,\" Clarke told reporters by phone during this morning's press conference. \"Our discovery in some ways is the basis of quantum computing. Exactly at this moment where this fits in is not entirely clear to me. One of the underlying reasons that cellphones work is because of all this work.\" When physicists began delving into the strange new realm of subatomic particles in the early 20th century, they discovered a realm where the old, deterministic laws of classical physics no longer apply. Instead, uncertainty reigns supreme. It is a world governed not by absolutes, but by probabilities, where events that would seem impossible on the macroscale occur on a regular basis.Read full article Comments",

Launching in more countries is “by far our number one request,” though the AltStore team is still waiting to hear more from Apple “on exact timing.” Testut also says that AltStore is making a big push into the fediverse by using the ActivityPub protocol to “federate apps, app updates, and news alerts from AltStore to the open social web.” Here’s how that will work, according to Testut: Each AltStore source will receive its own ActivityPub account, which can then be followed by any other open social web account. You’ll be able to like, boost, and reply to everything, and most importantly all these interactions will appear natively in AltStore. In other words, you’ll be able to comment on an app on Mastodon, like a news update on Threads, then open AltStore and view all these same interactions in-app. The AltStore team is working with Mastodon gGmbH to “manage a custom Mastodon server on our behalf” (it’s available in beta now) and with the non-profit A New Social to support Bluesky using the Bridgy Fed tool. The fediverse features will come to AltStore PAL in “the next few months,” Testut says. AltStore is also getting a $6 million investment from Patreon board member Chris Paik’s Pace Capital so the team can hire more staff and add “the necessary bandwidth to finalize Fediverse integration and expand AltStore worldwide,” Testut says. Paik will join AltStore’s board of directors, as will Flipboard CEO Mike McCue, who is a big fan of the fediverse.",

The model, called Gemini 2.5 Computer Use, uses “visual understanding and reasoning capabilities” to analyze a user’s request and carry out a task, such as filling out and submitting a form. It can be used for UI testing or navigating interfaces made for people who don&#8217;t have an API or other direct connection available. Other versions of this model have been used for agentic features in AI Mode and Project Mariner, a research prototype that uses AI agents to carry out tasks on its own in a browser, like adding items to your cart based on a list of ingredients. Google’s announcement comes just one day after OpenAI revealed new apps for ChatGPT as part of its annual Dev Day, and continues to focus its attention on its ChatGPT Agent feature that can complete complex tasks on your behalf. Meanwhile, Anthropic had already released a version of its Claude AI model with “computer use” last year. Google posted some demo videos showing its computer use tool in action, and notes that they are sped up 3x. Google says its computer use model “outperforms leading alternatives on multiple web and mobile benchmarks.” Unlike ChatGPT Agent and Anthropic’s computer use tool, Google’s new AI model only has access to a browser — not an entire computer environment. Google notes that it shows “it is not yet optimized for desktop OS-level control” and currently supports 13 actions, including opening a web browser, typing text, as well as dragging and dropping elements. Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is available to developers through Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, but there’s also a demo on Browserbase, where you watch as it completes tasks, like “Play a game of 2048” or “Browse Hacker News for trending debates.”",

Tesla fans have long-awaited a cheaper entry-level model; this was supposed to be the $25,000 Model 2. But the development of that electric vehicle was shelved earlier last year as CEO Elon Musk began to lose interest with car-making in favor of humanoid robots. However, car sales still make up the overwhelming majority of Tesla's revenue, and the removal of the IRS clean vehicle tax credit at the end of September may have juiced US EV sales in Q3 2025, but sales are expected to dip significantly in the current quarter. The new Standard Range Model Y starts at $39,990, with 321 miles (516 km) of range from its rear-wheel drive powertrain, compared to the now-Premium rear-wheel drive Model Y, which has an EPA range of 357 miles (574 km). In the past, Tesla has software-locked batteries to a smaller configuration; however, here we believe the Standard Range Model Y uses a 69 kWh pack.Read full article Comments",

Examples of celebrities being posthumously inserted into Sora 2 video creations are not hard to find all over social media these days. Tupac Shakur chatting with Malcolm X. Bruce Lee running a \"dragon energy\" DJ set. Michael Jackson doing kitchen-based standup comedy. Stephen Hawking's wheelchair wiping out on a giant skateboard ramp. Mister Rogers doing a cameo on Jackass. Kurt Cobain stealing KFC chicken fingers. Martin Luther King Jr. stuttering through a major speech. The list goes on and on. OpenAI places a moving Sora watermark over each generated video, which limits the risk of viewers being fooled by fake footage of real people.

The company asked the US Supreme Court to freeze parts of the Play Store antitrust ruling while it pursued an appeal, but the high court has rejected that petition. That means the first elements of the antitrust remedies won by Epic Games will have to be implemented in mere weeks. The app store case is one of three ongoing antitrust actions against Google, but it's the furthest along of them. Google lost the case in 2023, and in 2024, US District Judge James Donato ordered a raft of sweeping changes aimed at breaking Google's illegal monopoly on Android app distribution. In July, Google lost its initial appeal, leaving it with little time before the mandated changes must begin. Its petition to the Supreme Court was Google's final Hail Mary to avoid opening the Play Store even a crack. Google asked the justices to pause remedies pending its appeal, but the court has declined to do so, Reuters reports. Hopefully, Google planned for this eventuality because it must implement the first phase of the remedies by October 22.Read full article Comments",

But some users on Reddit and elsewhere objected to Apple's wholesale removal of the old multitasking mode, Split View (which allowed two apps onscreen at a time with a handle for adjusting the amount of screen they took up) and Slide Over (which allowed a small window to be swiped over top of your screen and then quickly dismissed when you were done with it). Split View was reasonably easy to recreate with the new system, but users who had relied on Slide Over bemoaned the lack of an equivalent feature in iPadOS 26. Apple apparently agrees because the second developer beta of the upcoming iPadOS 26.1 adds Slide Over support back into the operating system (as reported by MacRumors). Like the old Slide Over window, the new one sits on top of all your other apps and can be invoked and dismissed whenever you want.Read full article Comments",

The SDK is built on the open source Model Context Protocol (MCP), Altman said. That means developers that already use MCP only need to add an HTML resource to enable ChatGPT integration, he added. The new integration means a ChatGPT user can directly ask Figma to turn a sketch into a diagram, for instance, and get results integrated into their ChatGPT conversation. It also means that ChatGPT can suggest apps that might be suited to a more general query, like recommending and creating a Spotify playlist when someone asks for song suggestions.Read full article Comments",

Those specialized cells—regulatory T cells—are now well established as playing a key role in peripheral immune tolerance. That is, a non-central process that allows the immune system to strike a delicate balance between being appropriately responsive and aggressive toward intruding germs or foreign dangers while also not running amok. Before the trio of prize winners came along, researchers thought that such immune tolerance occurred centrally, in the thymus, the primary lymphoid organ that sits in the center of the chest. There, T cells mature, including into two key types: T helper cells, which go on to trigger immune responses when they recognize foreign dangers; and the aptly named T killer cells, which kill cells, including foreign cells, cancer cells, and cells infected by a virus.Read full article Comments",

Shin is the first author of a new study in Nature Neuroscience that has identified a specific population of neurons in the visual cortex—dubbed IC-encoders—and shows their direct role in representing a visual illusion. The work is the result of a collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley, the Allen Institute in Seattle, and Seoul National University. What the brain “knows” Illusory contours are edges we see even though they aren’t physically there. A classic example is the Kanizsa triangle: three “Pac-Man” shapes make us perceive a bright white triangle floating on top. Hide the Pac-Men with your fingers and the trick is revealed: There is no border, just a uniform background. Neurophysiology agrees with perception here: For over 20 years, studies in primates and later imaging in humans and mice have described neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas that respond to real and illusory contours.

At night, the brilliant white ribbon of racetrack throws the rest of the surroundings into darkness. Unlike a Le Mans car, there are no headlights in F1. Just over 1,600 lights are needed for the job, which got underway in mid-June. They're LED now, a switch made in 2023 that cut energy consumption by a noticeable 30 percent. The light itself is even carefully tuned—a color of 5,700 K and a color rendering index of 90 best replicate daylight for the drivers. Oh, and there can't be any flickering that could affect the TV broadcast. The results look spectacular, especially in 4K. As for the racing this year? Perhaps not so much. Past Singaporean Grands Prix have tended to be action-packed—or even chaotic. In the inaugural 2008 race, Red Bull came away convinced that electromagnetic interference from an underground train line caused the failure of one of its race cars, as well as a sister car belonging to the team we now call Racing Bulls.
