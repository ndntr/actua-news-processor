Two weeks later, OpenAI announced it would start predicting users' ages to improve safety more broadly. Then, this week, OpenAI introduced parental controls for ChatGPT and its video generator Sora 2. Those controls allow parents to limit their teens' use and even get access to information about chat logs in \"rare cases\" where OpenAI's \"system and trained reviewers detect possible signs of serious safety risk.\"Read full article Comments",

They have active volcanoes, hydrocarbon oceans, geysers, and moon-wide oceans buried under icy crusts. And, as far as we can tell, the physics of the processes that produce large planets should make moon formation inevitable. Given how common planets are, our galaxy should be teeming with moons. Yet, despite some tantalizing hints, we've not found a clear indication of a moon orbiting an exoplanet. What we have found are a few very young exoplanets that appear to have moon-forming disks around them. Now, the James Webb Space Telescope has obtained a spectrum of the ring-forming disk around a giant super-Jupiter, and found that it's rich in small carbon-based molecules. That's despite the fact that the star it's orbiting seems to have a planet-forming disk that's mostly water. Finding disks We search for exo-moons and moon-forming disks using completely different methods. To spot an actual moon, we rely on its gravitational influence. At some points in its orbit, it will be towing its planet forward to speed up its orbit; at others, it will be holding its planet back. This introduces subtle variations in the timing of when the planet arrives in front of the star from Earth's perspective.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "In the age of cloud computing, protections baked into chips from Intel, AMD, and others are essential for ensuring confidential data and sensitive operations can’t be viewed or manipulated by attackers who manage to compromise servers running inside a data center. In many cases, these protections—which work by storing certain data and processes inside encrypted enclaves known as TEEs (Trusted Execution Enclaves)—are essential for safeguarding secrets stored in the cloud by the likes of Signal Messenger and WhatsApp. All major cloud providers recommend that customers use it. Intel calls its protection SGX, and AMD has named it SEV-SNP. Over the years, researchers have repeatedly broken the security and privacy promises that Intel and AMD have made about their respective protections. On Tuesday, researchers independently published two papers laying out separate attacks that further demonstrate the limitations of SGX and SEV-SNP. One attack, dubbed Battering RAM, defeats both protections and allows attackers to not only view encrypted data but also to actively manipulate it to introduce software backdoors or to corrupt data. A separate attack known as Wiretap is able to passively decrypt sensitive data protected by SGX and remain invisible at all times. Attacking deterministic encryption Both attacks use a small piece of hardware, known as an interposer, that sits between CPU silicon and the memory module. Its position allows the interposer to observe data as it passes from one to the other. They exploit both Intel’s and AMD’s use of deterministic encryption, which produces the same ciphertext each time the same plaintext is encrypted with a given key. In SGX and SEV-SNP, that means the same plaintext written to the same memory address always produces the same ciphertext.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Ever wonder why ChatGPT slows down during long conversations? The culprit is a fundamental mathematical challenge: processing long sequences of text requires massive computational resources, even with the efficiency tricks that companies have already deployed. While US tech giants can afford to throw more hardware at the problem, Chinese AI company DeepSeek, which is cut off from a steady supply of some advanced AI chips by export restrictions, has extra motivation to squeeze more performance from less silicon. On Monday, DeepSeek released an experimental version of its latest simulated reasoning language model, DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp, which introduces what it calls \"DeepSeek Sparse Attention\" (DSA). It's the company's implementation of a computational technique likely already used in some of the world's most prominent AI models. OpenAI pioneered sparse transformers in 2019 and used the technique to build GPT-3, while Google Research published work on \"Reformer\" models using similar concepts in 2020. (The full extent to which Western AI companies currently use sparse attention in their latest models remains undisclosed.) Despite sparse attention being a known approach for years, DeepSeek claims its version achieves \"fine-grained sparse attention for the first time\" and has cut API prices by 50 percent to demonstrate the efficiency gains. But to understand more about what makes DeepSeek v3.2 notable, it's useful to refresh yourself on a little AI history.Read full article Comments",

Russian YouTube channel Wylsacom has posted an unboxing video and early tour of what appears to be a retail boxed version of a new 256GB 13-inch iPad Pro, as well as an M5 processor that we haven't seen in any other Apple product yet. This would be the first new iPad Pro since May 2024, when Apple introduced the current M4 version. The same channel also got hold of the M4 MacBook Pro early, so it seems likely that this is genuine. And while the video is mostly dedicated to complaining about packaging, the wattage of the included power adapter, and how boring it is that Apple doesn't introduce dramatic design changes every generation, it does also give us some early performance numbers for the new M5.Read full article Comments",

The legislation, S.B. 53, replaces Senator Scott Wiener's previous attempt at AI regulation, known as S.B. 1047, that would have required safety testing and \"kill switches\" for AI systems. Instead, the new law asks companies to describe how they incorporate \"national standards, international standards, and industry-consensus best practices\" into their AI development, without specifying what those standards are or requiring independent verification. \"California has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive,\" Newsom said in a statement, though the law's actual protective measures remain largely voluntary beyond basic reporting requirements.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "To trap its prey, the Venus flytrap sends rapid electrical impulses, which are generated in response to touch or stress. But the molecular identity of the touch sensor has remained unclear. Japanese scientists have identified the molecular mechanism that triggers that response and have published their work in a new paper in the journal Nature Communications. As previously reported, the Venus flytrap attracts its prey with a pleasing fruity scent. When an insect lands on a leaf, it stimulates the highly sensitive trigger hairs that line the leaf. When the pressure becomes strong enough to bend those hairs, the plant will snap its leaves shut and trap the insect inside. Long cilia grab and hold the insect in place, much like fingers, as the plant begins to secrete digestive juices. The insect is digested slowly over five to 12 days, after which the trap reopens, releasing the dried-out husk of the insect into the wind. In 2016, Rainer Hedrich, a biophysicist at Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg in Bavaria, Germany, led the team that discovered that the Venus flytrap could actually \"count\" the number of times something touches its hair-lined leaves—an ability that helps the plant distinguish between the presence of prey and a small nut or stone, or even a dead insect. The plant detects the first \"action potential\" but doesn't snap shut right away, waiting until a second zap confirms the presence of actual prey, at which point the trap closes. But the Venus flytrap doesn't close all the way and produce digestive enzymes to consume the prey until the hairs are triggered three more times (for a total of five stimuli).Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Subaru provided flights from Los Angeles to Portland, Oregon, and accommodation so Ars could drive the new Crosstrek. Ars does not accept paid editorial content. Even at a brief glance, the Subaru Crosstrek clearly prioritizes rugged design and personality over any semblance of aerodynamic efficiency. Subaru’s best-seller also comes only in all-wheel drive, to stay true to customer expectations of all-weather confidence and the appeal of an aspirational adventure lifestyle. And yet, the latest-generation Crosstrek’s new hybrid variant improves power and torque output significantly, while simultaneously resulting in the most efficient Crosstrek to date. Any consideration of aerodynamic improvements for this generation can best be thought of as minor. And yet, the wheel well vents do reduce turbulence and pressure while more cleanly skirting air around the side panels. And some mild smoothing versus the previous generations include tiny elements like the forward-facing edge of the roof rail mounts. However, reduced plastic cladding on the hybrid Crosstreks that might seem intended to improve airflow counterintuitively came about only because Subaru builds the hybrids in Japan for all international markets, and only Americans prefer going overboard on tacky plastic trim pieces. More importantly than aero, the Crosstrek now shares a hybrid powertrain with the Forester SUV. If a naturally aspirated 2.5 L horizontally opposed Boxer four-cylinder engine sounds familiar from Subarus over the past four decades, in reality, this hybrid system significantly works over the flat-four versus even current internal-combustion siblings. This year introduces a host of mechanical modifications to the cylinder head, block, camshaft, crank pulley, fuel system, intake, exhaust, cooling, and more. But more importantly, the engine now runs on an Atkinson cycle, which holds the intake valves open longer to reduce piston resistance during the expansion stroke, resulting in reduced power output but improved fuel efficiency.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "On Monday, Anthropic released Claude Sonnet 4.5, a new AI language model the company calls its \"most capable model to date,\" with improved coding and computer use capabilities. The company also revealed Claude Code 2.0, a command-line AI agent for developers, and the Claude Agent SDK, which is a tool developers can use to build their own AI coding agents. Anthropic says it has witnessed Sonnet 4.5 working continuously on the same project \"for more than 30 hours on complex, multi-step tasks,\" though the company did not provide specific details about the tasks. In the past, agentic models have been known to typically lose coherence over long periods of time as errors accumulate and context windows (a type of short-term memory for the model) fill up. In the past, Anthropic has mentioned that previous Claude 4.0 models have played Pokémon for over 24 hours or refactored code for seven hours. To understand why Sonnet exists, you need to know a bit about how AI language models work. Traditionally, Anthropic has produced three differently sized AI models in the Claude family: Haiku (the smallest), Sonnet (mid-range), and Opus (the largest). Anthropic last updated Haiku in November 2024 (to 3.5), Sonnet this past May (to 4.0), and Opus in August (to 4.1). Model size in parameters, which are values stored in its neural network, is roughly proportional to overall contextual depth (the number of multidimensional connections between concepts, which you might call \"knowledge\") and better problem-solving capability, but larger models are also slower and more expensive to run. So AI companies always seek a sweet spot in the middle with reasonable performance-cost trade-offs. Claude Sonnet has filled that role for Anthropic quite well for two years now.Read full article Comments",

LEIPZIG, Germany—Porsche is synonymous with sports cars in which the engine lives behind the driver. From the company's first open-top 356/1—which it let us drive a couple of years ago—to the latest stupendously clever 911 variants, these are the machines most of us associate with the Stuttgart-based brand. And indeed, the company has sold more than a million 911s since the model's introduction in 1963. But here's the bald truth: It's the SUVs that keep the lights on. Without their profit, there would be no money to develop the next T-Hybrid or GT3. The first Cayenne was introduced just 23 years ago; since then, Porsche has sold more than 1.5 million of them. And the next one will be electric. Of course, this won't be Porsche's first electric SUV. That honor goes to the electric Macan, which is probably becoming a more common sight on the streets in more well-heeled neighborhoods. Like the Macan, the Cayenne Electric is based on Volkswagen Group's Premium Platform Electric, but this is no mere scaled-up Macan. \"It's not just a product update; it's a complete new chapter in the story,\" said Sajjad Khan, a member of Porsche's management board in charge of car IT.Read full article Comments",

By the time you read this, the World Endurance Championship will be 100 races old. Once centered on the mega-expensive, mega-fast LMP1 hybrids, it's all about the Hypercars now. These are purpose-built, closed-top race cars, with some of the most complex hybrid systems you'll find outside of Formula 1, clad in bodywork that could give the Batmobile a run for its money. These Hypercars are designed to last the distance. During the 24 hours of Le Mans this year, the winning car covered 3,276 miles (5,273 km); for context, an F1 race is usually 190 miles (305 km), and at Monza this year, the race lasted little more than an hour. Here's another difference with F1: When it comes to endurance racing, Ferrari has been winning a lot. In fact, it's taken victory at Le Mans for three years in a row, scoring a hat trick after 50 years away from this corner of the sport. This year has been even better: Ferrari leads the manufacturer's championship and the driver's championship with the #51 factory car. Its closest rival for the driver's title is another 83 Ferrari, this one entered as a privateer car by the AF Corsa team. When the invite arrived to join the team for its race at the Circuit of the Americas in Texas, it seemed like a perfect opportunity to watch it in action and find out the key to that success. \"It has been an amazing challenge for us because after 50 years, it was not simple to restart in the pinnacle of motorsport,\" said Antonello Coletta, head of Ferrari's endurance racing program. Eighteen months after the car was greenlit, it was racing at Sebring in early 2023, a notoriously bumpy WWII bomber base in Florida that is as hard a test on a race car as any. Later that year, the 499P won Le Mans on its first try.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "A fossil skull from China that made headlines last week may or may not be a million years old, but it's probably closely related to Denisovans. The fossil skull, dubbed Yunxian 2, is one of three unearthed from a terrace alongside the Han River, in central China, in a layer of river sediment somewhere between 600,000 and 1 million years old. Archaeologists originally identified them as Homo erectus, but Hanjiang Normal University paleoanthropologist Xiaobo Feng and his colleagues’ recent digital reconstruction of Yunxian 2 suggests the skulls may actually have belonged to someone a lot more similar to us: a hominin group defined as a species called Homo longi or a Denisovan, depending on who’s doing the naming. The recent paper adds fuel—and a new twist—to that debate. And the whole thing may hinge on a third skull from the same site, still waiting to be published.Read full article Comments",
