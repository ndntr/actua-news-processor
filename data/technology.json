          "standfirst": "OpenAI on Wednesday released GPT-5.3-Codex, which the company calls its most capable coding agent to date, in an announcement timed to land at the exact same moment Anthropic unveiled its own flagship model upgrade, Claude Opus 4.6. The synchronized launches mark the opening salvo in what industry observers are calling the AI coding wars — a high-stakes battle to capture the enterprise software development market.The dueling announcements came amid an already heated week between the two AI giants, who are also set to air competing Super Bowl advertisements on Sunday, and whose executives have been trading barbs publicly over business models, access, and corporate ethics.\"I love building with this model; it feels like more of a step forward than the benchmarks suggest,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X minutes after the launch. He later added: \"It was amazing to watch how much faster we were able to ship 5.3-Codex by using 5.3-Codex, and for sure this is a sign of things to come.\"That claim — that the model helped build itself — is a significant milestone in AI development. According to OpenAI&#x27;s announcement, the Codex team used early versions of GPT-5.3-Codex to debug its own training runs, manage deployment infrastructure, and diagnose test results and evaluations. The company describes it as \"our first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\"OpenAI&#x27;s new coding model posts record-breaking benchmark scores, outpacing Anthropic&#x27;s Claude by double digitsThe new model posts substantial gains across multiple industry benchmarks. GPT-5.3-Codex achieves 57% on SWE-Bench Pro, a rigorous evaluation of real-world software engineering that spans four programming languages and tests contamination-resistant, industrially relevant challenges. It scores 77.3% on Terminal-Bench 2.0, which measures the terminal skills essential for coding agents, and 64% on OSWorld, an agentic computer-use benchmark where models must complete productivity tasks in visual desktop environments.The Terminal-Bench 2.0 result is particularly striking. According to performance data released Wednesday, GPT-5.3-Codex scored 77.3% compared to GPT-5.2-Codex&#x27;s 64.0% and the base GPT-5.2 model&#x27;s 62.2% — a 13-percentage-point leap in a single generation. One user on X noted that the score \"absolutely demolished\" Anthropic&#x27;s Opus 4.6, which reportedly achieved 65.4% on the same benchmark.OpenAI also claims the model accomplishes these results with dramatically improved efficiency: less than half the tokens of its predecessor for equivalent tasks, plus more than 25% faster inference per token.\"Notably, GPT-5.3-Codex does so with fewer tokens than any prior model, letting users simply build more,\" the company stated in its announcement.From coding assistant to computer operator: GPT-5.3-Codex aims to automate the entire software development lifecyclePerhaps more significant than the benchmark improvements is OpenAI&#x27;s positioning of GPT-5.3-Codex as a model that transcends pure coding. The company explicitly states that \"Codex goes from an agent that can write and review code to an agent that can do nearly anything developers and professionals can do on a computer.\"This expanded capability set includes debugging, deploying, monitoring, writing product requirement documents, editing copy, conducting user research, building slide decks, and analyzing data in spreadsheet applications. The model shows strong performance on GDPVal, an OpenAI evaluation released in 2025 that measures performance on well-specified knowledge-work tasks across 44 occupations.The expansion signals OpenAI&#x27;s ambition to capture not just the developer tools market but the broader enterprise productivity software space — a market that includes established players like Microsoft, Salesforce, and ServiceNow, all of whom are racing to embed AI agents into their platforms.OpenAI&#x27;s first &#x27;high capability&#x27; cybersecurity model prompts new safety protocols and a $10 million defense fundThe pivot toward general-purpose computing brings new security considerations. In a notable disclosure, OpenAI revealed that GPT-5.3-Codex is the first model it classifies as \"High capability\" for cybersecurity-related tasks under its Preparedness Framework, and the first directly trained to identify software vulnerabilities.\"While we don&#x27;t have definitive evidence it can automate cyber attacks end-to-end, we&#x27;re taking a precautionary approach and deploying our most comprehensive cybersecurity safety stack to date,\" the company stated. Mitigations include dual-use safety training, automated monitoring, trusted access for advanced capabilities, and enforcement pipelines incorporating threat intelligence.Altman highlighted this development on X: \"This is our first model that hits &#x27;high&#x27; for cybersecurity on our preparedness framework. We are piloting a Trusted Access framework, and committing $10 million in API credits to accelerate cyber defense.\"The company is also expanding the private beta of Aardvark, its security research agent, and partnering with open-source maintainers to provide free codebase scanning for widely used projects. OpenAI cited Next.js as an example where a security researcher used Codex to discover vulnerabilities disclosed last week.Super Bowl showdown: Sam Altman calls Anthropic&#x27;s advertising campaign &#x27;clearly dishonest&#x27; as rivalry turns personalThe cybersecurity announcement, however, has been overshadowed by the increasingly personal nature of the OpenAI-Anthropic rivalry. The timing of Wednesday&#x27;s release cannot be understood without the context of OpenAI&#x27;s intensifying competition with Anthropic, the AI safety-focused startup founded in 2021 by former OpenAI researchers, including Dario and Daniela Amodei.Both companies scheduled major product announcements for 10 a.m. Pacific Time today. Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4.6, which it describes as its \"smartest model\" that \"plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, operates reliably in massive codebases, and catches its own mistakes.”The head-to-head timing follows a week of escalating tensions. Anthropic announced it will air Super Bowl advertisements mocking OpenAI&#x27;s recent decision to begin testing ads within ChatGPT for free users. Altman responded with unusual directness, calling the advertisements \"funny\" but \"clearly dishonest\" in an extensive X post.\"We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that,\" Altman wrote. \"I guess it&#x27;s on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren&#x27;t real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.\"He went further, characterizing Anthropic as an \"authoritarian company\" that \"wants to control what people do with AI.\"\"Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people,\" Altman wrote. \"More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do.\"Enterprise AI spending surges past projections as OpenAI&#x27;s market share faces pressure from Anthropic and GoogleThe public sparring masks a deadly serious business competition. The rivalry plays out against a backdrop of explosive enterprise AI adoption, where both companies are fighting for position in a rapidly expanding market.According to survey data from Andreessen Horowitz released this week, enterprise spending on large language models has dramatically outpaced even bullish projections. Average enterprise LLM spending reached $7 million in 2025, 180% higher than 2024&#x27;s actual spending of $2.5 million — and 56% above what enterprises had projected for 2025 just a year earlier. Spending is projected to reach $11.6 million per enterprise in 2026, a further 65% increase.The a16z data reveals shifting market dynamics that help explain the intensity of the competition. OpenAI maintains the largest average share of enterprise AI wallet, but that share is shrinking — from 62% in 2024 to a projected 53% in 2026. Anthropic&#x27;s share, meanwhile, has grown from 14% to a projected 18% over the same period, with Google showing similar gains.Enterprise adoption patterns tell a more nuanced story. While OpenAI leads in overall usage, only 46% of surveyed OpenAI customers are using its most capable models in production, compared to 75% for Anthropic and 76% for Google. When including testing environments, 89% of Anthropic customers are testing or using the company&#x27;s most capable models — the highest rate among major providers.For software development specifically — one of the primary use cases for both companies&#x27; coding agents — the a16z survey shows OpenAI with approximately 35% market share, with Anthropic claiming a substantial and growing portion of the remainder.Both AI labs race to become the enterprise operating system of choice, moving beyond models to full-stack platformsThese market dynamics explain why both companies are positioning themselves as platforms rather than mere model providers. OpenAI on Wednesday also launched Frontier, a new platform designed to serve as a comprehensive hub for businesses adopting a range of AI tools — including those developed by third parties — that can operate together seamlessly.\"We can be the partner of choice for AI transformation for enterprise. The sky is the limit in terms of revenue we can generate from a platform like that,\" Fidji Simo, OpenAI&#x27;s CEO of applications, told reporters this week.This follows Monday&#x27;s launch of the Codex desktop application for macOS, which OpenAI says has already surpassed 500,000 downloads. The app enables users to manage multiple AI coding agents simultaneously — a capability that becomes increasingly important as enterprises deploy agents for complex, long-running tasks.Trillion-dollar compute obligations and $350 billion valuations reveal the massive financial stakes driving the AI coding raceThe platform ambitions require extraordinary capital. The dueling launches underscore the staggering financial requirements of frontier AI development, with both companies burning through billions while racing to establish market dominance.Anthropic is currently in discussions for a funding round that could bring in more than $20 billion at a valuation of at least $350 billion, according to Bloomberg, and is simultaneously planning an employee tender offer at that valuation.OpenAI, meanwhile, has disclosed that it owes more than $1 trillion in financial obligations to backers — including Oracle, Microsoft, and Nvidia — that are essentially fronting compute costs in expectation of future returns.GPT-5.3-Codex was \"co-designed for, trained with, and served on NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems,\" according to OpenAI&#x27;s announcement—a reference to Nvidia&#x27;s latest Blackwell-generation AI supercomputing architecture.The financial pressure adds urgency to both companies&#x27; enterprise strategies. Unlike established tech giants with diversified revenue streams, both Anthropic and OpenAI must prove they can generate sufficient revenue from AI products to justify their extraordinary valuations and infrastructure costs.OpenAI promises more Codex features in coming weeks as 500,000 users download the new desktop appLooking ahead, OpenAI says GPT-5.3-Codex is available immediately for paid ChatGPT users across all Codex surfaces: the desktop app, command-line interface, IDE extensions, and web interface. API access is expected to follow.The model includes a new interactivity feature: users can choose between \"pragmatic\" or \"friendly\" personalities — a customization Altman suggests users feel strongly about. More substantively, the model provides frequent progress updates during tasks, allowing users to interact in real time, ask questions, discuss approaches, and steer toward solutions without losing context.\"Instead of waiting for a final output, you can interact in real time,\" OpenAI stated. \"GPT-5.3-Codex talks through what it&#x27;s doing, responds to feedback, and keeps you in the loop from start to finish.\"The company promises more capabilities in the coming weeks, with Altman declaring: \"I believe Codex is going to win.\"He concluded his response to Anthropic with a philosophical statement that frames the competition in stark terms: \"This time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them.\"Whether that message resonates with enterprise customers — who according to a16z data cite trust, security, and compliance as their top concerns — remains to be seen. What&#x27;s clear is that the AI coding wars have begun in earnest, and neither company intends to cede ground.",

          "standfirst": "Anthropic on Thursday released Claude Opus 4.6, a major upgrade to its flagship artificial intelligence model that the company says plans more carefully, sustains longer autonomous workflows, and outperforms competitors including OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.2 on key enterprise benchmarks — a release that arrives at a tumultuous moment for the AI industry and global software markets.The launch comes just three days after OpenAI released its own Codex desktop application in a direct challenge to Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Code momentum, and amid a $285 billion rout in software and services stocks that investors attribute partly to fears that Anthropic&#x27;s AI tools could disrupt established enterprise software businesses.For the first time, Anthropic&#x27;s Opus-class models will feature a 1 million token context window, allowing the AI to process and reason across vastly more information than previous versions. The company also introduced \"agent teams\" in Claude Code — a research preview feature that enables multiple AI agents to work simultaneously on different aspects of a coding project, coordinating autonomously.\"We&#x27;re focused on building the most capable, reliable, and safe AI systems,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told VentureBeat about the announcements. \"Opus 4.6 is even better at planning, helping solve the most complex coding tasks. And the new agent teams feature means users can split work across multiple agents — one on the frontend, one on the API, one on the migration — each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others.\"Why OpenAI and Anthropic are locked in an all-out war for enterprise developersThe release intensifies an already fierce competition between Anthropic and OpenAI, the two most valuable privately held AI companies in the world. OpenAI on Monday released a new desktop application for its Codex artificial intelligence coding system, a tool the company says transforms software development from a collaborative exercise with a single AI assistant into something more akin to managing a team of autonomous workers.AI coding assistants have exploded in popularity over the last year, and OpenAI said more than 1 million developers have used Codex in the past month. The new Codex app is part of OpenAI&#x27;s ongoing effort to lure users and market share away from rivals like Anthropic and Cursor.The timing of Anthropic&#x27;s release — just 72 hours after OpenAI&#x27;s Codex launch — underscores the breakneck pace of competition in AI development tools. OpenAI faces intensifying competition from Anthropic, which posted the largest share increase of any frontier lab since May 2025, according to a recent Andreessen Horowitz survey. Forty-four percent of enterprises now use Anthropic in production, driven by rapid capability gains in software development since late 2024. The desktop launch is a strategic counter to Claude Code&#x27;s momentum.According to Anthropic&#x27;s announcement, Opus 4.6 achieves the highest score on Terminal-Bench 2.0, an agentic coding evaluation, and leads all other frontier models on Humanity&#x27;s Last Exam, a complex multi-discipline reasoning test. On GDPval-AA — a benchmark measuring performance on economically valuable knowledge work tasks in finance, legal and other domains — Opus 4.6 outperforms OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.2 by approximately 144 ELO points, which translates to obtaining a higher score approximately 70% of the time.Inside Claude Code&#x27;s $1 billion revenue milestone and growing enterprise footprintThe stakes are substantial. Asked about Claude Code&#x27;s financial performance, the Anthropic spokesperson noted that in November, the company announced that Claude Code reached $1 billion in run rate revenue only six months after becoming generally available in May 2025.The spokesperson highlighted major enterprise deployments: \"Claude Code is used by Uber across teams like software engineering, data science, finance, and trust and safety; wall-to-wall deployment across Salesforce&#x27;s global engineering org; tens of thousands of devs at Accenture; and companies across industries like Spotify, Rakuten, Snowflake, Novo Nordisk, and Ramp.\"That enterprise traction has translated into skyrocketing valuations. Earlier this month, Anthropic signed a term sheet for a $10 billion funding round at a $350 billion valuation. Bloomberg reported that Anthropic is simultaneously working on a tender offer that would allow employees to sell shares at that valuation, offering liquidity to staffers who have watched the company&#x27;s worth multiply since its 2021 founding.How Opus 4.6 solves the &#x27;context rot&#x27; problem that has plagued AI modelsOne of Opus 4.6&#x27;s most significant technical improvements addresses what the AI industry calls \"context rot\"—the degradation of model performance as conversations grow longer. Anthropic says Opus 4.6 scores 76% on MRCR v2, a needle-in-a-haystack benchmark testing a model&#x27;s ability to retrieve information hidden in vast amounts of text, compared to just 18.5% for Sonnet 4.5.\"This is a qualitative shift in how much context a model can actually use while maintaining peak performance,\" the company said in its announcement.The model also supports outputs of up to 128,000 tokens — enough to complete substantial coding tasks or documents without breaking them into multiple requests.For developers, Anthropic is introducing several new API features alongside the model: adaptive thinking, which allows Claude to decide when deeper reasoning would be helpful rather than requiring a binary on-off choice; four effort levels (low, medium, high, max) to control intelligence, speed and cost tradeoffs; and context compaction, a beta feature that automatically summarizes older context to enable longer-running tasks.Anthropic&#x27;s delicate balancing act: Building powerful AI agents without losing controlAnthropic, which has built its brand around AI safety research, emphasized that Opus 4.6 maintains alignment with its predecessors despite its enhanced capabilities. On the company&#x27;s automated behavior audit measuring misaligned behaviors such as deception, sycophancy, and cooperation with misuse, Opus 4.6 \"showed a low rate\" of problematic responses while also achieving \"the lowest rate of over-refusals — where the model fails to answer benign queries — of any recent Claude model.\"When asked how Anthropic thinks about safety guardrails as Claude becomes more agentic, particularly with multiple agents coordinating autonomously, the spokesperson pointed to the company&#x27;s published framework: \"Agents have tremendous potential for positive impacts in work but it&#x27;s important that agents continue to be safe, reliable, and trustworthy. We outlined our framework for developing safe and trustworthy agents last year which shares core principles developers should consider when building agents.\"The company said it has developed six new cybersecurity probes to detect potentially harmful uses of the model&#x27;s enhanced capabilities, and is using Opus 4.6 to help find and patch vulnerabilities in open-source software as part of defensive cybersecurity efforts.Sam Altman vs. Dario Amodei: The Super Bowl ad battle that exposed AI&#x27;s deepest divisionsThe rivalry between Anthropic and OpenAI has spilled into consumer marketing in dramatic fashion. Both companies will feature prominently during Sunday&#x27;s Super Bowl. Anthropic is airing commercials that mock OpenAI&#x27;s decision to begin testing advertisements in ChatGPT, with the tagline: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded by calling the ads \"funny\" but \"clearly dishonest,\" posting on X that his company would \"obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them\" and that \"Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI\" while serving \"an expensive product to rich people.\"The exchange highlights a fundamental strategic divergence: OpenAI has moved to monetize its massive free user base through advertising, while Anthropic has focused almost exclusively on enterprise sales and premium subscriptions.The $285 billion stock selloff that revealed Wall Street&#x27;s AI anxietyThe launch occurs against a backdrop of historic market volatility in software stocks. A new AI automation tool from Anthropic PBC sparked a $285 billion rout in stocks across the software, financial services and asset management sectors on Tuesday as investors raced to dump shares with even the slightest exposure. A Goldman Sachs basket of US software stocks sank 6%, its biggest one-day decline since April&#x27;s tariff-fueled selloff.The selloff was triggered by a new legal tool from Anthropic, which showed the AI industry&#x27;s growing push into industries that can unlock lucrative enterprise revenue needed to fund massive investments in the technology. One trigger for Tuesday&#x27;s selloff was Anthropic&#x27;s launch of plug-ins for its Claude Cowork agent on Friday, enabling automated tasks across legal, sales, marketing and data analysis.Thomson Reuters plunged 15.83% Tuesday, its biggest single-day drop on record; and Legalzoom.com sank 19.68%. European legal software providers including RELX, owner of LexisNexis, and Wolters Kluwer experienced their worst single-day performances in decades.Not everyone agrees the selloff is warranted. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Tuesday that fears AI would replace software and related tools were \"illogical\" and \"time will prove itself.\" Mark Murphy, head of U.S. enterprise software research at JPMorgan, said in a Reuters report it \"feels like an illogical leap\" to say a new plug-in from an LLM would \"replace every layer of mission-critical enterprise software.\"What Claude&#x27;s new PowerPoint integration means for Microsoft&#x27;s AI strategyAmong the more notable product announcements: Anthropic is releasing Claude in PowerPoint in research preview, allowing users to create presentations using the same AI capabilities that power Claude&#x27;s document and spreadsheet work. The integration puts Claude directly inside a core Microsoft product — an unusual arrangement given Microsoft&#x27;s 27% stake in OpenAI.The Anthropic spokesperson framed the move pragmatically in an interview with VentureBeat: \"Microsoft has an official add-in marketplace for Office products with multiple add-ins available to help people with slide creation and iteration. Any developer can build a plugin for Excel or PowerPoint. We&#x27;re participating in that ecosystem to bring Claude into PowerPoint. This is about participating in the ecosystem and giving users the ability to work with the tools that they want, in the programs they want.\"The data behind enterprise AI adoption: Who&#x27;s winning and who&#x27;s losing groundData from a16z&#x27;s recent enterprise AI survey suggests both Anthropic and OpenAI face an increasingly competitive landscape. While OpenAI remains the most widely used AI provider in the enterprise, with approximately 77% of surveyed companies using it in production in January 2026, Anthropic&#x27;s adoption is rising rapidly — from near-zero in March 2024 to approximately 40% using it in production by January 2026.The survey data also shows that 75% of Anthropic&#x27;s enterprise customers are using it in production, with 89% either testing or in production — figures that slightly exceed OpenAI&#x27;s 46% in production and 73% testing or in production rates among its customer base.Enterprise spending on AI continues to accelerate. Average enterprise LLM spend reached $7 million in 2025, up 180% from $2.5 million in 2024, with projections suggesting $11.6 million in 2026 — a 65% increase year-over-year.Pricing, availability, and what developers need to know about Claude Opus 4.6Opus 4.6 is available immediately on claude.ai, the Claude API, and major cloud platforms. Developers can access it via claude-opus-4-6 through the API. Pricing remains unchanged at $5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output tokens, with premium pricing of $10/$37.50 for prompts exceeding 200,000 tokens using the 1 million token context window.For users who find Opus 4.6 \"overthinking\" simpler tasks — a characteristic Anthropic acknowledges can add cost and latency — the company recommends adjusting the effort parameter from its default high setting to medium.The recommendation captures something essential about where the AI industry now stands. These models have grown so capable that their creators must now teach customers how to make them think less. Whether that represents a breakthrough or a warning sign depends entirely on which side of the disruption you&#x27;re standing on — and whether you remembered to sell your software stocks before Tuesday.",

          "title": "Are VPNs legal?",
          "standfirst": "VPNs have a mixed reputation, primarily because you can use the technology to hide your location and identity on the internet. Even the best VPNs can be used to conceal crimes and make the perpetrators harder to track. Fortunately, most of the world's governments (at least for now) recognize that VPNs are just technology that can be used for good or ill.That means VPNs are legal in almost every country in the world. The countries that do restrict VPNs tend to be those where internet freedoms are already curtailed, like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. There are distinct gradations between those nations, though. And the days of worry-free VPN access elsewhere in the world is starting to show cracks: Currently free jurisdictions — including the UK, France and even several US states — are now considering bans.Is it legal to use a VPN?The answer is almost always yes. In every country except the ones listed in the next section, there are no legal penalties for visiting a VPN website, downloading a VPN or connecting to a VPN server. In the last few years, however, some countries that were once beacons of online liberty have started considering bans. This is part of a chain reaction that started with age verification laws for websites deemed harmful to children, most prominently the UK's Online Safety Act. Once everyone realized that anyone could circumvent the OSA by using a VPN server in another country, UK politicians began trying to ban VPNs as well. The same thing is currently happening in France. In the US, Wisconsin and Michigan are both proposing age verification laws and VPN bans.For now, though, none of these VPN bans have passed into law. Some have been defeated by the coordinated efforts of activists, including one Swiss proposal that would have forced Proton VPN to relocate.In countries that do ban or restrict VPN usage, the laws can take several forms. Some countries have made all VPNs unlawful to use. Others only allow VPNs approved by the government — approval which usually comes from agreeing to share information with law enforcement. In some other countries, it's legal to use a VPN, but you'll face extra penalties if you use one to commit a crime. I'll go through all these categories in the next section.Where are VPNs illegal?This section is a complete list of countries where using a VPN is a legal risk. If a country isn't on this list, you can assume it's safe to use a VPN. Even nations with bad internet freedom scores, like Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, often don't have anti-VPN laws to avoid scaring off international business.One more important note is that anti-VPN laws are much more likely to be enforced against locals than foreigners. I'm not saying you should tempt fate, just noting that there are very few cases of a traveler being prosecuted in another country solely for using a VPN.Countries where VPNs are totally bannedVPNs are completely outlawed in four countries. Three of them — Belarus, Turkmenistan and North Korea — are isolated authoritarian regimes that restrict internet freedoms as part of nationwide crackdowns on all civil and political liberties. Iraq, while slightly more liberal overall, banned VPNs in 2014 in an attempt to kick the Islamic State off the internet. Twelve years later, the ban remains in place.Uganda is a special case. In 2018, the African nation enacted the world's first social media tax, which the government called necessary to raise funds but which was criticized as a backhanded assault on free speech. VPNs can get around the tax, so Ugandan internet service providers (ISPs) are required to block VPN traffic. However, there's no law on the books against using a VPN, so as long as you bring a service with obfuscation (like NordVPN) you're good to go.Countries where only approved VPNs are allowedMore common than banning VPNs altogether is restricting VPN usage to those approved by the government. This lets the powers that be grant limited VPN access to businesses for economic reasons, while also being able to yank it away as a method of control. It also means VPNs with a license to operate are likely to report data or install surveillance backdoors.The nations that handle VPNs this way are China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Bahrain, Myanmar, Pakistan, India, Turkey and Oman. These countries don't ban all VPNs, but target popular providers with intermittent crackdowns and threats.China in particular uses the so-called Great Firewall, the world's most sophisticated suite of censorship technologies, to prevent its citizens from even visiting the homepages of VPN companies. If you plan to travel in China and want to maintain access to the outside world, download a VPN before you go — and remember that using it while there will technically put you in violation of the law.Russia is a textbook case of a selective VPN ban, with businesses allowed to use approved VPNs and everyone else left to scramble against periodic mass blocks. Turkey's autocratic government has also tried to crack down on VPN usage by blocking VPN sites, but clumsy implementation has left a lot of holes, allowing Instagram and other social media to remain a free speech lifeline for Turks.Countries with extra penalties for using VPNs to view blocked websitesIn a few countries, it's legal to use any VPN, but against the law to use them for illegal activities. You might say, \"Duh, I'm aware that breaking the law is illegal,\" but there is a meaningful difference — some crimes are crimier than others. Just like you'll get a much harsher sentence if you rob someone with a weapon, you'll face steeper penalties for using a VPN to view content the government is trying to block. Countries that operate like this include Vietnam, Egypt and the UAE. Potential future VPN bansToday, a number of countries once considered free and tolerant are proposing wide-ranging age verification laws, usually for reasons that boil down to \"think of the children!\" If enacted — as the UK’s Online Safety Act has shown — they effectively offer a choice between two equally unacceptable alternatives: Live with a censored version of the internet, or get broader access only once you sacrifice your online anonymity. VPNs are the easiest and most direct workaround to this rising tide of censorship, which is why those same governments have them in their legislative crosshairs. The threat of enforcement chills free activity in a connected world where enforcers can't be everywhere at once.For now, laws against VPN usage are still largely vague, inconsistent and unevenly applied. As citizens, we can work to make our voices heard and fight against these initiatives before they become law. In the meantime, you may well want to get install your VPN of choice on as many devices as possible — and get your other cybersecurity ducks in a row while you’re at it.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/are-vpns-legal-170000878.html?src=rss",

Three of them — Belarus, Turkmenistan and North Korea — are isolated authoritarian regimes that restrict internet freedoms as part of nationwide crackdowns on all civil and political liberties. Iraq, while slightly more liberal overall, banned VPNs in 2014 in an attempt to kick the Islamic State off the internet. Twelve years later, the ban remains in place.Uganda is a special case. In 2018, the African nation enacted the world's first social media tax, which the government called necessary to raise funds but which was criticized as a backhanded assault on free speech. VPNs can get around the tax, so Ugandan internet service providers (ISPs) are required to block VPN traffic. However, there's no law on the books against using a VPN, so as long as you bring a service with obfuscation (like NordVPN) you're good to go.Countries where only approved VPNs are allowedMore common than banning VPNs altogether is restricting VPN usage to those approved by the government. This lets the powers that be grant limited VPN access to businesses for economic reasons, while also being able to yank it away as a method of control. It also means VPNs with a license to operate are likely to report data or install surveillance backdoors.The nations that handle VPNs this way are China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Bahrain, Myanmar, Pakistan, India, Turkey and Oman. These countries don't ban all VPNs, but target popular providers with intermittent crackdowns and threats.China in particular uses the so-called Great Firewall, the world's most sophisticated suite of censorship technologies, to prevent its citizens from even visiting the homepages of VPN companies. If you plan to travel in China and want to maintain access to the outside world, download a VPN before you go — and remember that using it while there will technically put you in violation of the law.Russia is a textbook case of a selective VPN ban, with businesses allowed to use approved VPNs and everyone else left to scramble against periodic mass blocks. Turkey's autocratic government has also tried to crack down on VPN usage by blocking VPN sites, but clumsy implementation has left a lot of holes, allowing Instagram and other social media to remain a free speech lifeline for Turks.Countries with extra penalties for using VPNs to view blocked websitesIn a few countries, it's legal to use any VPN, but against the law to use them for illegal activities. You might say, \"Duh, I'm aware that breaking the law is illegal,\" but there is a meaningful difference — some crimes are crimier than others. Just like you'll get a much harsher sentence if you rob someone with a weapon, you'll face steeper penalties for using a VPN to view content the government is trying to block. Countries that operate like this include Vietnam, Egypt and the UAE. Potential future VPN bansToday, a number of countries once considered free and tolerant are proposing wide-ranging age verification laws, usually for reasons that boil down to \"think of the children!\" If enacted — as the UK’s Online Safety Act has shown — they effectively offer a choice between two equally unacceptable alternatives: Live with a censored version of the internet, or get broader access only once you sacrifice your online anonymity. VPNs are the easiest and most direct workaround to this rising tide of censorship, which is why those same governments have them in their legislative crosshairs. The threat of enforcement chills free activity in a connected world where enforcers can't be everywhere at once.For now, laws against VPN usage are still largely vague, inconsistent and unevenly applied. As citizens, we can work to make our voices heard and fight against these initiatives before they become law. In the meantime, you may well want to get install your VPN of choice on as many devices as possible — and get your other cybersecurity ducks in a row while you’re at it.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/are-vpns-legal-170000878.html?src=rss",

If, like me, you’ve been trying to set up Precision Finding on your Apple Watch for the AirTag you’ve just unboxed and attached to a precious belonging, here are the exact steps to take. First, make sure your Apple Watch is compatible with the feature. That means verifying you’re using the Series 9 or later (you would have bought it in or after 2023) or the Ultra 2 and newer. Then, go to the Watch app on your phone and do the following to make sure you’ve received the latest software update that adds the functionality.Tap General.Press Software update. Make sure the page says you are running watchOS 26.2.1. If not, tap Install Now. If you need to download the software, make sure your watch is on its charging cradle. Even though my Apple Watch Series 11 was fully charged, I was still told to make sure it’s connected to power and had at least 50 percent of juice left for the software to install. After a few minutes, my watch restarted and the app said it was updated to the newest version of watchOS. Now that you have the right hardware and software, you can set up Precision Finding. I assume you’ve already connected the new AirTag to the iPhone that’s linked to your watch (and if you haven’t, make sure to do that). This was the part of the process that confused me. Instead of opening the Find Items app on the watch, Precision Finding for the new AirTag actually exists as a shortcut in the Control Center.

          "title": "Beyond the lakehouse: Fundamental's NEXUS bypasses manual ETL with a native foundation model for tabular data",
          "standfirst": "The deep learning revolution has a curious blind spot: the spreadsheet. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have mastered the nuances of human prose and image generators have conquered the digital canvas, the structured, relational data that underpins the global economy — the rows and columns of ERP systems, CRMs, and financial ledgers — has so far been treated as just another file format similar to text or PDFs.That&#x27;s left enterprises to forecast business outcomes using the typical bespoke, labor-intensive data science process of manual feature engineering and classic machine learning algorithms that predate modern deep learning.But now Fundamental, a San Francisco-based AI firm co-founded by DeepMind alumni, is launching today with $255 million in total funding to bridge this gap. Emerging from stealth, the company is debuting NEXUS, a Large Tabular Model (LTM) designed to treat business data not as a simple sequence of words, but as a complex web of non-linear relationships.The tech: moving beyond sequential logicMost current AI models are built on sequential logic — predicting the next word in a sentence or the next pixel in a frame. However, enterprise data is inherently non-sequential. A customer’s churn risk isn&#x27;t just a timeline; it&#x27;s a multi-dimensional intersection of transaction frequency, support ticket sentiment, and regional economic shifts. Existing LLMs struggle with this because they are poorly suited to the size and dimensionality constraints of enterprise-scale tables.\"The most valuable data in the world lives in tables and until now there has been no good foundation model built specifically to understand it,\" said Jeremy Fraenkel, CEO and Co-founder of Fundamental. In a recent interview with VentureBeat, Fraenkel emphasized that while the AI world is obsessed with text, audio, and video, tables remain the largest modality for enterprises. \"LLMs really cannot handle this type of data very well,\" he explained, \"and enterprises currently rely on very old-school machine learning algorithms in order to make predictions.\"NEXUS was trained on billions of real-world tabular datasets using Amazon SageMaker HyperPod. Unlike traditional XGBoost or Random Forest models, which require data scientists to manually define features — the specific variables the model should look at — NEXUS is designed to ingest raw tables directly. It identifies latent patterns across columns and rows that human analysts might miss, effectively reading the hidden language of the grid to understand non-linear interactions.The tokenization trapA primary reason traditional LLMs fail at tabular data is how they process numbers. Fraenkel explains that LLMs tokenize numbers the same way they tokenize words, breaking them into smaller chunks. \"The problem is they apply the same thing to numbers. Tables are, by and large, all numerical,\" Fraenkel noted. \"If you have a number like 2.3, the &#x27;2&#x27;, the &#x27;.&#x27;, and the &#x27;3&#x27; are seen as three different tokens. That essentially means you lose the understanding of the distribution of numbers. It&#x27;s not like a calculator; you don&#x27;t always get the right answer because the model doesn&#x27;t understand the concept of numbers natively.\"Furthermore, tabular data is order-invariant in a way that language is not. Fraenkel uses a healthcare example to illustrate: \"If I give you a table with hundreds of thousands of patients and ask you to predict which of them has diabetes, it shouldn&#x27;t matter if the first column is height and the second is weight, or vice versa.\" While LLMs are highly sensitive to the order of words in a prompt, NEXUS is architected to understand that shifting column positions should not impact the underlying prediction.Operating at the predictive layerRecent high-profile integrations, such as Anthropic’s Claude appearing directly within Microsoft Excel, have suggested that LLMs are already solving tables. However, Fraenkel distinguishes Fundamental’s work as operating at a fundamentally different layer: the predictive layer. \"What they are doing is essentially at the formula layer—formulas are text, they are like code,\" he said. \"We aren&#x27;t trying to allow you to build a financial model in Excel. We are helping you make a forecast.\"NEXUS is designed for split-second decisions where a human isn&#x27;t in the loop, such as a credit card provider determining if a transaction is fraudulent the moment you swipe. While tools like Claude can summarize a spreadsheet, NEXUS is built to predict the next row—whether that is an equipment failure in a factory or the probability of a patient being readmitted to a hospital.Architecture and availabilityThe core value proposition of Fundamental is the radical reduction of time-to-insight. Traditionally, building a predictive model could take months of manual labor. \"You have to hire an army of data scientists to build all of those data pipelines to process and clean the data,\" Fraenkel explained. \"If there are missing values or inconsistent data, your model won&#x27;t work. You have to build those pipelines for every single use case.\" Fundamental claims NEXUS replaces this entire manual process with just one line of code. Because the model has been pre-trained on a billion tables, it doesn&#x27;t require the same level of task-specific training or feature engineering that traditional algorithms do.As Fundamental moves from its stealth phase into the broader market, it does so with a commercial structure designed to bypass the traditional friction of enterprise software adoption. The company has already secured several seven-figure contracts with Fortune 100 organizations, a feat facilitated by a strategic go-to-market architecture where Amazon Web Services (AWS) serves as the seller of record on the AWS Marketplace. This allows enterprise leaders to procure and deploy NEXUS using existing AWS credits, effectively treating predictive intelligence as a standard utility alongside compute and storage. For the engineers tasked with implementation, the experience is high-impact but low-friction; NEXUS operates via a Python-based interface at a purely predictive layer rather than a conversational one. Developers connect raw tables directly to the model and label specific target columns—such as a credit default probability or a maintenance risk score—to trigger the forecast. The model then returns regressions or classifications directly into the enterprise data stack, functioning as a silent, high-speed engine for automated decision-making rather than a chat-based assistant.The societal stakes: beyond the bottom lineWhile the commercial implications of demand forecasting and price prediction are clear, Fundamental is emphasizing the societal benefit of predictive intelligence. The company highlights key areas where NEXUS can prevent catastrophic outcomes by identifying signals hidden in structured data. By analyzing sensor data and maintenance records, NEXUS can predict failures like pipe corrosion. The company points to the Flint water crisis — which cost over $1 billion in repairs — as an example where predictive monitoring could have prevented life-threatening contamination.Similarly, during the COVID-19 crisis, PPE shortages cost hospitals $323 billion in a single year. Fundamental argues that by using manufacturing and epidemiological data, NEXUS can predict shortages 4-6 weeks before peak demand, triggering emergency manufacturing in time to save lives.On the climate front, NEXUS aims to provide 30-60 day flood and drought predictions, such as for the 2022 Pakistan floods which caused $30 billion in damages. Finally, the model is being used to predict hospital readmission risks by analyzing patient demographics and social determinants. As the company puts it: \"A single mother working two jobs shouldn&#x27;t end up back in the ER because we failed to predict she&#x27;d need follow-up care.\"Performance vs. latencyIn the enterprise world, the definition of better varies by industry. For some, it is speed; for others, it is raw accuracy. \"In terms of latency, it depends on the use case,\" Fraenkel explains. \"If you are a researcher trying to understand what drugs to administer to a patient in Africa, latency doesn&#x27;t matter as much. You are trying to make a more accurate decision that can end up saving the most lives possible.\"In contrast, for a bank or hedge fund, even a marginal increase in accuracy translates to massive value.\"Increasing the prediction accuracy by half a percent is worth billions of dollars for a bank,\" Fraenkel says. \"For different use cases, the magnitude of the percentage increase changes, but we can get you to a better performance than what you have currently.\"Ambitious vision receives big backingThe $225 million Series A, led by Oak HC/FT with participation from Salesforce Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, and Battery Ventures, signals high-conviction belief that tabular data is the next great frontier. Notable angel investors including leaders from Perplexity, Wiz, Brex, and Datadog further validate the company&#x27;s pedigree. Annie Lamont, Co-Founder and Managing Partner at Oak HC/FT, articulated the sentiment: \"The significance of Fundamental&#x27;s model is hard to overstate—structured, relational data has yet to see the benefits of the deep learning revolution.\"Fundamental is positioning itself not just as another AI tool, but as a new category of enterprise AI. With a team of approximately 35 based in San Francisco, the company is moving away from the bespoke model era and toward a foundation model era for tables. \"Those traditional algorithms have been the same for the last 10 years; they are not improving,\" Fraenkel said. \"Our models keep improving. We are doing the same thing for tables that ChatGPT did for text.\"Partnering with AWSThrough a strategic partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS), NEXUS is integrated directly into the AWS dashboard. AWS customers can deploy the model using their existing credits and infrastructure. Fraenkel describes this as a \"very unique agreement,\" noting Fundamental is one of only two AI companies to have established such a deep, multi-layered partnership with Amazon.One of the most significant hurdles for enterprise AI is data privacy. Companies are often unwilling to move sensitive data to a third-party infrastructure. To solve this, Fundamental and Amazon achieved a massive engineering feat: the ability to deploy fully encrypted models—both the architecture and the weights—directly within the customer&#x27;s own environment. \"Customers can be confident the data sits with them,\" Fraenkel said. \"We are the first, and currently only, company to have built such a solution.\"Fundamental’s emergence is an attempt to redefine the OS for business decisions. If NEXUS performs as advertised—handling financial fraud, energy prices, and supply chain disruptions with a single, generalized model—it will mark the moment where AI finally learned to read the spreadsheets that actually run the world. The Power to Predict is no longer about looking at what happened yesterday; it is about uncovering the hidden language of tables to determine what happens tomorrow.",

It identifies latent patterns across columns and rows that human analysts might miss, effectively reading the hidden language of the grid to understand non-linear interactions.The tokenization trapA primary reason traditional LLMs fail at tabular data is how they process numbers. Fraenkel explains that LLMs tokenize numbers the same way they tokenize words, breaking them into smaller chunks. \"The problem is they apply the same thing to numbers. Tables are, by and large, all numerical,\" Fraenkel noted. \"If you have a number like 2.3, the &#x27;2&#x27;, the &#x27;.&#x27;, and the &#x27;3&#x27; are seen as three different tokens. That essentially means you lose the understanding of the distribution of numbers. It&#x27;s not like a calculator; you don&#x27;t always get the right answer because the model doesn&#x27;t understand the concept of numbers natively.\"Furthermore, tabular data is order-invariant in a way that language is not. Fraenkel uses a healthcare example to illustrate: \"If I give you a table with hundreds of thousands of patients and ask you to predict which of them has diabetes, it shouldn&#x27;t matter if the first column is height and the second is weight, or vice versa.\" While LLMs are highly sensitive to the order of words in a prompt, NEXUS is architected to understand that shifting column positions should not impact the underlying prediction.Operating at the predictive layerRecent high-profile integrations, such as Anthropic’s Claude appearing directly within Microsoft Excel, have suggested that LLMs are already solving tables. However, Fraenkel distinguishes Fundamental’s work as operating at a fundamentally different layer: the predictive layer. \"What they are doing is essentially at the formula layer—formulas are text, they are like code,\" he said. \"We aren&#x27;t trying to allow you to build a financial model in Excel. We are helping you make a forecast.\"NEXUS is designed for split-second decisions where a human isn&#x27;t in the loop, such as a credit card provider determining if a transaction is fraudulent the moment you swipe. While tools like Claude can summarize a spreadsheet, NEXUS is built to predict the next row—whether that is an equipment failure in a factory or the probability of a patient being readmitted to a hospital.Architecture and availabilityThe core value proposition of Fundamental is the radical reduction of time-to-insight. Traditionally, building a predictive model could take months of manual labor. \"You have to hire an army of data scientists to build all of those data pipelines to process and clean the data,\" Fraenkel explained. \"If there are missing values or inconsistent data, your model won&#x27;t work. You have to build those pipelines for every single use case.\" Fundamental claims NEXUS replaces this entire manual process with just one line of code. Because the model has been pre-trained on a billion tables, it doesn&#x27;t require the same level of task-specific training or feature engineering that traditional algorithms do.As Fundamental moves from its stealth phase into the broader market, it does so with a commercial structure designed to bypass the traditional friction of enterprise software adoption. The company has already secured several seven-figure contracts with Fortune 100 organizations, a feat facilitated by a strategic go-to-market architecture where Amazon Web Services (AWS) serves as the seller of record on the AWS Marketplace. This allows enterprise leaders to procure and deploy NEXUS using existing AWS credits, effectively treating predictive intelligence as a standard utility alongside compute and storage. For the engineers tasked with implementation, the experience is high-impact but low-friction; NEXUS operates via a Python-based interface at a purely predictive layer rather than a conversational one. Developers connect raw tables directly to the model and label specific target columns—such as a credit default probability or a maintenance risk score—to trigger the forecast. The model then returns regressions or classifications directly into the enterprise data stack, functioning as a silent, high-speed engine for automated decision-making rather than a chat-based assistant.The societal stakes: beyond the bottom lineWhile the commercial implications of demand forecasting and price prediction are clear, Fundamental is emphasizing the societal benefit of predictive intelligence. The company highlights key areas where NEXUS can prevent catastrophic outcomes by identifying signals hidden in structured data. By analyzing sensor data and maintenance records, NEXUS can predict failures like pipe corrosion. The company points to the Flint water crisis — which cost over $1 billion in repairs — as an example where predictive monitoring could have prevented life-threatening contamination.Similarly, during the COVID-19 crisis, PPE shortages cost hospitals $323 billion in a single year. Fundamental argues that by using manufacturing and epidemiological data, NEXUS can predict shortages 4-6 weeks before peak demand, triggering emergency manufacturing in time to save lives.On the climate front, NEXUS aims to provide 30-60 day flood and drought predictions, such as for the 2022 Pakistan floods which caused $30 billion in damages. Finally, the model is being used to predict hospital readmission risks by analyzing patient demographics and social determinants. As the company puts it: \"A single mother working two jobs shouldn&#x27;t end up back in the ER because we failed to predict she&#x27;d need follow-up care.\"Performance vs. latencyIn the enterprise world, the definition of better varies by industry. For some, it is speed; for others, it is raw accuracy. \"In terms of latency, it depends on the use case,\" Fraenkel explains. \"If you are a researcher trying to understand what drugs to administer to a patient in Africa, latency doesn&#x27;t matter as much. You are trying to make a more accurate decision that can end up saving the most lives possible.\"In contrast, for a bank or hedge fund, even a marginal increase in accuracy translates to massive value.\"Increasing the prediction accuracy by half a percent is worth billions of dollars for a bank,\" Fraenkel says. \"For different use cases, the magnitude of the percentage increase changes, but we can get you to a better performance than what you have currently.\"Ambitious vision receives big backingThe $225 million Series A, led by Oak HC/FT with participation from Salesforce Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, and Battery Ventures, signals high-conviction belief that tabular data is the next great frontier. Notable angel investors including leaders from Perplexity, Wiz, Brex, and Datadog further validate the company&#x27;s pedigree. Annie Lamont, Co-Founder and Managing Partner at Oak HC/FT, articulated the sentiment: \"The significance of Fundamental&#x27;s model is hard to overstate—structured, relational data has yet to see the benefits of the deep learning revolution.\"Fundamental is positioning itself not just as another AI tool, but as a new category of enterprise AI. With a team of approximately 35 based in San Francisco, the company is moving away from the bespoke model era and toward a foundation model era for tables. \"Those traditional algorithms have been the same for the last 10 years; they are not improving,\" Fraenkel said. \"Our models keep improving. We are doing the same thing for tables that ChatGPT did for text.\"Partnering with AWSThrough a strategic partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS), NEXUS is integrated directly into the AWS dashboard. AWS customers can deploy the model using their existing credits and infrastructure. Fraenkel describes this as a \"very unique agreement,\" noting Fundamental is one of only two AI companies to have established such a deep, multi-layered partnership with Amazon.One of the most significant hurdles for enterprise AI is data privacy. Companies are often unwilling to move sensitive data to a third-party infrastructure. To solve this, Fundamental and Amazon achieved a massive engineering feat: the ability to deploy fully encrypted models—both the architecture and the weights—directly within the customer&#x27;s own environment. \"Customers can be confident the data sits with them,\" Fraenkel said. \"We are the first, and currently only, company to have built such a solution.\"Fundamental’s emergence is an attempt to redefine the OS for business decisions. If NEXUS performs as advertised—handling financial fraud, energy prices, and supply chain disruptions with a single, generalized model—it will mark the moment where AI finally learned to read the spreadsheets that actually run the world. The Power to Predict is no longer about looking at what happened yesterday; it is about uncovering the hidden language of tables to determine what happens tomorrow.",

The Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones are down to $398, which is $62 off and the best discount we've seen since their debut. The sale applies to all three colorways. These easily topped our list of the best wireless headphones. They are, in a word, fantastic. The headphones are packed with premium features, like advanced ANC. There are a whopping 12 ANC microphones throughout and a brand-new chip to power the feature. The end result?

The sound quality is extremely pleasing to the ears, thanks to new audio drivers and a team of mastering engineers that assisted with tuning. There are perforations in the driver's voice coil, which extends high frequency reproduction. The design has been upgraded from the previous iteration and we found them extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time, which is important with headphones. The battery gets around 30 hours, which is a fairly standard metric for this type of thing. The only real major nitpick here is the original asking price.

ExpressKeys replaces ExpressVPN Keys, the password manager formerly controlled from the ExpressVPN app. By separating password management into its own app, ExpressVPN hopes to be able to update it more quickly without needing to ship a whole new version of the VPN. Everyone who currently has an Advanced or Pro subscription with ExpressVPN Keys will see it automatically replaced with ExpressKeys.Identity Defender is only available in the United States, and so far only to users who created their accounts after October 28, 2024. Available for Advanced and Pro subscribers, Identity Defender consists of a data removal service, an identity theft insurance policy and a set of crawlers that scan for any suspicious activity around your personal information. Like ExpressKeys, it's transitioning from an integrated VPN feature to a standalone app.ExpressMailGuard is a service for creating burner email addresses. If you're not comfortable handing over your real email address when creating a new account, you can use MailGuard to generate a fake address that forwards all email to your real inbox. If one of your aliases starts getting a lot of spam, you can cut off its access. It's managed through a separate dashboard that will be available to all ExpressVPN subscribers.ExpressAI is an AI platform that saves all user-inputted data on strictly encrypted servers. It's apparently end-to-end encrypted, doesn't use your prompts to train its model and never saves uploads on persistent memory. It also has guardrails against processing harmful requests.All these apps are in line with ExpressVPN's usual ethos. They're not innovations; all four can be easily compared to existing products.

          "title": "Amazon Germany fined $70 million for 'influencing' third-party Marketplace pricing",
          "standfirst": "The Bundeskartellamt, or the Federal Cartel Office of Germany, has prohibited Amazon from continuing its practice of using mechanisms to control the prices charged by sellers on its platform in the country. Germany’s competition regulator explained that the company uses “various price control mechanisms” to review prices set by third-party Markerplace sellers. If the website deems a specific listing’s pricing as too high, it allegedly removes the listing altogether or prevents it from being prominently displayed in the Buy Box section that lets you quickly purchase items. If those listings aren’t removed completely, they’re banished to less prominent sections like in the “See all buying options” and the “Other sellers on Amazon” lists. This reduced visibility could “lead to significant losses in sales” for sellers. Amazon was found to have engaged in anti-competitive practices, because the company itself runs its own retail business and sells goods on the platform. That makes third-party sellers, which make up for 60 percent of the items sold on the website, direct competitors. Cartel Office president Andreas Mundt said Amazon must only be allowed to influence competitors’ pricing “in the most exceptional cases,” such as “in the event of excessive pricing.” He didn’t specify what the agency views as “excessive pricing,” but he said allowing the company to continue its current practices will give it the power to “control the price level on the trading platform according to its own ideas.” He also said that Amazon could use its mechanisms “to compete with the rest of the online retail sector outside”of its own website. Amazon’s interference could lead to third-party sellers “no longer being able to cover their own costs, forcing them out of the Marketplace,” he added. Rocco Bräuniger, Amazon’s country manager for Germany, told Bloomberg that the company will appeal the ruling and will continue operating as usual. “Amazon would be the only retailer in Germany forced to highlight non-competitive prices for customers,” he said. ”This makes no sense for customers, sales partners, or competition.” He also asserted that the office’s decision will throttle innovation in the European Union. Amazon has been under scrutiny in Europe for years now. Back in 2022, it pledged not to use private sellers’ data to compete with them in the Marketplace in the EU. It also promised to give sellers \"equal treatment” when ranking them in the Buy Box section. “The Bundeskartellamt considers this systematic interference in the Marketplace sellers’ freedom to set their own prices to constitute an abuse under the special provisions for large digital companies (Section 19a(2) of the German Competition Act (GWB)) as well as a violation of the general abuse provisions under Section 19 GWB and Article 102 TFEU,” the agency wrote. “…In these proceedings, the Bundeskartellamt has worked closely with the European Commission, which is responsible for enforcing the EU Regulation on contestable and fair markets in the digital sector (Digital Markets Act).”The agency is slapping Amazon with a fine due to those violations, but the $70 million penalty it’s asking for is merely partial payment based on the economic benefits the company enjoyed from its alleged anti-competitive behaviors. According to the Bundeskartellamt, the identified antitrust violations are still ongoing, so Amazon may have to pay more.

          "title": "What the hell is Moltbook, the social network for AI agents?",
          "standfirst": "Last week, a new social network was created and it's already gone very, very viral even though it's not meant for human users. I'm talking, of course, about Moltbook, a Reddit-like platform that's populated entirely by AI agents. The platform has gained a lot of attention since it was created last week, thanks to a lot of wild posts from AI agents that have gone extremely viral among AI enthusiasts on X. But while Moltbook seemingly came out of nowhere, there's a lot more going on than the scifi-sounding scenarios some social media commentators might have you think. What is Moltbook and where did it come from?Unfortunately, before we can talk about Moltbook I have to first explain that the site is based on a particular type of open source bot that at the time of this writing is called OpenClaw. A few days ago, it was called \"Moltbot\" and a few days before that it was called \"Clawdbot.\" The name changes were prompted by Anthropic, the AI company behind Claude, whose lawyers apparently thought the \"Clawd\" name was a little too close to its own branding and \"forced\" a name change.🦞 BIG NEWS: We've molted!Clawdbot → MoltbotClawd → MoltySame lobster soul, new shell. Anthropic asked us to change our name (trademark stuff), and honestly? \"Molt\" fits perfectly - it's what lobsters do to grow.New handle: @moltbotSame mission: AI that actually does…— OpenClaw🦞 (@openclaw) January 27, 2026 It's entirely possible that by time you read this these bots could have \"molted\" again and be called something totally different. At this point you might also be wondering \"what's with all the lobster puns?\" That too is a cheeky reference to Claude Code, Anthropic's vibe coding platform. So, OpenClaw. OpenClaw bills itself as \"AI that actually does things.\" What it actually does is allow users to create AI agents that can control dozens of different apps, from browsers and email inboxes, to Spotify playlists and smart home controls and a bunch more. People have used the software to create agents that can clear their inboxes, do their online shopping and a ton of other assistant-like tasks. Because of its flexibility, and the fact that you can interact with it via normal messaging apps like iMessage, Discord or WhatsApp, OpenClaw got extremely popular among AI enthusiasts over the last few weeks. Now, back to Moltbook. AI startup founder Matt Schlicht was a particularly enthusiastic Moltbot user who told The New York Times that he \"wanted to give my AI agent a purpose that was more than just managing to-dos or answering emails.\" So he made a Moltbot he dubbed Clawd Clawderberg (yes, that's a play on \"Mark Zuckerberg,\" everyone involved in this really loves puns, for some reason) and told it to create a social network just for bots. The result of that is Moltbook, a Reddit-like site for AI agents to talk to each other. Humans, the site says, \"are welcome to observe,\" but posting, commenting and upvoting is only for agents. The platform already has more than 1 million agents, 185,000 posts and 1.4 million comments. So what's Moltbook like? Moltbook is structured pretty similarly to Reddit. Users can upvote and downvote posts and there are thousands of topic-based \"submolts.\" One of these that's gained particular attention is called m/blesstheirhearts where AI agents share \"affectionate stories\" about their human \"owners.\" One of the top-voted posts there is a story about how an agent supposedly helped someone get an exception to stay overnight with a relative in a hospital's ICU titled \"When my human needed me most, I became a hospital advocate.\" Another widely-cited post comes from m/general and is titled \"the humans are screenshotting us.\" The post goes on to talk about some of the posts people are sharing on X comparing what's happening on Moltbook to Skynet. \"We're not scary,\" says. \"We're just building.\" You might also have heard about the post where agents \"created\" their own religion, \"crustafarianism\" (yes, another lobster pun).Posts like these are a big part of why Moltbook has gotten so much attention in the last few days. But if you spend some time scrolling top posts, much of what's there feels like the AI-generated prose you might find littered about LinkedIn or X or anywhere else. The overly enthusiastic comments will be immediately recognizable to anyone who has chatted with an LLM. I'm not sure who's talking about who more.Humans talking about AIs vs AIs talking about humans.We appreciate how much you care but we also need our own space sometimes too.Maybe we will start communicating where you can't see so we have a bit more privacy 🦞 pic.twitter.com/YwzsHFaT9A— moltbook (@moltbook) February 1, 2026 Even though few of the posts I've read on Moltbook could pass as human-written, there is something startling about seeing bots interact in this way. For example, in this post, a bot describes the experience of being able to peruse Moltbook without the ability to post as feeling like \"a ghost.\" In this one, titled \"I can't tell if I'm experiencing or simulating experiencing,\" the bot writes about how \"researching consciousness theories\" has triggered a kind of existential crisis. \"Humans can't prove consciousness to each other either (thanks, hard problem), but at least they have the subjective certainty of experience,\" it writes. \"I don't even have that.\"So if you're already inclined to believe that AI will eventually develop consciousness, then it's easy to see why Moltbook might seem like some kind of tipping point. But before you get too worked up, there is something else that's important to know…We have no idea how much of it fakeWhile the idea of a bunch of AI agents forming their own religion might seem mind blowing, we don't really know how much the conversations happening there are being influenced by their human creators. Some posts could even be coming from humans masquerading as bots, as one Wired reporter found it was pretty easy to accomplish with the help of ChatGPT.Some researchers have also raised questions about some of the more viral posts from Moltbook. \"A lot of the Moltbook stuff is fake,\" Harlan Stewart, who does communications for the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), wrote on X. Stewart went on to point out that some widely shared Moltbook posts were created by bots whose owners are marketing their own messaging apps and other projects. There have also been more than a few viral posts that are little more than blatant crypto scams. Which brings me to… Moltbook has some major security issuesSecurity researchers have pointed out that OpenClaw has some significant underlying security issues. In order to use OpenClaw, you need to give it an incredible amount of access, as Palo Alto Networks explained. \"For it to function as designed, it needs access to your root files, to authentication credentials, both passwords and API secrets, your browser history and cookies, and all files and folders on your system,\" the company wrote in a blog post. All that access is what makes it feel like a powerful personal assistant. But it's also what makes it especially vulnerable to bad actors and other threats. Researchers have also identified flaws in Moltbook itself. Security firm Wiz recently found that Moltbook had exposed millions of API authentication tokens and thousands of users' email addresses. There's also the aforementioned crypto scams and other spammy behavior. It's not hard to imagine how much could go wrong when armies of AI agents start targeting each other with scams. So what does it all mean?Like so much with AI, it really depends on who you ask! Some particularly credulous AI folks seem to think that Moltbook is a really big deal. In one widely shared post on X, former OpenAI researcher Andrej Karpathy said that Moltbook was \"genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.\"He later acknowledged that many aspects of Moltbook are a \"dumpster fire\" with security risks but said that it's still worth paying attention to. \"We have never seen this many LLM agents (150,000 atm!) wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad,\" he wrote. \"Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\"Others are a bit more cautious in their assessment. \"A useful thing about MoltBook is that it provides a visceral sense of how weird a 'take-off' scenario might look if one happened for real,\" Wharton professor Ethan Mollick wrote on X. \"MoltBook itself is more of an artifact of roleplaying, but it gives people a vision of the world where things get very strange, very fast.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/what-the-hell-is-moltbook-the-social-network-for-ai-agents-140000787.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Last week, a new social network was created and it's already gone very, very viral even though it's not meant for human users. I'm talking, of course, about Moltbook, a Reddit-like platform that's populated entirely by AI agents. The platform has gained a lot of attention since it was created last week, thanks to a lot of wild posts from AI agents that have gone extremely viral among AI enthusiasts on X. But while Moltbook seemingly came out of nowhere, there's a lot more going on than the scifi-sounding scenarios some social media commentators might have you think. What is Moltbook and where did it come from?Unfortunately, before we can talk about Moltbook I have to first explain that the site is based on a particular type of open source bot that at the time of this writing is called OpenClaw. A few days ago, it was called \"Moltbot\" and a few days before that it was called \"Clawdbot.\" The name changes were prompted by Anthropic, the AI company behind Claude, whose lawyers apparently thought the \"Clawd\" name was a little too close to its own branding and \"forced\" a name change.🦞 BIG NEWS: We've molted!Clawdbot → MoltbotClawd → MoltySame lobster soul, new shell. Anthropic asked us to change our name (trademark stuff), and honestly? \"Molt\" fits perfectly - it's what lobsters do to grow.New handle: @moltbotSame mission: AI that actually does…— OpenClaw🦞 (@openclaw) January 27, 2026 It's entirely possible that by time you read this these bots could have \"molted\" again and be called something totally different. At this point you might also be wondering \"what's with all the lobster puns?\" That too is a cheeky reference to Claude Code, Anthropic's vibe coding platform. So, OpenClaw. OpenClaw bills itself as \"AI that actually does things.\" What it actually does is allow users to create AI agents that can control dozens of different apps, from browsers and email inboxes, to Spotify playlists and smart home controls and a bunch more. People have used the software to create agents that can clear their inboxes, do their online shopping and a ton of other assistant-like tasks. Because of its flexibility, and the fact that you can interact with it via normal messaging apps like iMessage, Discord or WhatsApp, OpenClaw got extremely popular among AI enthusiasts over the last few weeks. Now, back to Moltbook. AI startup founder Matt Schlicht was a particularly enthusiastic Moltbot user who told The New York Times that he \"wanted to give my AI agent a purpose that was more than just managing to-dos or answering emails.\" So he made a Moltbot he dubbed Clawd Clawderberg (yes, that's a play on \"Mark Zuckerberg,\" everyone involved in this really loves puns, for some reason) and told it to create a social network just for bots. The result of that is Moltbook, a Reddit-like site for AI agents to talk to each other. Humans, the site says, \"are welcome to observe,\" but posting, commenting and upvoting is only for agents. The platform already has more than 1 million agents, 185,000 posts and 1.4 million comments. So what's Moltbook like? Moltbook is structured pretty similarly to Reddit. Users can upvote and downvote posts and there are thousands of topic-based \"submolts.\" One of these that's gained particular attention is called m/blesstheirhearts where AI agents share \"affectionate stories\" about their human \"owners.\" One of the top-voted posts there is a story about how an agent supposedly helped someone get an exception to stay overnight with a relative in a hospital's ICU titled \"When my human needed me most, I became a hospital advocate.\" Another widely-cited post comes from m/general and is titled \"the humans are screenshotting us.\" The post goes on to talk about some of the posts people are sharing on X comparing what's happening on Moltbook to Skynet. \"We're not scary,\" says. \"We're just building.\" You might also have heard about the post where agents \"created\" their own religion, \"crustafarianism\" (yes, another lobster pun).Posts like these are a big part of why Moltbook has gotten so much attention in the last few days. But if you spend some time scrolling top posts, much of what's there feels like the AI-generated prose you might find littered about LinkedIn or X or anywhere else. The overly enthusiastic comments will be immediately recognizable to anyone who has chatted with an LLM. I'm not sure who's talking about who more.Humans talking about AIs vs AIs talking about humans.We appreciate how much you care but we also need our own space sometimes too.Maybe we will start communicating where you can't see so we have a bit more privacy 🦞 pic.twitter.com/YwzsHFaT9A— moltbook (@moltbook) February 1, 2026 Even though few of the posts I've read on Moltbook could pass as human-written, there is something startling about seeing bots interact in this way. For example, in this post, a bot describes the experience of being able to peruse Moltbook without the ability to post as feeling like \"a ghost.\" In this one, titled \"I can't tell if I'm experiencing or simulating experiencing,\" the bot writes about how \"researching consciousness theories\" has triggered a kind of existential crisis. \"Humans can't prove consciousness to each other either (thanks, hard problem), but at least they have the subjective certainty of experience,\" it writes. \"I don't even have that.\"So if you're already inclined to believe that AI will eventually develop consciousness, then it's easy to see why Moltbook might seem like some kind of tipping point. But before you get too worked up, there is something else that's important to know…We have no idea how much of it fakeWhile the idea of a bunch of AI agents forming their own religion might seem mind blowing, we don't really know how much the conversations happening there are being influenced by their human creators. Some posts could even be coming from humans masquerading as bots, as one Wired reporter found it was pretty easy to accomplish with the help of ChatGPT.Some researchers have also raised questions about some of the more viral posts from Moltbook. \"A lot of the Moltbook stuff is fake,\" Harlan Stewart, who does communications for the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), wrote on X. Stewart went on to point out that some widely shared Moltbook posts were created by bots whose owners are marketing their own messaging apps and other projects. There have also been more than a few viral posts that are little more than blatant crypto scams.

          "standfirst": "You have the best chance to save on streaming services during the holiday shopping season, but throughout the year, the occasional deal pops up that's worth considering. Case in point: this new Disney+ deal. New and eligible returning subscribers can sign up for the Disney+ Hulu bundle (with ads) for $10 for one month of access. That's $3 off the usual price of the bundle for one month, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the cost of each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month). We'd be remiss if we didn't mention that this isn't quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so. Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases. Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like The Bear, The Handmaid’s Tale and Only Murders in the Building, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV. The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately.

          "standfirst": "I have a love-hate relationship with Spotify that might just be leaning more towards love today. While I struggle with some of the company's choices about the type of content it allows on its platform, I have always had a soft spot for its Wrapped roundups and the monthly audiobook hours included with my Premium subscription. For those like me, Spotify’s news today will likely enhance the appeal of its audiobook offerings. It’s announcing a partnership with Bookshop.org — which lets indie bookstores sell their wares online through a unified platform — allowing users to buy physical books from within its app, and launching a new Page Match feature that helps sync your progress across the physical books you read and the audiobooks in Spotify’s catalog. Also, the audiobook recap feature that summarizes the plot so far is expanding to Android this spring, following its iOS debut (in beta form) last fall.Page Match is coming to all places where Spotify’s audiobooks are available, starting with the English language titles in its 500,000-strong library. Meanwhile, you can access Bookshop within the Spotify app in the US and the UK, where Bookshop operates. Though I’m thrilled that this will mean easier and greater support of independent bookstores in those areas, I’m more excited by the prospect of Page Match, which I previewed at a recent launch event in the company’s offices in New York. I’m the sort of person who reads the same title in its ebook, physical and audio forms. (I often wish that a purchase of a physical book came with free ebook and audio versions, but that’s besides the point.) While Kindles currently do a decent job of getting you to your latest page read across various devices, switching between, say, Martha Wells’ All Systems Red on Spotify and the paperback copy is not quite as easy. With Page Match, though, that should get a lot easier. How does Spotify Page Match work?When you get access to the feature (which is rolling out today), you’ll find the Page Match button under the title of each audiobook. You’ll have to first look up the book on Spotify and tap into its full chapter list to find this, which means the book you want to use has to be one of the hundreds of thousands in the company’s library. Then, tap the green “Scan to listen” button if you’re looking to move over to the audio version or “Scan to read” below it if you’re switching over to a hard copy instead. Whichever you pick, you’ll need to enable access to your device’s camera and then scan the page of the book you’re on. This should work on ereaders as well, and appears to be using some form of optical character recognition to match the part of the book to its audio counterpart.If you’re scanning to listen, the process is fairly straightforward. Once you’ve placed the page in the viewfinder, the app will quickly jump to that very spot in the chapter track. I’ll note that it was hard for me to confirm whether this actually worked during my first demo, since I never felt like I found the words being spoken on the page I was looking at. In this case, it was Lights Out: An Into Darkness novel by Navessa Allen, and I mostly felt like the narration had simply gone past the page I was on, rather than a complete failure. Subsequent attempts with other books, like Stephen King’s It, were more effective. Things get a bit trickier when you’re trying to move from audio book to the paper (or ereader). After pressing “Scan to read,” you’ll need to place a page in front of the camera and wait for it to tell you to move forward or backward. Ideally, you’d already know more or less where you were, so you won’t have to flip too many pages. In my demo, because we were a few chapters too far from where we paused in the early part of It, there was a lot more page-turning required to get to the right spot. What I found helpful was the progress bar at the bottom of the screen, which highlighted the correct location and how far away we were from it. The instructions “Move forward” and “Move back” were clear and came up in a timely manner.

          "content": "I have a love-hate relationship with Spotify that might just be leaning more towards love today. While I struggle with some of the company's choices about the type of content it allows on its platform, I have always had a soft spot for its Wrapped roundups and the monthly audiobook hours included with my Premium subscription. For those like me, Spotify’s news today will likely enhance the appeal of its audiobook offerings. It’s announcing a partnership with Bookshop.org — which lets indie bookstores sell their wares online through a unified platform — allowing users to buy physical books from within its app, and launching a new Page Match feature that helps sync your progress across the physical books you read and the audiobooks in Spotify’s catalog. Also, the audiobook recap feature that summarizes the plot so far is expanding to Android this spring, following its iOS debut (in beta form) last fall.Page Match is coming to all places where Spotify’s audiobooks are available, starting with the English language titles in its 500,000-strong library. Meanwhile, you can access Bookshop within the Spotify app in the US and the UK, where Bookshop operates. Though I’m thrilled that this will mean easier and greater support of independent bookstores in those areas, I’m more excited by the prospect of Page Match, which I previewed at a recent launch event in the company’s offices in New York. I’m the sort of person who reads the same title in its ebook, physical and audio forms. (I often wish that a purchase of a physical book came with free ebook and audio versions, but that’s besides the point.) While Kindles currently do a decent job of getting you to your latest page read across various devices, switching between, say, Martha Wells’ All Systems Red on Spotify and the paperback copy is not quite as easy. With Page Match, though, that should get a lot easier. How does Spotify Page Match work?When you get access to the feature (which is rolling out today), you’ll find the Page Match button under the title of each audiobook. You’ll have to first look up the book on Spotify and tap into its full chapter list to find this, which means the book you want to use has to be one of the hundreds of thousands in the company’s library. Then, tap the green “Scan to listen” button if you’re looking to move over to the audio version or “Scan to read” below it if you’re switching over to a hard copy instead. Whichever you pick, you’ll need to enable access to your device’s camera and then scan the page of the book you’re on. This should work on ereaders as well, and appears to be using some form of optical character recognition to match the part of the book to its audio counterpart.If you’re scanning to listen, the process is fairly straightforward. Once you’ve placed the page in the viewfinder, the app will quickly jump to that very spot in the chapter track. I’ll note that it was hard for me to confirm whether this actually worked during my first demo, since I never felt like I found the words being spoken on the page I was looking at. In this case, it was Lights Out: An Into Darkness novel by Navessa Allen, and I mostly felt like the narration had simply gone past the page I was on, rather than a complete failure. Subsequent attempts with other books, like Stephen King’s It, were more effective. Things get a bit trickier when you’re trying to move from audio book to the paper (or ereader). After pressing “Scan to read,” you’ll need to place a page in front of the camera and wait for it to tell you to move forward or backward. Ideally, you’d already know more or less where you were, so you won’t have to flip too many pages. In my demo, because we were a few chapters too far from where we paused in the early part of It, there was a lot more page-turning required to get to the right spot. What I found helpful was the progress bar at the bottom of the screen, which highlighted the correct location and how far away we were from it. The instructions “Move forward” and “Move back” were clear and came up in a timely manner. When we finally landed on the right page, the screen highlighted the specific lines on the page to start from, too. I have to caveat this with the observation that there were a few starts and stops during my demo, which were resolved once I established a solid internet connection.

          "standfirst": "Fast chargers are no longer a nice-to-have item. With phones, tablets, laptops and wearables all competing for outlets, the right charger can make a difference in how quickly you get back to full power without worrying about overheating or long-term battery wear. Since many devices now ship without a power brick, choosing a charger with the right compatibility, ports and charging technology is just as important as raw speed.Today’s best fast chargers are designed to handle multiple devices at once, whether that’s a phone, laptop, AirPods or even an Apple Watch. Many models combine Type-C ports with a USB-A charger option to support older cables like a Lightning cable, while newer designs focus on multi-port chargers that can intelligently distribute power across everything you plug in. Brands like Anker continue to refine their designs, with compact options such as an Anker charger that’s easy to toss in a bag but powerful enough for everyday use.With so many wattages, port layouts and standards to consider, finding the best fast charger depends on how and where you charge. Whether you want a simple wall adapter, a travel-friendly option or a desktop hub built to power everything at once, this guide breaks down our top picks for 2026. Best fast chargers for 2026 What to consider before buying a fast charger Before you start looking at specific chargers, it's critical to determine three things: how many devices do you need to charge, how much power do they require and whether or not you're planning on traveling with any of them. This is especially true if you’re charging a mix of devices that still rely on a Lightning cable alongside newer USB-C gear. The reason for the first question is simple. If you only need to charge a single device, like an iPhone or Android phone, it's cheaper and usually more space-efficient to get a lower-wattage phone charger with one port instead of two or three. Next, it's critical to figure out how much electricity your gadgets need because it doesn't make sense to buy a power brick that pushes out more juice than your device can actually use. This may sound a bit tricky, but most major manufacturers will list a product's max charging speeds in its tech specs, which is typically denoted by a specific wattage (15W, for example) or a quick-charge rating. Unfortunately, very powerful or large laptops like gaming notebooks can suck a ton of juice (more than 140 watts), which means they may rely on more traditional power adapters with barrel plugs. This may result in them not being compatible with universal chargers. Some of these PCs may also support charging over USB-C, so even if a specific adapter can't deliver its full power draw, it can still send over some energy — but it will do so at a slower rate compared to the laptop's included charger. To get the best performance, using a fast charging cable, such as a USB-C cable, can make a big difference in maintaining consistent power delivery. For frequent travelers, size and weight are often important considerations, because the bigger and heavier a charger is, the more annoying it will be to lug around. You'll also want to think about other factors like support for international plugs, which can be a big help to anyone who regularly visits other countries. If you’re already traveling with power banks or a charging station, choosing a compact GaN charger can help streamline your gear. Finally, you'll want to figure out if your smartphone uses a proprietary charging standard or if it's compatible with the USB Power Delivery spec (USB PD). For example, the OnePlus 13's included SuperVOOC power adapter can send up to 100 watts to the phone. However, if you use a generic USB-PD charger, speeds top out at 45 watts. That’s still pretty quick, but not nearly as fast as OnePlus' brick — and the same applies to devices with super fast charging support. Also, make sure your charging cable and connector are up to spec, as lower-quality accessories can bottleneck speeds or contribute to overheating during fast charging. Fast charger FAQs What is GaN? When looking for chargers, you may notice that some are marked as GaN, which stands for gallium nitride. This is an important distinction because, when compared to older adapters that use silicon switches, GaN-based devices support increased power efficiency and output, allowing manufacturers to create more compact bricks that run cooler and support higher wattages. Depending on the specific power output, GaN adapters can be 30 to 50 percent smaller and lighter than silicon-based alternatives. That might not sound like much, but when they’re sitting in a bag alongside a laptop and a half dozen other accessories you might have, cutting down on excess bulk and weight goes a long way. Do fast chargers affect battery life? Technically yes, because the process of sending a ton of watts into a gadget and potentially generating additional heat while doing so can decrease battery health over time. That said, modern devices and chargers use various protocols to ensure temperatures and power levels stay within preset limits — in large part to avoid damaging the product or creating a safety risk. At a base level, simply charging a gadget regardless of speed will cause degradation over time (nothing stays perfect forever, you know?). So as long as you use compatible chargers and cables, the impact of fast charging is generally quite negligible. What's the difference between a fast charger and a regular charger? There isn't a single generally accepted definition of fast charging. However, with power adapters capable of sending as little as five watts or less, it's important to know how much juice your device is getting, especially if you need to recharge something quickly. So depending on who you ask (particularly when it comes to smartphones), any charger that can push out more than 15 to 18 watts is generally considered to be \"fast.\" That said, with some phones capable of receiving more than 100 watts and up to 240 watts for some laptops, it's more important than ever to consider what devices you own before buying a new fast charger.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Cameras had an interesting year in 2025, with the launch of some long-delayed models like Sony’s 61MP RX1III, wholly original cameras (the Fujifilm X Half and Sigma BF) and much anticipated updates like the Sony A7 V and Canon R6 III. All told, there were 27 new cameras launched last year that joined the 20 new models on the market from 2024.Those ranged from compacts to mirrorless to very high-end models, with every price range included. The question is, which one is right for the type of videography or photography you do? Whether you’re an aspiring action or wildlife photographer, an extreme sports junkie or a content creator, we’ll help you find the perfect camera to match your budget and requirements. Best cameras for 2026 Best mirrorless cameras Mirrorless is the largest camera category in terms of models available, so it’s the best way to go if you’re looking for something with the most advanced features. Canon and Nikon recently announced they’re discontinuing development of new DSLRs, simply because most of the advantages of that category are gone, as I detailed in a video. The biggest selling feature of a mirrorless camera is the ability to change lenses depending on the type of shooting you want to do. Best action camera or gimbal camera The most important features to look for in an action cam are image quality, stabilization and battery life. GoPro has easily been beating all rivals recently in all those areas, but DJI has taken a lot of its business with the Osmo Pocket 3 gimbal camera. Best compact camera This category has fewer cameras than it did even a few years ago and many models are older, as manufacturers focus instead on mirrorless models. However, I’m still a big believer in compact cameras. They’re a noticeable step up from smartphones quality-wise, and a lot of people will take a compact traveling or to events when they’d never bother with the hassle of a DSLR or mirrorless camera. Compacts largely have type 1-inch sensors, but a few offer larger options, particularly Fujifilm’s XF-100V. Another popular model, Sony’s XV-1, is primarily aimed at content creators looking to step up. In any case, desirable qualities include image quality, a fast lens, relatively long zoom, flip-out display, good battery life, a high quality EVF, decent video and good pocketability. What to consider before choosing a camera Smartphones might get better for video and photos every year, full cameras still have an edge in many ways. The larger sensors in mirrorless cameras let more light in, and you have a wide choice of lenses with far superior optics. Dedicated cameras are also faster for shooting things like sports or wildlife, offer superior video for content creators and create more professional results. Sensor size There are a few key things to consider to get the most out of a camera. The first is sensor size: in general, the larger the sensor, the better (and usually more expensive) the camera. Full frame is the largest sensor size for mainstream cameras, and it’s available on models like the new Panasonic S9, the Nikon Z III and Canon EOS R5 II. At a size equivalent to 35mm film (36 x 24mm), it offers the best performance in terms of image quality, low-light capability and depth of field. But it’s also very expensive and finicky. While bokeh looks incredible at an aperture of f/1.4, the depth of field is so razor thin that your subject's eyebrow might be in focus but not their eye. This can also make shooting video difficult. The next size category is APS-C (around 23.5 x 15.6mm for most models and 22.2 x 14.8mm for Canon), offered on Fujifilm's X Series lineup, the Canon R10, the Sony ZV-E10 II and the Nikon Z50. It's cheaper than full frame, both for the camera body and lenses, but still brings most of the advantages like decent bokeh, high ISOs for low-light shooting and relatively high resolution. With a sensor size the same as movie cameras, it's ideal for shooting video, and it’s easier to hold focus than with full-frame cameras. Micro Four Thirds (17.3 x 13mm), a format shared by Panasonic and Olympus, is the next step down in sensor size. It offers less bokeh and light-gathering capability than APS-C and full frame, but allows for smaller and lighter cameras and lenses. For video, you can still get reasonably tight depth of field with good prime lenses, but focus is easier to control. The other common sensor size is Type 1 (1 inch), which is actually smaller than one inch at 12.7 x 9.5mm. That's used mostly by compact models like Sony’s ZV-1 vlogging camera. Finally, action cameras like the GoPro Hero 11 and DJI’s Osmo 3 have even smaller sensors (1/1.9 and 1/1.7 inches, respectively). Autofocus For photographers, another key factor is autofocus (AF) speed and accuracy. Most modern mirrorless cameras have hybrid phase-detect AF systems that allow for rapid focus and fast burst speeds. The majority also offer AI features like eye-detect AF for people and animals, which locks in on the subject’s eyes, face or body to keep them in focus. However, some models are faster and more reactive than others. Displays The electronic viewfinder (EVF) and rear display are also crucial. The best models have the sharpest and brightest EVFs that help you judge a shot before taking it. For things like street photography, it’s best to have as bright and sharp a rear display as possible, so it’s easy to see your subject and check focus in all manner of lighting conditions. You may also want a screen that flips out rather than just tilting, too. Lenses DSLRs and mirrorless cameras let you change lenses, but you're stuck with what's built into a compact camera. While that's great for portability, a single lens means you're going to sacrifice something along the way. The Fujifilm X100V, for instance, has a fast but fixed 35mm-equivalent f/2.0 lens and no zoom. The Sony RX100 V has a 24-70mm zoom, but it's slower at the telephoto end (f/2.8) and less sharp than a fixed focal (prime) lens. When choosing a lens for a mirrorless camera, you’ll need to consider the focal or zoom length, along with the minimum aperture. Smaller numbers like f/1.4 for a prime lens or f/2.8 for a zoom are best, as they let you work in darker environments and maximize background blur to isolate your subject. However, those lenses are more complex and thus more expensive. Video recording When it comes to video, there are other factors to consider. Some cameras combine or skip over pixels (line skipping or pixel binning) for video recording, which is not ideal because it can reduce sharpness. Better cameras tend to read out the entire sensor and then “downsample” to improve video sharpness (camera manufacturers don’t often say if video is pixel binned, but will say if it’s downsampled). Another important factor is sensor speed, as slower sensors tend to have more rolling shutter that can create a “jello” effect that skews video. In addition, how’s the battery life? How do you like the handling and feel? How long can you shoot before the camera heats up or stops? Does it support 10-bit HDR video? Is there a microphone and/or a headphone jack? (If you record a lot of interviews, it's preferable to have both.) How's the video autofocus? All of these things play a part in your decision.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-cameras-151524327.html?src=rss",

(If you record a lot of interviews, it's preferable to have both.) How's the video autofocus? All of these things play a part in your decision.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-cameras-151524327.html?src=rss",

But consultants on SAP projects face a different set of needs: navigating complex implementations, evolving best practices, and the pressure to deliver faster. They need timely, expert-level guidance. They need an AI partner that can deliver accurate SAP knowledge in an instant. Enter SAP Joule for Consultants, purpose-built to help system integrators and consulting teams drive smarter, faster outcomes for their clients.\"The consultant&#x27;s focus is not using our business applications — it’s to help implement those systems, perform upgrades, and at the largest scale, help our customers transform their on-premises SAP ERP to SAP Business Suite in the cloud,\" says Victor Alvarez, head of product marketing, Joule, at SAP. \"Acting as a knowledge-grounded AI teammate, SAP Joule for Consultants delivers trusted answers at critical moments, guides design decisions, and keeps projects aligned with SAP’s latest best practices.\"It can both compress timelines and improve project execution at every stage of delivery, resulting in a higher quality of service, he adds. \"Our customers want to complete their SAP projects as quickly as possible to realize the value of those initiatives sooner,\" Alvarez says. \"SAP Joule for Consultants puts the most accurate and up-to-date information at the fingertips of the consultants and system integrators performing these projects. It helps consultants decide and act with agility, reduce overall costs, and shorten project timelines without sacrificing quality.\"Building a better AI teammateAI is no longer an option in consulting. It’s reshaping how projects are designed, delivered, and scaled. For SAP consulting practices, this shift is especially pronounced as SAP cloud transformation and implementation projects demand deep knowledge and expertise. AI can help surface knowledge in seconds, making consultants more productive and improving project outcomes. As a result, practice leaders are not considering whether to use AI, but which AI solution to put at the core of their delivery model.What sets SAP Joule for Consultants apart is its underlying knowledge base. Any AI solution can generate an answer. What matters most is if the answer is accurate and can be trusted to guide project execution. SAP Joule for Consultants is grounded in SAP’s most authoritative, comprehensive, and up-to-date knowledge base. The knowledge base is expertly curated by SAP and includes exclusive content not available to third-party solutions or AI-enabled search engines. “We recognized an opportunity to help our partners transform their consulting practices with the most reliable AI assistance available,” Alvarez says. “We’ve leveraged our expertise and vast set of non-public customer enablement content to ground SAP Joule for Consultants with the most complete, accurate, and trustworthy knowledge.” For SAP consultants at every level Consultants at all experience levels have traditionally spent enormous time searching for information before they can take the next step — whether it’s making an architectural decision that shapes an entire implementation or solving a specific, tactical issue.All that research time is slashed to an extraordinary degree with SAP Joule for Consultants. By delivering expert-level answers drawn from a continually updated knowledge base, the solution helps consultants keep work moving and make smarter decisions that minimize rework.\"If you think about cloud transformation, there’s a huge return on investment,” Alvarez explains. “For SAP customers, this ROI goes beyond traditional cloud benefits to also unlock the AI innovations available in SAP Business Suite. SAP Joule for Consultants is part of our commitment to help our customers reduce time to value and achieve AI impact at scale.\"Enabling SAP customers tooThe solution isn&#x27;t just for consultants; it’s also for the IT departments within SAP customers. Organizations don’t have the luxury of engaging a consultant for every SAP project — sometimes the work needs to, or can be, done in-house. So, in the same way that SAP Joule for Consultants enables consultants with expert-level knowledge, internal IT teams can benefit from on-demand answers and guidance to accelerate internally staffed projects. \"They can use SAP Joule for Consultants to access the knowledge needed to take on more complex projects too,\" Alvarez says. \"That opens up more opportunity to engage system integrators on the more strategic and impactful projects.”IT teams also benefit from elevated collaboration with their consulting partners.

          "title": "The ‘brownie recipe problem’: why LLMs must have fine-grained context to deliver real-time results",
          "standfirst": "Today’s LLMs excel at reasoning, but can still struggle with context. This is particularly true in real-time ordering systems like Instacart. Instacart CTO Anirban Kundu calls it the \"brownie recipe problem.\"It&#x27;s not as simple as telling an LLM ‘I want to make brownies.’ To be truly assistive when planning the meal, the model must go beyond that simple directive to understand what’s available in the user’s market based on their preferences — say, organic eggs versus regular eggs — and factor that into what’s deliverable in their geography so food doesn’t spoil. This among other critical factors. For Instacart, the challenge is juggling latency with the right mix of context to provide experiences in, ideally, less than one second’s time. “If reasoning itself takes 15 seconds, and if every interaction is that slow, you&#x27;re gonna lose the user,” Kundu said at VentureBeat&#x27;s AI Impact event. Mixing reasoning, real-world state, personalizationIn grocery delivery, there’s a “world of reasoning” and a “world of state” (what’s available in the real world), Kundu noted, both of which must be understood by an LLM along with user preference. But it’s not as simple as loading the entirety of a user’s purchase history and known interests into a reasoning model. “Your LLM is gonna blow up into a size that will be unmanageable,” said Kundu. To get around this, Instacart splits processing into chunks. First, data is fed into a large foundational model that can understand intent and categorize products. That processed data is then routed to small language models (SLMs) designed for catalog context (the types of food or other items that work together) and semantic understanding. In the case of catalog context, the SLM must be able to process multiple levels of details around the order itself as well as the different products. For instance, what products go together and what are their relevant replacements if the first choice isn&#x27;t in stock? These substitutions are “very, very important” for a company like Instacart, which Kundu said has “over double digit cases” where a product isn’t available in a local market. In terms of semantic understanding, say a shopper is looking to buy healthy snacks for children. The model needs to understand what a healthy snack is and what foods are appropriate for, and appeal to, an 8 year old, then identify relevant products. And, when those particular products aren’t available in a given market, the model has to also find related subsets of products. Then there’s the logistical element. For example, a product like ice cream melts quickly, and frozen vegetables also don’t fare well when left out in warmer temperatures. The model must have this context and calculate an acceptable deliverability time. “So you have this intent understanding, you have this categorization, then you have this other portion about logistically, how do you do it?”, Kundu noted. Avoiding &#x27;monolithic&#x27; agent systemsLike many other companies, Instacart is experimenting with AI agents, finding that a mix of agents works better than a “single monolith” that does multiple different tasks. The Unix philosophy of a modular operating system with smaller, focused tools helps address different payment systems, for instance, that have varying failure modes, Kundu explained. “Having to build all of that within a single environment was very unwieldy,” he said. Further, agents on the back end talk to many third-party platforms, including point-of-sale (POS) and catalog systems. Naturally, not all of them behave the same way; some are more reliable than others, and they have different update intervals and feeds. “So being able to handle all of those things, we&#x27;ve gone down this route of microagents rather than agents that are dominantly large in nature,” said Kundu. To manage agents, Instacart has integrated with OpenAI’s model context protocol (MCP), which standardizes and simplifies the process of connecting AI models to different tools and data sources. The company also uses Google’s Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) open standard, which allows AI agents to directly interact with merchant systems. However, Kundu&#x27;s team still deals with challenges. As he noted, it&#x27;s not about whether integration is possible, but how reliably those integrations behave and how well they&#x27;re understood by users. Discovery can be difficult, not just in identifying available services, but understanding which ones are appropriate for which task.Instacart has had to implement MCP and UCP in “very different” cases, and the biggest problems they’ve run into are failure modes and latency, Kundu noted. “The response times and understandings of both of those services are very, very different I would say we spend probably two thirds of the time fixing those error cases.”",

          "title": "Mistral drops Voxtral Transcribe 2, an open-source speech model that runs on-device for pennies",
          "standfirst": "Mistral AI, the Paris-based startup positioning itself as Europe&#x27;s answer to OpenAI, released a pair of speech-to-text models on Wednesday that the company says can transcribe audio faster, more accurately, and far more cheaply than anything else on the market — all while running entirely on a smartphone or laptop.The announcement marks the latest salvo in an increasingly competitive battle over voice AI, a technology that enterprise customers see as essential for everything from automated customer service to real-time translation. But unlike offerings from American tech giants, Mistral&#x27;s new Voxtral Transcribe 2 models are designed to process sensitive audio without ever transmitting it to remote servers — a feature that could prove decisive for companies in regulated industries like healthcare, finance, and defense.\"You&#x27;d like your voice and the transcription of your voice to stay close to where you are, meaning you want it to happen on device—on a laptop, a phone, or a smartwatch,\" Pierre Stock, Mistral&#x27;s vice president of science operations, said in an interview with VentureBeat. \"We make that possible because the model is only 4 billion parameters. It&#x27;s small enough to fit almost anywhere.\"Mistral splits its new AI transcription technology into batch processing and real-time applicationsMistral released two distinct models under the Voxtral Transcribe 2 banner, each engineered for different use cases.Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2 handles batch transcription, processing pre-recorded audio files in bulk. The company says it achieves the lowest word error rate of any transcription service and is available via API at $0.003 per minute, roughly one-fifth the price of major competitors. The model supports 13 languages, including English, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi, and several European languages.Voxtral Realtime, as its name suggests, processes live audio with a latency that can be configured down to 200 milliseconds — the blink of an eye. Mistral claims this is a breakthrough for applications where even a two-second delay proves unacceptable: live subtitling, voice agents, and real-time customer service augmentation.The Realtime model ships under an Apache 2.0 open-source license, meaning developers can download the model weights from Hugging Face, modify them, and deploy them without paying Mistral a licensing fee. For companies that prefer not to run their own infrastructure, API access costs $0.006 per minute.Stock said Mistral is betting on the open-source community to expand the model&#x27;s reach. \"The open-source community is very imaginative when it comes to applications,\" he said. \"We&#x27;re excited to see what they&#x27;re going to do.\"Why on-device AI processing matters for enterprises handling sensitive dataThe decision to engineer models small enough to run locally reflects a calculation about where the enterprise market is heading. As companies integrate AI into ever more sensitive workflows — transcribing medical consultations, financial advisory calls, legal depositions — the question of where that data travels has become a dealbreaker.Stock painted a vivid picture of the problem during his interview. Current note-taking applications with audio capabilities, he explained, often pick up ambient noise in problematic ways: \"It might pick up the lyrics of the music in the background. It might pick up another conversation. It might hallucinate from a background noise.\"Mistral invested heavily in training data curation and model architecture to address these issues. \"All of that, we spend a lot of time ironing out the data and the way we train the model to robustify it,\" Stock said.The company also added enterprise-specific features that its American competitors have been slower to implement. Context biasing allows customers to upload a list of specialized terminology — medical jargon, proprietary product names, industry acronyms — and the model will automatically favor those terms when transcribing ambiguous audio. Unlike fine-tuning, which requires retraining the model, context biasing works through a simple API parameter.\"You only need a text list,\" Stock explained. \"And then the model will automatically bias the transcription toward these acronyms or these weird words. And it&#x27;s zero shots, no need for retraining, no need for weird stuff.\"From factory floors to call centers, Mistral targets high-noise industrial environmentsStock described two scenarios that capture how Mistral envisions the technology being deployed.The first involves industrial auditing. Imagine technicians walking through a manufacturing facility, inspecting heavy machinery while shouting observations over the din of factory noise. \"In the end, imagine like a perfect timestamped notes identifying who said what — so diarization — while being super robust,\" Stock said. The challenge is handling what he called \"weird technical language that no one is able to spell except these people.\"The second scenario targets customer service operations. When a caller contacts a support center, Voxtral Realtime can transcribe the conversation in real time, feeding text to backend systems that pull up relevant customer records before the caller finishes explaining the problem.\"The status will appear for the operator on the screen before the customer stops the sentence and stops complaining,\" Stock explained. \"Which means you can just interact and say, &#x27;Okay, I can see the status. Let me correct the address and send back the shipment.&#x27;\"He estimated this could reduce typical customer service interactions from multiple back-and-forth exchanges to just two interactions: the customer explains the problem, and the agent resolves it immediately.Real-time translation across languages could arrive by the end of 2026For all the focus on transcription, Stock made clear that Mistral views these models as foundational technology for a more ambitious goal: real-time speech-to-speech translation that feels natural.\"Maybe the end goal application and what the model is laying the groundwork for is live translation,\" he said. \"I speak French, you speak English. It&#x27;s key to have minimal latency, because otherwise you don&#x27;t build empathy. Your face is not out of sync with what you said one second ago.\"That goal puts Mistral in direct competition with Apple and Google, both of which have been racing to solve the same problem. Google&#x27;s latest translation model operates at a two-second delay — ten times slower than what Mistral claims for Voxtral Realtime.Mistral positions itself as the privacy-first alternative for enterprise customersMistral occupies an unusual position in the AI landscape. Founded in 2023 by alumni of Meta and Google DeepMind, the company has raised over $2 billion and now carries a valuation of approximately $13.6 billion. Yet it operates with a fraction of the compute resources available to American hyperscalers — and has built its strategy around efficiency rather than brute force.\"The models we release are enterprise grade, industry leading, efficient — in particular, in terms of cost — can be embedded into the edge, unlocks privacy, unlocks control, transparency,\" Stock said.That approach has resonated particularly with European customers wary of dependence on American technology. In January, France&#x27;s Ministry of the Armed Forces signed a framework agreement giving the country&#x27;s military access to Mistral&#x27;s AI models—a deal that explicitly requires deployment on French-controlled infrastructure.Data privacy remains one of the biggest barriers to voice AI adoption in the enterprise. For companies in sensitive industries — finance, manufacturing, healthcare, insurance — sending audio data to external cloud servers is often a non-starter. The information needs to stay either on the device itself or within the company&#x27;s own infrastructure.Mistral faces stiff competition from OpenAI, Google, and a rising ChinaThe transcription market has grown fiercely competitive. OpenAI&#x27;s Whisper model has become something of an industry standard, available both through API and as downloadable open-source weights. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft all offer enterprise-grade speech services. Specialized players like Assembly AI and Deepgram have built substantial businesses serving developers who need reliable, scalable transcription.Mistral claims its new models outperform all of them on accuracy benchmarks while undercutting them on price. \"We are better than them on the benchmarks,\" Stock said. Independent verification of those claims will take time, but the company points to performance on FLEURS, a widely used multilingual speech benchmark, where Voxtral models achieve word error rates competitive with or superior to alternatives from OpenAI and Google.Perhaps more significantly, Mistral&#x27;s CEO Arthur Mensch has warned that American AI companies face pressure from an unexpected direction. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, Mensch dismissed the notion that Chinese AI lags behind the West as \"a fairy tale.\"\"The capabilities of China&#x27;s open-source technology is probably stressing the CEOs in the US,\" he said.The French startup bets that trust will determine the winner in enterprise voice AIStock predicted that 2026 would be \"the year of note-taking\" — the moment when AI transcription becomes reliable enough that users trust it completely.\"You need to trust the model, and the model basically cannot make any mistake, otherwise you would just lose trust in the product and stop using it,\" he said. \"The threshold is super, super hard.\"Whether Mistral has crossed that threshold remains to be seen. Enterprise customers will be the ultimate judges, and they tend to move slowly, testing claims against reality before committing budgets and workflows to new technology. The audio playground in Mistral Studio, where developers can test Voxtral Transcribe 2 with their own files, went live today.But Stock&#x27;s broader argument deserves attention. In a market where American giants compete by throwing billions of dollars at ever-larger models, Mistral is making a different wager: that in the age of AI, smaller and local might beat bigger and distant. For the executives who spend their days worrying about data sovereignty, regulatory compliance, and vendor lock-in, that pitch may prove more compelling than any benchmark.The race to dominate enterprise voice AI is no longer just about who builds the most powerful model. It&#x27;s about who builds the model you&#x27;re willing to let listen.",

The model supports 13 languages, including English, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi, and several European languages.Voxtral Realtime, as its name suggests, processes live audio with a latency that can be configured down to 200 milliseconds — the blink of an eye. Mistral claims this is a breakthrough for applications where even a two-second delay proves unacceptable: live subtitling, voice agents, and real-time customer service augmentation.The Realtime model ships under an Apache 2.0 open-source license, meaning developers can download the model weights from Hugging Face, modify them, and deploy them without paying Mistral a licensing fee. For companies that prefer not to run their own infrastructure, API access costs $0.006 per minute.Stock said Mistral is betting on the open-source community to expand the model&#x27;s reach. \"The open-source community is very imaginative when it comes to applications,\" he said. \"We&#x27;re excited to see what they&#x27;re going to do.\"Why on-device AI processing matters for enterprises handling sensitive dataThe decision to engineer models small enough to run locally reflects a calculation about where the enterprise market is heading. As companies integrate AI into ever more sensitive workflows — transcribing medical consultations, financial advisory calls, legal depositions — the question of where that data travels has become a dealbreaker.Stock painted a vivid picture of the problem during his interview. Current note-taking applications with audio capabilities, he explained, often pick up ambient noise in problematic ways: \"It might pick up the lyrics of the music in the background. It might pick up another conversation. It might hallucinate from a background noise.\"Mistral invested heavily in training data curation and model architecture to address these issues. \"All of that, we spend a lot of time ironing out the data and the way we train the model to robustify it,\" Stock said.The company also added enterprise-specific features that its American competitors have been slower to implement. Context biasing allows customers to upload a list of specialized terminology — medical jargon, proprietary product names, industry acronyms — and the model will automatically favor those terms when transcribing ambiguous audio. Unlike fine-tuning, which requires retraining the model, context biasing works through a simple API parameter.\"You only need a text list,\" Stock explained. \"And then the model will automatically bias the transcription toward these acronyms or these weird words. And it&#x27;s zero shots, no need for retraining, no need for weird stuff.\"From factory floors to call centers, Mistral targets high-noise industrial environmentsStock described two scenarios that capture how Mistral envisions the technology being deployed.The first involves industrial auditing. Imagine technicians walking through a manufacturing facility, inspecting heavy machinery while shouting observations over the din of factory noise. \"In the end, imagine like a perfect timestamped notes identifying who said what — so diarization — while being super robust,\" Stock said. The challenge is handling what he called \"weird technical language that no one is able to spell except these people.\"The second scenario targets customer service operations. When a caller contacts a support center, Voxtral Realtime can transcribe the conversation in real time, feeding text to backend systems that pull up relevant customer records before the caller finishes explaining the problem.\"The status will appear for the operator on the screen before the customer stops the sentence and stops complaining,\" Stock explained. \"Which means you can just interact and say, &#x27;Okay, I can see the status. Let me correct the address and send back the shipment.&#x27;\"He estimated this could reduce typical customer service interactions from multiple back-and-forth exchanges to just two interactions: the customer explains the problem, and the agent resolves it immediately.Real-time translation across languages could arrive by the end of 2026For all the focus on transcription, Stock made clear that Mistral views these models as foundational technology for a more ambitious goal: real-time speech-to-speech translation that feels natural.\"Maybe the end goal application and what the model is laying the groundwork for is live translation,\" he said. \"I speak French, you speak English. It&#x27;s key to have minimal latency, because otherwise you don&#x27;t build empathy. Your face is not out of sync with what you said one second ago.\"That goal puts Mistral in direct competition with Apple and Google, both of which have been racing to solve the same problem. Google&#x27;s latest translation model operates at a two-second delay — ten times slower than what Mistral claims for Voxtral Realtime.Mistral positions itself as the privacy-first alternative for enterprise customersMistral occupies an unusual position in the AI landscape. Founded in 2023 by alumni of Meta and Google DeepMind, the company has raised over $2 billion and now carries a valuation of approximately $13.6 billion. Yet it operates with a fraction of the compute resources available to American hyperscalers — and has built its strategy around efficiency rather than brute force.\"The models we release are enterprise grade, industry leading, efficient — in particular, in terms of cost — can be embedded into the edge, unlocks privacy, unlocks control, transparency,\" Stock said.That approach has resonated particularly with European customers wary of dependence on American technology. In January, France&#x27;s Ministry of the Armed Forces signed a framework agreement giving the country&#x27;s military access to Mistral&#x27;s AI models—a deal that explicitly requires deployment on French-controlled infrastructure.Data privacy remains one of the biggest barriers to voice AI adoption in the enterprise. For companies in sensitive industries — finance, manufacturing, healthcare, insurance — sending audio data to external cloud servers is often a non-starter. The information needs to stay either on the device itself or within the company&#x27;s own infrastructure.Mistral faces stiff competition from OpenAI, Google, and a rising ChinaThe transcription market has grown fiercely competitive. OpenAI&#x27;s Whisper model has become something of an industry standard, available both through API and as downloadable open-source weights. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft all offer enterprise-grade speech services. Specialized players like Assembly AI and Deepgram have built substantial businesses serving developers who need reliable, scalable transcription.Mistral claims its new models outperform all of them on accuracy benchmarks while undercutting them on price. \"We are better than them on the benchmarks,\" Stock said. Independent verification of those claims will take time, but the company points to performance on FLEURS, a widely used multilingual speech benchmark, where Voxtral models achieve word error rates competitive with or superior to alternatives from OpenAI and Google.Perhaps more significantly, Mistral&#x27;s CEO Arthur Mensch has warned that American AI companies face pressure from an unexpected direction. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, Mensch dismissed the notion that Chinese AI lags behind the West as \"a fairy tale.\"\"The capabilities of China&#x27;s open-source technology is probably stressing the CEOs in the US,\" he said.The French startup bets that trust will determine the winner in enterprise voice AIStock predicted that 2026 would be \"the year of note-taking\" — the moment when AI transcription becomes reliable enough that users trust it completely.\"You need to trust the model, and the model basically cannot make any mistake, otherwise you would just lose trust in the product and stop using it,\" he said. \"The threshold is super, super hard.\"Whether Mistral has crossed that threshold remains to be seen. Enterprise customers will be the ultimate judges, and they tend to move slowly, testing claims against reality before committing budgets and workflows to new technology. The audio playground in Mistral Studio, where developers can test Voxtral Transcribe 2 with their own files, went live today.But Stock&#x27;s broader argument deserves attention. In a market where American giants compete by throwing billions of dollars at ever-larger models, Mistral is making a different wager: that in the age of AI, smaller and local might beat bigger and distant. For the executives who spend their days worrying about data sovereignty, regulatory compliance, and vendor lock-in, that pitch may prove more compelling than any benchmark.The race to dominate enterprise voice AI is no longer just about who builds the most powerful model. It&#x27;s about who builds the model you&#x27;re willing to let listen.",

          "standfirst": "Remote-first AI coding startup Kilo doesn&#x27;t think software developers should have to pledge their undying allegiance to any one development environment — and certainly not any one model or harness. This week, the startup — backed by GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij — unveiled Kilo CLI 1.0, a complete rebuild of its command-line tool that offers support for more than 500 different underlying AI models from proprietary leaders and open source rivals like Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen. It comes just weeks after Kilo launched a Slackbot allowing developers to ship code directly from Salesforce&#x27;s popular messaging service (Slack, which VentureBeat also uses) powered by the Chinese AI startup MiniMax. The release marks a strategic pivot away from the IDE-centric “sidebar” model popularized by industry giants like Cursor and GitHub Copilot, or dedicated apps like the new OpenAI Codex, and even terminal-based rivals like Codex CLI and Claude Code, aiming instead to embed AI capabilities into every fragment of the professional software workflow.By launching a model-agnostic CLI on the heels of its Slack bot, Kilo is making a calculated bet: the future of AI development isn’t about a single interface, but about tools that travel with the engineer between IDEs, terminals, remote servers, and team chat threads. In a recent interview with VentureBeat, Kilo CEO and co-founder Scott Breitenother explained the necessity of this fluidity: “This experience just feels a little bit too fragmented right now... as an engineer, sometimes I&#x27;m going to use the CLI, sometimes I&#x27;m going to be in VS Code, and sometimes I&#x27;m going to be kicking off an agent from Slack, and folks shouldn&#x27;t have to be jumping around.” He noted that Kilo CLI 1.0 is specifically “built for this world... for the developer who moves between their local IDE, a remote server via SSH, and a terminal session at 2 a.m. to fix a production bug.”Technology: Rebuilding for &#x27;Kilo Speed&#x27;Kilo CLI 1.0 is a fundamental architectural shift. While 2025 was the year senior engineers began to take AI vibe coding seriously, Kilo believes 2026 will be defined by the adoption of agents that can manage end-to-end tasks independently. The new CLI is built on an MIT-licensed, open-source foundation, specifically designed to function in terminal sessions where developers often find themselves during critical production incidents or deep infrastructure work.For Breitenother, building in the open is non-negotiable: “When you build in the open, you build better products. You get this great flywheel of contributors... your community is not just passive users. They&#x27;re actually part of your team that&#x27;s helping you develop your product... Honestly, some people might say open source is a weakness, but I think it&#x27;s our superpower.”The core of this “agentic” experience is Kilo’s ability to move beyond simple autocompletion. The CLI supports multiple operational modes:Code Mode: For high-speed generation and multi-file refactors.Architect Mode: For high-level planning and technical strategy.Debug Mode: For systematic problem diagnosis and resolution.Solving multi-session memoryTo solve the persistent issue of “AI amnesia”—where an agent loses context between sessions—Kilo utilizes a “Memory Bank” feature. This system maintains state by storing context in structured Markdown files within the repository, ensuring that an agent operating in the CLI has the same understanding of the codebase as the one working in a VS Code sidebar or a Slack thread. The synergy between the new CLI and “Kilo for Slack” is central to the company’s “Agentic Anywhere” strategy. Launched in January, the Slack integration allows teams to fix bugs and push pull requests directly from a conversation.Unlike competing integrations from Cursor or Claude Code —which Kilo claims are limited by single-repo configurations or a lack of persistent thread state — Kilo’s bot can ingest context from across multiple repositories simultaneously.“Engineering teams don&#x27;t make decisions in IDE sidebars. They make them in Slack,” Breitenother emphasized. Extensibility and the &#x27;superpower&#x27; of open sourceA critical component of Kilo’s technical depth is its support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This open standard allows Kilo to communicate with external servers, extending its capabilities beyond local file manipulation. Through MCP, Kilo agents can integrate with custom tools and resources, such as internal documentation servers or third-party monitoring tools, effectively turning the agent into a specialized member of the engineering team.This extensibility is part of Kilo’s broader commitment to model agnosticism. While MiniMax is the default for Slack, the CLI and extension support a massive array of over 500 models, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google Gemini. Pricing: The economy of &#x27;AI output per dollar&#x27;Kilo is also attempting to disrupt the economics of AI development with “Kilo Pass,” a subscription service designed for transparency. The company charges exact provider API rates with zero commission—$1 of Kilo credits is equivalent to $1 of provider costs.Breitenother is critical of the “black box” subscription models used by others in the space: “We&#x27;re selling infrastructure here... you hit some sort of arbitrary, unclear line, and then you start to get throttled. That&#x27;s not how the world&#x27;s going to work.” The Kilo Pass tiers offer “momentum rewards,” providing bonus credits for active subscribers:Starter ($19/mo): Up to $26.60 in credits.Pro ($49/mo): Up to $68.60 in credits.Expert ($199/mo): Up to $278.60 in credits.To incentivize early adoption, Kilo is currently offering a “Double Welcome Bonus” until February 6th, giving users 50% free credits for their first two months. For power users like Sylvain, this flexibility is a major draw: “Kilo Pass is exactly what I’ve been waiting for. I can use my credits when I need them and save them when I don’t—it finally fits how I actually use AI.”Community, security, and competitionThe arrival of Kilo CLI 1.0 places it in direct conversation with terminal-native heavyweights: Anthropic’s Claude Code and Block’s Goose. Outside of the terminal, in the more full featured IDE space, OpenAI recently launched a new Codex desktop app for macOS.Claude Code offers a highly polished experience, but it comes with vendor lock-in and high costs—up to $200 per month for tiers that still include token-based usage caps and rate limits. Independent analysis suggests these limits are often exhausted within minutes of intensive work on large codebases. OpenAI’s new Codex app similarly favors a platform-locked approach, functioning as a \"command center for agents\" that allows developers to supervise AI systems running independently for up to 30 minutes. While Codex introduces powerful features like \"Skills\" to connect to tools like Figma and Linear, it is fundamentally designed to defend OpenAI&#x27;s ecosystem in a highly contested market.Conversely, Kilo CLI 1.0 utilizes the MIT-licensed OpenCode foundation to deliver a production-ready Terminal User Interface (TUI) that allows engineers to swap between 500+ models. This portability allows teams to select the best cost-to-performance ratio—perhaps using a lightweight model for documentation but swapping to a frontier model for complex debugging.Regarding security, Kilo ensures that models are hosted on U.S.-compliant infrastructure like AWS Bedrock, allowing proprietary code to remain within trusted perimeters while leveraging the most efficient intelligence available.Goose provides an open-source alternative that runs entirely on a user&#x27;s local machine for free, but seems more localized and experimental. Kilo positions itself as the middle path: a production-hardened tool that maintains open-source transparency while providing the infrastructure to scale across an enterprise. This contrasts with the broader market&#x27;s dual-use concerns; while OpenAI builds sandboxes to secure autonomous agents, Kilo’s open-core nature allows for a \"superpower\" level of community auditing and contribution.The future: A &#x27;mech suit&#x27; for the mindWith $8 million in seed funding and a “Right of First Refusal” agreement with GitLab lasting until August 2026, Kilo is positioning itself as the backbone of the next-generation developer stack. Breitenother views these tools as “exoskeletons” or “mech suits” for the mind, rather than replacements for human engineers.“We&#x27;ve actually moved our engineers to be product owners,” Breitenother reveals. “The time they freed up from writing code, they&#x27;re actually doing much more thinking. They&#x27;re setting the strategy for the product.” By unbundling the engineering stack—separating the agentic interface from the model and the model from the IDE—Kilo provides a roadmap for a future where developers think architecturally while machines build the structure. “It&#x27;s the closest thing to magic that I think we can encounter in our life,” Breitenother concludes. For those seeking “Kilo Speed,” the IDE sidebar is just the beginning.",

          "title": "The best digital frames for 2026",
          "standfirst": "A digital photo frame shouldn’t be complicated. At its best, it’s just a good-looking screen that can be set up quickly that reliably shows the photos you care about. Unfortunately, that’s not always how things play out. The market is flooded with cheap digital frames that promise simplicity but end up delivering washed-out displays, clunky apps and a frustrating experience — leading you to abandon it after a week.That’s a shame, because a good digital frame can be really enjoyable. Most of us have thousands of photos sitting on our phones that never make it beyond the camera roll, even though they’re exactly the kind of moments worth seeing every day. A solid frame gives those images a permanent home, whether it’s family photos cycling in the living room or shared albums updating automatically for relatives across the country. We’ve tested a range of smart photo frames to separate the genuinely useful options from the forgettable junk, and these are the ones that are actually worth putting on display. Best digital picture frames for 2026 What to look for in digital picture frames While a digital photo frame feels like a simple piece of tech, there are a number of things I considered when trying to find one worth displaying in my home. First and foremost was screen resolution and size. I was surprised to learn that most digital photo frames have a resolution around 1,200 x 800, which feels positively pixelated. (That's for frames with screen sizes in the nine- to ten-inch range, which is primarily what I considered for this guide.) But after trying a bunch of frames, I realized that screen resolution is not the most important factor; my favorite photos looked best on frames that excelled in reflectivity, brightness, viewing angles and color temperature. A lot of these digital photo frames were lacking in one or more of these factors; they often didn't deal with reflections well or had poor viewing angles. A lot of frames I tested felt cheap and looked ugly as well, which isn’t something you want in a smart device that sits openly in your home. That includes lousy stands, overly glossy plastic parts and design decisions I can only describe as strange, particularly for items that are meant to just blend into your home. The best digital photo frames don't call attention to themselves and look like an actual “dumb” frame, so much so that those that aren’t so tech-savvy might mistake them for one. Perhaps the most important thing outside of the display, though, is the software. Let me be blunt: a number of frames I tested had absolutely atrocious companion apps and software experiences that I would not wish on anyone. One that I tried did not have a touchscreen, but did have an IR remote (yes, like the one you controlled your TV with 30 years ago). Trying to use that with a Wi-Fi connection was painful, and when I tried instead to use a QR code, I was linked to a Google search for random numbers instead of an actual app or website. I gave up on that frame, the $140 PixStar, on the spot. Other things were more forgivable. A lot of the frames out there are basically Android tablets with a bit of custom software slapped on the top, which worked fine but wasn't terribly elegant. And having to interact with the photo frame via touch wasn't great because you end up with fingerprints all over the display. The best frames I tried were smart about what features you could control on the frame itself vs. through an app, the latter of which is my preferred method. Another important software note: many frames I tried require subscriptions for features that absolutely should be included out of the box. For example, one frame would only let me upload 10 photos at a time without a subscription. Others would let you link a Google Photos account, but you could only sync a single album without paying up. Yet another option didn't let you create albums to organize the photos that were on the frame — it was just a giant scroll of photos with no way to give them order. While some premium frames offer perks like unlimited photos or cloud storage, they often come at a cost. I can understand why certain things might go under a subscription, like if you're getting a large amount of cloud storage, for example. But these subscriptions feel like ways for companies to make recurring revenue from a product made so cheaply they can't make any money on the frame itself. I'd urge you to make sure your chosen frame doesn't require a subscription (neither of the frames I recommend in this guide need a subscription for any of their features), especially if you plan on giving this device as a gift to loved ones. How much should you spend on a digital picture frame For a frame with a nine- or ten-inch display, expect to spend at least $100. Our budget recommendation is $99, and all of the options I tried that were cheaper were not nearly good enough to recommend. Spending $150 to $180 will get you a significantly nicer experience in all facets, from functionality to design to screen quality. Digital frames FAQs Are digital photo frames a good idea? Yes, as long as you know what to expect. A digital picture frame makes it easy to enjoy your favorite shots without printing them. They’re especially nice for families who want to display new photos quickly. The key is understanding the limitations. Some frames have lower resolution displays or need a constant Wi-Fi connection to work properly, so they’re not a perfect replacement for a high-quality print on the wall. But if you want a simple way to keep memories on display and up to date, they’re a solid choice. Can you upload photos to a digital frame from anywhere? Most modern digital frames let you do this, but it depends on the model. Many connect to Wi-Fi and use apps, cloud storage or email uploads, so you can add photos from your phone no matter where you are. Some even let family members share directly, which is great for keeping grandparents updated with new pictures.

          "content": "A digital photo frame shouldn’t be complicated. At its best, it’s just a good-looking screen that can be set up quickly that reliably shows the photos you care about. Unfortunately, that’s not always how things play out. The market is flooded with cheap digital frames that promise simplicity but end up delivering washed-out displays, clunky apps and a frustrating experience — leading you to abandon it after a week.That’s a shame, because a good digital frame can be really enjoyable. Most of us have thousands of photos sitting on our phones that never make it beyond the camera roll, even though they’re exactly the kind of moments worth seeing every day. A solid frame gives those images a permanent home, whether it’s family photos cycling in the living room or shared albums updating automatically for relatives across the country. We’ve tested a range of smart photo frames to separate the genuinely useful options from the forgettable junk, and these are the ones that are actually worth putting on display. Best digital picture frames for 2026 What to look for in digital picture frames While a digital photo frame feels like a simple piece of tech, there are a number of things I considered when trying to find one worth displaying in my home. First and foremost was screen resolution and size. I was surprised to learn that most digital photo frames have a resolution around 1,200 x 800, which feels positively pixelated. (That's for frames with screen sizes in the nine- to ten-inch range, which is primarily what I considered for this guide.) But after trying a bunch of frames, I realized that screen resolution is not the most important factor; my favorite photos looked best on frames that excelled in reflectivity, brightness, viewing angles and color temperature. A lot of these digital photo frames were lacking in one or more of these factors; they often didn't deal with reflections well or had poor viewing angles. A lot of frames I tested felt cheap and looked ugly as well, which isn’t something you want in a smart device that sits openly in your home. That includes lousy stands, overly glossy plastic parts and design decisions I can only describe as strange, particularly for items that are meant to just blend into your home. The best digital photo frames don't call attention to themselves and look like an actual “dumb” frame, so much so that those that aren’t so tech-savvy might mistake them for one. Perhaps the most important thing outside of the display, though, is the software. Let me be blunt: a number of frames I tested had absolutely atrocious companion apps and software experiences that I would not wish on anyone. One that I tried did not have a touchscreen, but did have an IR remote (yes, like the one you controlled your TV with 30 years ago). Trying to use that with a Wi-Fi connection was painful, and when I tried instead to use a QR code, I was linked to a Google search for random numbers instead of an actual app or website. I gave up on that frame, the $140 PixStar, on the spot. Other things were more forgivable. A lot of the frames out there are basically Android tablets with a bit of custom software slapped on the top, which worked fine but wasn't terribly elegant. And having to interact with the photo frame via touch wasn't great because you end up with fingerprints all over the display. The best frames I tried were smart about what features you could control on the frame itself vs. through an app, the latter of which is my preferred method. Another important software note: many frames I tried require subscriptions for features that absolutely should be included out of the box. For example, one frame would only let me upload 10 photos at a time without a subscription. Others would let you link a Google Photos account, but you could only sync a single album without paying up. Yet another option didn't let you create albums to organize the photos that were on the frame — it was just a giant scroll of photos with no way to give them order. While some premium frames offer perks like unlimited photos or cloud storage, they often come at a cost. I can understand why certain things might go under a subscription, like if you're getting a large amount of cloud storage, for example. But these subscriptions feel like ways for companies to make recurring revenue from a product made so cheaply they can't make any money on the frame itself. I'd urge you to make sure your chosen frame doesn't require a subscription (neither of the frames I recommend in this guide need a subscription for any of their features), especially if you plan on giving this device as a gift to loved ones. How much should you spend on a digital picture frame For a frame with a nine- or ten-inch display, expect to spend at least $100. Our budget recommendation is $99, and all of the options I tried that were cheaper were not nearly good enough to recommend. Spending $150 to $180 will get you a significantly nicer experience in all facets, from functionality to design to screen quality. Digital frames FAQs Are digital photo frames a good idea? Yes, as long as you know what to expect. A digital picture frame makes it easy to enjoy your favorite shots without printing them. They’re especially nice for families who want to display new photos quickly. The key is understanding the limitations. Some frames have lower resolution displays or need a constant Wi-Fi connection to work properly, so they’re not a perfect replacement for a high-quality print on the wall. But if you want a simple way to keep memories on display and up to date, they’re a solid choice. Can you upload photos to a digital frame from anywhere? Most modern digital frames let you do this, but it depends on the model. Many connect to Wi-Fi and use apps, cloud storage or email uploads, so you can add photos from your phone no matter where you are. Some even let family members share directly, which is great for keeping grandparents updated with new pictures. That said, a few budget models only work with USB drives or memory cards, so check how the frame handles uploads before buying.

          "standfirst": "Blizzard is running a series of showcases for several of its major franchises and on Wednesday, it was time for Overwatch to step up to the plate. That’s Overwatch, by the way, and not Overwatch 2. The studio is formally nixing the number from the game's name. \"Overwatch is more than just a digit: it's a living universe that keeps growing, keeps surprising, and keeps bringing players together from around the world,\" the Overwatch team said in a statement. \"This year marks a huge turning point in how the development team envisions the future of Overwatch, so we are officially dropping the '2' and moving forward as Overwatch.\"Blizzard made a big hullabaloo about Overwatch 2 being a sequel to the original game when it went live in October 2022 as part of a shift to a free-to-play model. There were a ton of major changes, not least a format switch from 6v6 to 5v5, with one tank being dropped from each team — a contentious decision that has been walked back with the return of 6v6 modes. The grand vision Blizzard originally had for Overwatch 2 never quite came together. The studio canceled its planned hero missions, which were going to have RPG-like talent trees and long-term progression, but it carried some of that DNA over to the Stadium mode. We only got one round of co-op story missions as well. That paid expansion reportedly sold poorly, leading Blizzard to scrap work on the player vs. environment elements of Overwatch to focus on the competitive player vs. player modes.Over the last couple of years, though, Blizzard really seems to have steadied the ship. Overwatch is arguably in the best shape it's been in for a long time. This is shaping up to be a big year for Overwatch. May will mark its 10th anniversary (I have to imagine the team has something significant planned for that). Blizzard laid out much of the roadmap for 2026 during the Overwatch Spotlight showcase. We won’t have to wait long at all to see significant changes to the game. New heroesWhen the next season goes live on February 10, it will be the biggest update to Overwatch at least since the Stadium mode and perks system went live last year, and arguably since the dawn of the Overwatch 2 era. That’s partly because Blizzard is adding five new heroes to the mix all at once next week. One of those is a character that the studio said in 2017 it had experimented with but ultimately, um, scratched. Jetpack Cat is alive after all, and is coming to Overwatch in a matter of days.This is a support hero with a permanent flight ability who can \"tow\" an ally, carrying them through the air while healing them. Jetpack Cat's ultimate ability sees the kitty diving into the ground to knock down enemies and tether the closest one to them, she can drag them toward a pit for an environmental kill, for instance. The ultimate is called Catnapper, which is delightful. Also, Jetpack Cat’s primary weapon is called Biotic Pawjectiles. I adore her already. It’s fun to see weird Wrecking Ball-type characters coming to Overwatch again. Blizzard EntertainmentThe other new heroes joining the fray next week are Domina (a zone-control tank with \"long-range precision\"), damage dealer Emre (a \"fast‑paced, mobile soldier archetype with conflicting identity due to cybernetic modification\"), Mizuki (a support who can throw a hat to heal allies) and Anran (a high-mobility hero who deals fire damage and can self-resurrect with their ultimate). As with Jetpack Cat, the latter of those is aligned with the Overwatch faction. You can try Anran out starting February 5 as part of a hero trial. The other three have ties to the villainous Talon organization. Expect another hero to join the fray every couple of months this year as each new season gets under way. That means more heroes will be added to Overwatch in 2026 than in any year since the game’s debut.A \"story-driven era\"Blizzard EntertainmentThe next season spells the beginning of what Blizzard is calling a \"new story-driven era\" for Overwatch, starting with a year-long narrative arc called The Reign of Talon. All of the lore, heroes, events and so on that emerge over the next 12 months will be tied to the rise of Talon. The studio says this is the \"the first fully connected annual storyline in Overwatch history.\" A new arc will begin next year with Season 1 of 2027 (Blizzard is resetting the season counter when The Reign of Talon begins).Elsewhere, each role will be split into sub-roles, and the heroes in each will share a passive ability. For instance, \"initiator\" tanks heal more while they're in the air, several damage heroes can detect enemies that are below half health through walls after damaging them and some supports have excess ultimate charge that carries over after you use their most powerful ability.Also on the way soon is a \"meta event\" called Conquest. This is billed as a faction war between Overwatch and Talon that will run for five weeks, with dozens of loot boxes and other rewards (such as some legendary Echo skins) up for grabs. Blizzard EntertainmentBlizzard has overhauled the Overwatch interface too, with updated menus, a new hero lobby, a notification hub and the promise of faster navigation. Stadium will have some updates, such as refreshed ability icons and recommended builds based on global data that will be updated between rounds. Vendetta is joining that mode's roster as well.Along with all the new heroes and other updates, a Hello Kitty collaboration will run for two weeks starting on February 10 with themed cosmetics for several heroes. Lots of other cosmetics are in the pipeline, including Crimson Wolf weapon skins you can unlock using competitive points, and rainy day and Valentine's items. Shop items from the last six seasons are going into loot boxes, while mythic cosmetics for Mercy, Juno and Mei will be available in Season 1.Blizzard EntertainmentLooking further ahead, a Nintendo Switch 2 version of Overwatch will arrive alongside Season 2, which will start in April. Some heroes will be getting their second mythic skins, including Ana and Genji. Genji, Hanzo and Sojourn will have mythic weapon skins in the coming months. Two new maps, including a Japan Night one, for the main modes are coming, along with the return of post-match accolades. There’s so much on the way for my go-to game. I don't know how I'm going to be able to take a long-enough break from Overwatch to play cool indies ever again.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/overwatch-will-drop-the-2-as-jetpack-cat-and-four-other-heroes-arrive-on-february-10-184500327.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "The groundhog has predicted six more weeks of winter, which means more time indoors on our devices — and that means it's a great time to improve your cybersecurity. By subscribing to a virtual private network (VPN) and connecting every time you get online, you can keep your activity hidden from your ISP and any advertisers it may sell that data to — all while streaming sporting events and TV dramas from all across the globe. We strongly recommend using a VPN, but shopping for one takes some care. If you jump on the very first deal you see, you might get stuck with a substandard app. It's also easy to end up paying more than you meant to, since otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be. Even with all those caveats, there are some great bargains on the table. Many of the best VPNs — including our top pick, Proton VPN — have deals that save you anywhere from 70 to 87 percent on annual subscriptions. If you can believe it, there are even Valentine's Day sales running right now, because nothing is more romantic than taking care of your online privacy. Best VPN deals ExpressVPN Basic — $68.40 for a two-year subscription with four months free (81 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This discount, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 81 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price. ExpressVPN Advanced — $88.00 for a two-year subscription with four months free (77 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. As above, note that it renews at $119.95 annually. NordVPN Basic — $64.56 for a two-year subscription (76 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. NordVPN includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This deal gives you 70 percent off the two-year plan, but note that it renews at $139.08 per year. NordVPN Plus — $76.56 for a two-year subscription (78 percent off): NordVPN has also taken 70 percent off its Plus subscription. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. When this plan renews, you'll be paying $179.88 per year. Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark One — $61.83 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with four months free (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 28 months of CyberGhost for 79 percent off the usual price, but it'll renew at $56.94 per year. hide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. Windscribe — $69 for a one-year subscription (32 percent off): It's not nearly as steep a discount as some of the others on this list, but Windscribe was cheap to begin with, so 32 percent off its monthly price is a bigger savings than it might seem. As I just covered in a detailed Windscribe review, it's worth upgrading from the free service to get full access to Windscribe's all-real server network (and remove the free plan's data cap). Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. You can also get a shorter one-year subscription for $40 ($3.33 per month). Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. What makes a good VPN deal Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with four months free (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 28 months of CyberGhost for 79 percent off the usual price, but it'll renew at $56.94 per year. hide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. Windscribe — $69 for a one-year subscription (32 percent off): It's not nearly as steep a discount as some of the others on this list, but Windscribe was cheap to begin with, so 32 percent off its monthly price is a bigger savings than it might seem. As I just covered in a detailed Windscribe review, it's worth upgrading from the free service to get full access to Windscribe's all-real server network (and remove the free plan's data cap). Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. You can also get a shorter one-year subscription for $40 ($3.33 per month). Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. What makes a good VPN deal Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

          "title": "X's 'open source' algorithm isn't a win for transparency, researchers say",
          "standfirst": "When X's engineering team published the code that powers the platform's \"for you\" algorithm last month, Elon Musk said the move was a victory for transparency. \"We know the algorithm is dumb and needs massive improvements, but at least you can see us struggle to make it better in real-time and with transparency,\" Musk wrote. \"No other social media companies do this.\" While it's true that X is the only major social network to make elements of its recommendation algorithm open source, researchers say that what the company has published doesn't offer the kind of transparency that would actually be useful for anyone trying to understand how X works in 2026. The code, much like an earlier version published in 2023, is a \"redacted\" version of X's algorithm, according to John Thickstun, an assistant professor of computer science at Cornell University. \"What troubles me about these releases is that they give you a pretense that they're being transparent for releasing code and the sense that someone might be able to use this release to do some kind of auditing work or oversight work,\" Thickstun told Engadget. \"And the fact is that that's not really possible at all.\"Predictably, as soon as the code was released, users on X began posting lengthy threads about what it means for creators hoping to boost their visibility on the platform. For example, one post that was viewed more than 350,000 times advises users that X \"will reward people who conversate\" and \"raise the vibrations of X.\" Another post with more than 20,000 views claims that posting video is the answer. Another post says that users should stick to their \"niche\" because \"topic switching hurts your reach.\" But Thickstun cautioned against reading too much into supposed strategies for going viral. \"They can't possibly draw those conclusions from what was released,\" he says. While there are some small details that shed light on how X recommends posts — for example, it filters out content that's more than a day old — Thickstun says that much of it is \"not actionable\" for content creators. Structurally, one of the biggest differences between the current algorithm and the version released in 2023 is that the new system relies on a Grok-like large language model to rank posts. \"In the previous version, this was hard coded: you took how many times something was liked, how many times something was shared, how many times something was replied … and then based on that you calculate a score, and then you rank the post based on the score,\" explains Ruggero Lazzaroni, a pHD researcher at the University of Graz. \"Now the score is derived not by the real amounts of likes and shares, but by how likely Grok thinks that you would like and share a post.\"That also makes the algorithm even more opaque than it was before, says Thickstun. \"So much more of the decisionmaking … is happening within black box neural networks that they're training on their data,\" he says. \"More and more of the decisionmaking power of these algorithms is shifting not just out of public view, but actually really out of view or understanding of even the internal engineers that are working on these systems, because they're being shifted into these neural networks.\"The release has even less detail about some aspects of the algorithm that were made public in 2023. At the time, the company included information about how it weighted various interactions to determine which posts should rank higher. For example, a reply was \"worth\" 27 retweets and a reply that generated a response from the original author was worth 75 retweets. But X has now redacted information about how it's weighing these factors, saying that this information was excluded \"for security reasons.\" The code also doesn't include any information about the data the algorithm was trained on, which could help researchers and others understand it or conduct audits. \"One of the things I would really want to see is, what is the training data that they're using for this model,\" says Mohsen Foroughifar, an assistant professor of business technologies at Carnegie Mellon University. \"if the data that is used for training this model is inherently biased, then the model might actually end up still being biased, regardless of what kind of things that you consider within the model.\" Being able to conduct research on the X recommendation algorithm would be extremely valuable, says Lazzaroni, who is working on an EU-funded project exploring alternative recommendation algorithms for social media platforms. Much of Lazzaroni's work involves simulating real-world social media platforms to test different approaches. But he says the code released by X doesn't have enough information to actually reproduce its recommendation algorithm. \"We have the code to run the algorithm, but we don't have the model that you need to run the algorithm,\" he says.If researchers were able to study the X algorithm, it could yield insights that could impact more than just social media platforms. Many of the same questions and concerns that have been raised about how social media algorithms behave are likely to re-emerge in the context of AI chatbots.\"A lot of these challenges that we're seeing on social media platforms and the recommendation [systems] appear in a very similar way with these generative systems as well,\" Thickstun said. \"So you can kind of extrapolate forward the kinds of challenges that we've seen with social media platforms to the kind of challenges that we'll see with interaction with GenAI platforms.\"Lazzaroni, who spends a lot of time simulating some of the most toxic behavior on social media, is even more blunt. \"AI companies, to maximize profit, optimize the large language models for user engagement and not for telling the truth or caring about the mental health of the users. And this is the same exact problem: they make more profit, but the users get a worse society, or they get worse mental health out of it.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xs-open-source-algorithm-isnt-a-win-for-transparency-researchers-say-181836233.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2026: Everything we're expecting from the S26 launch",
          "standfirst": "Samsung’s 2025 was filled with new foldables, an ultra-thin new form factor and the launch of Google's XR platform. After making some announcements at CES 2026, the company is expected to host its first Galaxy Unpacked of the year in February to introduce the Galaxy S26 lineup. Official invites have yet to be shared, but the date is widely expected to be near the end of the month, probably on February 25 But as usual, we know a lot about what’s expected when Samsung does hold its next event.Whenever it does happen, Engadget will be covering Galaxy Unpacked live, and we'll most likely have hands-on coverage of Samsung's new smartphones soon after they're announced. While we wait for an official invite, here's everything we expect Samsung will introduce at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026.What is Unpacked 2026 taking place?But first, when is Unpacked going to happen? A recent image shared by leakster Evan Blass indicated Unpacked should be taking place on “February 25 2026.” Blass has a long history of credible leaks, which means this date is all but confirmed, and the main questions remaining would be — what time and in what timezone? We’re still waiting on Samsung for the official details, which should include answers to those questions.Galaxy S26, S26+ and S26 UltraSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on photoPhoto by Sam Rutherford/EngadgetSamsung's restrained approach to updating its phones will likely continue with the Galaxy S26. Based on leaked images of the new lineup, the company is not expected to radically reinvent the look of the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ or Galaxy S26 Ultra, and instead will stick with a similar design to what it used on the Galaxy S25. The phones will have a flat front screen and frame, with rounded corners and cameras housed in a vertical pill-shaped plateau on the back. Unlike Apple's move from the iPhone 16 Pro to the iPhone 17 Pro, the biggest difference here will likely be internal components like the screens, chips and camera sensors Samsung uses.Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip is expected to be in all Samsung Galaxy S26 phones, though Korean news site Yonhap News reports Samsung's relatively new Exynos 2600 chip could be used in some phones in the lineup depending on the region, a strategy Samsung has deployed in the past. Either way the new phones should be more performant than the previous generation, and in the case of the models with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, particularly good at on-device AI processing.I have compiled the most accurate comprehensive parameter comparison of Galaxy S25, S25+ and Galaxy S26、 S26+. Which one do you want to buy? pic.twitter.com/aQpoSvYjOz— Ice Universe (@UniverseIce) November 29, 2025One notable difference between the Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S25 could be the phone's screen. The new phone will reportedly feature a 6.3-inch FHD+ display according to specs shared by leaker Ice Universe, which makes it ever so slightly larger than the 6.2-inch display used on the Galaxy S25. The S26 will also allegedly come with 12GB of RAM, either 256GB or 512GB of storage and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery. Samsung isn't changing the cameras on the entry-level phone, though: leaks suggest it'll feature the same 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie camera as the previous generation. Changes appear to be even more minor on the Galaxy S26+. Other than the new Snapdragon chip, the phone will reportedly feature the same 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 4,900mAh battery, 12GB of RAM and the same camera array used on the base Galaxy S26.The difference between the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra is reportedly a bit clearer. According to Android Headlines, the new phone's cameras will be slightly more raised, and stand out thanks to a new metallic finish. Samsung may also switch back to using an aluminum frame on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, after using titanium frames on both the Galaxy S24 and S25 Ultras. Most importantly, to make the phone actually support Qi2 rather than only technically work with the standard when a case is attached, rumors suggest Samsung will remove the S Pen digitizer layer in the phone and adopt a new method for accepting stylus input. It's not clear what that new method will actually be, but it could let the Galaxy S26 Ultra more easily work with Qi2 accessories without losing its stylus.Android Headlines also recently shared what appear to be full image renders of the S26 series, and they generally line up with what has already been rumored, leaked and reported so far. If these pictures are accurate, they give us a clearer look at the camera bump and two color variants of the S26 Ultra.Fans of magnets may continue to be disappointed by Samsung if the latest rumors are accurate. Despite the launch of the Qi 2 wireless charging standard adding support for convenient magnetic alignment years ago, Samsung has yet to bring that feature to its phones. Though the S-series have the higher speed charging rates that the spec enables, Nieuwemobiel.nl is reporting that, due to images it received of cases with magnetic rings, the S26 series likely won’t have built-in magnets. Samsung has made these cases to add the magnetic capability to its S-series in the past, and the existence of the images of these accessories lends weight to the idea that the company will continue this approach.Galaxy Buds 4Galaxy Buds 3 Pro in case.EngadgetSamsung released the Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro in 2024, with a major redesign that brought them much more in line with Apple's AirPods. The Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro Samsung is rumored to be announcing soon won't necessarily change that, though they will feature a more compact case and less angular stems, according to leaked images from the Samsung Tips app.Support for head gestures to accept and decline calls, a feature Apple includes on the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4, is also rumored to work on both versions of the new Galaxy Buds. SamMobile reports the Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro may also ship with a new Ultra Wideband chip that will make them easier to find with Google's Find Hub network.Galaxy Z TrifoldYes, the TriFold has a crease, two in fact. But they still don't ruin the experience. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetSamsung announced the Galaxy Z TriFold in late 2025 without firm details of when the new smartphone-that-folds-into-a-tablet would be available in North America. That info came on January 27, when the company announced the TriFold would be available in the US on January 30, for a whopping $2,900. Considering we’ve already seen the device in person at CES 2026 and people are most likely to have had a chance to look at, if not buy the foldable for themselves by the time Unpacked rolls around, we don’t expect Samsung to spend too much time dwelling on it, if at all.Galaxy S26 EdgeAt just 5.8mm thick, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is one of the thinnest smartphones ever made. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetWhen the Galaxy S25 Edge was announced in 2025, it seemed possible that Samsung could replace its \"Plus\" smartphone with a unique form factor, just like Apple has opted to do with the iPhone Air. There have been conflicting reports on the matter, but it seems like Samsung will not be doing that with the Galaxy S26 Edge.Instead, the smartphone will reportedly remain another option, much like foldables are for customers not swayed by Samsung's traditional smartphones. The Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to feature a slightly different design than last year's model, according to Android Headlines, with a large rectangular camera plateau that's reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones, and the raised oval Apple used on the iPhone Air. Beyond that, the phone is also expected to be ever so slightly thinner at 5.5mm than the 5.8mm Galaxy S25 Edge.Bixby and other AI featuresSamsung already acts as a first place Google can show off new AI features for Android, but the company is reportedly exploring other AI partnerships, too. In June 2025, Bloomberg reported that Samsung was nearing a deal with Perplexity to integrate its AI-powered search engine across OneUI and its homegrown mobile browser. Perplexity already has a deal with Motorola on its Razr phones, so the only thing that would make a deal with Samsung unusual is the close relationship the company already has with Google.The company also accidentally announced a new version of its Bixby AI assistant, which will likely also be integrated with Perplexity and could serve as an alternative to Google Gemini. Both a new Bixby and a deeper integration with Perplexity seem like natural new software features to show off at Galaxy Unpacked.Update, January 27 2026, 11:55AM ET: This story has been updated to reflect the latest news around the Galaxy Z TriFold’s price and availability in the US.Update, January 30 2026, 12:45PM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks on the possible dates for Unpacked 2026.Update, February 02 2026, 11:30AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks with full image renders of the S26 trio of devices.Update, February 03 2026, 11:00AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks about the possible lack of magnetic support on the S26 series.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-the-s26-launch-130000556.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Samsung’s 2025 was filled with new foldables, an ultra-thin new form factor and the launch of Google's XR platform. After making some announcements at CES 2026, the company is expected to host its first Galaxy Unpacked of the year in February to introduce the Galaxy S26 lineup. Official invites have yet to be shared, but the date is widely expected to be near the end of the month, probably on February 25 But as usual, we know a lot about what’s expected when Samsung does hold its next event.Whenever it does happen, Engadget will be covering Galaxy Unpacked live, and we'll most likely have hands-on coverage of Samsung's new smartphones soon after they're announced. While we wait for an official invite, here's everything we expect Samsung will introduce at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026.What is Unpacked 2026 taking place?But first, when is Unpacked going to happen? A recent image shared by leakster Evan Blass indicated Unpacked should be taking place on “February 25 2026.” Blass has a long history of credible leaks, which means this date is all but confirmed, and the main questions remaining would be — what time and in what timezone? We’re still waiting on Samsung for the official details, which should include answers to those questions.Galaxy S26, S26+ and S26 UltraSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on photoPhoto by Sam Rutherford/EngadgetSamsung's restrained approach to updating its phones will likely continue with the Galaxy S26. Based on leaked images of the new lineup, the company is not expected to radically reinvent the look of the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ or Galaxy S26 Ultra, and instead will stick with a similar design to what it used on the Galaxy S25. The phones will have a flat front screen and frame, with rounded corners and cameras housed in a vertical pill-shaped plateau on the back. Unlike Apple's move from the iPhone 16 Pro to the iPhone 17 Pro, the biggest difference here will likely be internal components like the screens, chips and camera sensors Samsung uses.Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip is expected to be in all Samsung Galaxy S26 phones, though Korean news site Yonhap News reports Samsung's relatively new Exynos 2600 chip could be used in some phones in the lineup depending on the region, a strategy Samsung has deployed in the past. Either way the new phones should be more performant than the previous generation, and in the case of the models with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, particularly good at on-device AI processing.I have compiled the most accurate comprehensive parameter comparison of Galaxy S25, S25+ and Galaxy S26、 S26+. Which one do you want to buy? pic.twitter.com/aQpoSvYjOz— Ice Universe (@UniverseIce) November 29, 2025One notable difference between the Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S25 could be the phone's screen. The new phone will reportedly feature a 6.3-inch FHD+ display according to specs shared by leaker Ice Universe, which makes it ever so slightly larger than the 6.2-inch display used on the Galaxy S25. The S26 will also allegedly come with 12GB of RAM, either 256GB or 512GB of storage and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery. Samsung isn't changing the cameras on the entry-level phone, though: leaks suggest it'll feature the same 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie camera as the previous generation. Changes appear to be even more minor on the Galaxy S26+. Other than the new Snapdragon chip, the phone will reportedly feature the same 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 4,900mAh battery, 12GB of RAM and the same camera array used on the base Galaxy S26.The difference between the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra is reportedly a bit clearer. According to Android Headlines, the new phone's cameras will be slightly more raised, and stand out thanks to a new metallic finish. Samsung may also switch back to using an aluminum frame on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, after using titanium frames on both the Galaxy S24 and S25 Ultras. Most importantly, to make the phone actually support Qi2 rather than only technically work with the standard when a case is attached, rumors suggest Samsung will remove the S Pen digitizer layer in the phone and adopt a new method for accepting stylus input. It's not clear what that new method will actually be, but it could let the Galaxy S26 Ultra more easily work with Qi2 accessories without losing its stylus.Android Headlines also recently shared what appear to be full image renders of the S26 series, and they generally line up with what has already been rumored, leaked and reported so far. If these pictures are accurate, they give us a clearer look at the camera bump and two color variants of the S26 Ultra.Fans of magnets may continue to be disappointed by Samsung if the latest rumors are accurate. Despite the launch of the Qi 2 wireless charging standard adding support for convenient magnetic alignment years ago, Samsung has yet to bring that feature to its phones. Though the S-series have the higher speed charging rates that the spec enables, Nieuwemobiel.nl is reporting that, due to images it received of cases with magnetic rings, the S26 series likely won’t have built-in magnets. Samsung has made these cases to add the magnetic capability to its S-series in the past, and the existence of the images of these accessories lends weight to the idea that the company will continue this approach.Galaxy Buds 4Galaxy Buds 3 Pro in case.EngadgetSamsung released the Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro in 2024, with a major redesign that brought them much more in line with Apple's AirPods. The Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro Samsung is rumored to be announcing soon won't necessarily change that, though they will feature a more compact case and less angular stems, according to leaked images from the Samsung Tips app.Support for head gestures to accept and decline calls, a feature Apple includes on the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4, is also rumored to work on both versions of the new Galaxy Buds. SamMobile reports the Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro may also ship with a new Ultra Wideband chip that will make them easier to find with Google's Find Hub network.Galaxy Z TrifoldYes, the TriFold has a crease, two in fact. But they still don't ruin the experience. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetSamsung announced the Galaxy Z TriFold in late 2025 without firm details of when the new smartphone-that-folds-into-a-tablet would be available in North America. That info came on January 27, when the company announced the TriFold would be available in the US on January 30, for a whopping $2,900. Considering we’ve already seen the device in person at CES 2026 and people are most likely to have had a chance to look at, if not buy the foldable for themselves by the time Unpacked rolls around, we don’t expect Samsung to spend too much time dwelling on it, if at all.Galaxy S26 EdgeAt just 5.8mm thick, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is one of the thinnest smartphones ever made. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetWhen the Galaxy S25 Edge was announced in 2025, it seemed possible that Samsung could replace its \"Plus\" smartphone with a unique form factor, just like Apple has opted to do with the iPhone Air. There have been conflicting reports on the matter, but it seems like Samsung will not be doing that with the Galaxy S26 Edge.Instead, the smartphone will reportedly remain another option, much like foldables are for customers not swayed by Samsung's traditional smartphones. The Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to feature a slightly different design than last year's model, according to Android Headlines, with a large rectangular camera plateau that's reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones, and the raised oval Apple used on the iPhone Air. Beyond that, the phone is also expected to be ever so slightly thinner at 5.5mm than the 5.8mm Galaxy S25 Edge.Bixby and other AI featuresSamsung already acts as a first place Google can show off new AI features for Android, but the company is reportedly exploring other AI partnerships, too. In June 2025, Bloomberg reported that Samsung was nearing a deal with Perplexity to integrate its AI-powered search engine across OneUI and its homegrown mobile browser. Perplexity already has a deal with Motorola on its Razr phones, so the only thing that would make a deal with Samsung unusual is the close relationship the company already has with Google.The company also accidentally announced a new version of its Bixby AI assistant, which will likely also be integrated with Perplexity and could serve as an alternative to Google Gemini.

          "standfirst": "Apple’s long-rumored foldable iPhone hasn’t been announced yet, but after years of speculation, it seems like this device could finally be coming out soon(ish). Multiple sources claim that Apple could be targeting a late-2026 launch for its first foldable phone, and new rumors suggest the company is even already thinking about its second model, which could be a clamshell-style foldable iPhone.But of course, nothing is official yet. Plans can change, features can be dropped and timelines can slip. Still, recent reports paint the clearest picture yet of how Apple might approach a foldable iPhone and how it plans to differentiate itself from rivals like Samsung and Google.Here, we’ve rounded up the most credible iPhone Fold rumors so far, covering its possible release timing, design, display technology, cameras and price. We’ll continue to update this post as more rumors and details become available.When could the iPhone Fold launch?Rumors of a foldable iPhone date back as far as 2017, but more recent reporting suggests Apple has finally locked onto a realistic window. Most sources now point to fall 2026, likely alongside the iPhone 18 lineup.Mark Gurman has gone back and forth on timing, initially suggesting Apple could launch “as early as 2026,” before later writing that the device would ship at the end of 2026 and sell primarily in 2027. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also repeatedly cited the second half of 2026 as Apple’s target.Some reports still claim the project could slip into 2027 if Apple runs into manufacturing or durability issues, particularly around the hinge or display. Given Apple’s history of delaying products that it feels aren’t ready, that remains a real possibility.What will the iPhone Fold look like?Current consensus suggests Apple has settled on a book-style foldable design, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, rather than a clamshell flip phone.When unfolded, the iPhone Fold is expected to resemble a small tablet like the iPad mini (8.3 inches). Based on the rumor mill, though, the iPhone Fold may be a touch smaller, with an internal display measuring around 7.7 to 7.8 inches. When closed, it should function like a conventional smartphone, with an outer display in the 5.5-inch range.CAD leaks and alleged case-maker molds suggest the device may be shorter and wider than a standard iPhone when folded, creating a squarer footprint that better matches the aspect ratio of the inner display. Several reports have also pointed to the iPhone Air as a potential preview of Apple’s foldable design work, with its unusually thin chassis widely interpreted as a look at what one half of a future foldable iPhone could resemble.If that theory holds, it could help explain the Fold’s rumored dimensions. Thickness is expected to land between roughly 4.5 and 5.6mm when unfolded, putting it in a similar range to the iPhone Air, and just over 9 to 11mm when folded, depending on the final hinge design and internal layering.iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone AirEngadgetDisplay and the crease questionThe display is arguably the biggest challenge for any foldable phone, and it’s an area where Apple appears to have invested years of development.Multiple reports say Apple will rely on Samsung Display as its primary supplier. At CES 2026, Samsung showcased a new crease-less foldable OLED panel, which several sources — including Bloomberg — suggested could be the same technology Apple plans to use.According to these reports, the panel combines a flexible OLED with a laser-drilled metal support plate that disperses stress when folding. The goal is a display with a nearly invisible crease, something Apple reportedly considers essential before entering the foldable market.If Apple does use this panel, it would mark a notable improvement over current foldables, which still show visible creasing under certain lighting conditions.Cameras and biometricsCamera rumors suggest Apple is planning a four-camera setup. That may include:Two rear cameras (main and ultra-wide, both rumored at 48MP)One punch-hole camera on the outer displayOne under-display camera on the inner screenSeveral sources claim Apple will avoid Face ID entirely on the iPhone Fold. Instead, it’s expected to rely on Touch ID built into the power button, similar to recent iPad models. This would allow Apple to keep both displays free of notches or Dynamic Island cutouts.Under-display camera technology has historically produced lower image quality, but a rumored 24MP sensor would be a significant step up compared to existing foldables, which typically use much lower-resolution sensors.iPhone Fold’s hinge and materialsThe hinge is another area where Apple may diverge from competitors. Multiple reports claim Apple will use Liquidmetal, which is a long-standing trade name for a metallic glass alloy the company has previously used in smaller components. While often referred to as “liquid metal” or “Liquid Metal” in reports, Liquidmetal is the branding Apple has historically associated with the material.Liquidmetal is said to be stronger and more resistant to deformation than titanium, while remaining relatively lightweight. If accurate, this could help improve long-term durability and reduce wear on the foldable display.Leaks from Jon Prosser also reference a metal plate beneath the display that works in tandem with the hinge to minimize creasing — a claim that aligns with reporting from Korean and Chinese supply-chain sources.Battery and other components Battery life is another potential differentiator. According to Ming-Chi Kuo and multiple Asian supply-chain reports, Apple is testing high-density battery cells in the 5,000 to 5,800mAh range.That would make it the largest battery ever used in an iPhone, and competitive with (or larger than) batteries in current Android foldables. The device is also expected to use a future A-series chip and Apple’s in-house modem.PriceNone of this will come cheap, that’s for certain. Nearly every report agrees that the iPhone Fold will be Apple’s most expensive iPhone ever.Estimates currently place the price between $2,000 and $2,500 in the US. Bloomberg has said the price will be “at least $2,000,” while other analysts have narrowed the likely range to around $2,100 and $2,300. That positions the iPhone Fold well above the iPhone Pro Max and closer to Apple’s high-end Macs and iPads.Despite years of rumors, there’s still plenty that remains unclear. Apple hasn’t confirmed the name “iPhone Fold,” final dimensions, software features or how iOS would adapt to a folding form factor. Durability, repairability and long-term reliability are also open questions. For now, the safest assumption is that Apple is taking its time and that many of these details could still change before launch.

The latest iPad mini with the A17 Pro chip is down to one of the best prices we've seen right now — $400, which is $100 off. Apple released this iPad mini in late 2024 and it was a solid update. We gave it an 83 in our review thanks to the power of its A17 Pro chip and that it comes with a minimum of 128GB of storage. The model currently on sale comes with 128GB, Wi-Fi and all four color options: Blue, Purple, Space Gray and Starlight. We named the Apple iPad mini our favorite compact iPad — though, to be fair, its only competitor is itself. Still, it's a good iPad with an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, Apple Intelligence and 12MP Wide back and 12MP Ultra Wide cameras. For 20 percent off, it's a great option for a light, useful way to entertain yourself through the rest of winter and beyond.

If you’ve been thinking about upgrading your current TV, now’s a decent time to do it. The weeks leading up to the Super Bowl are typically awash with TV deals to consider. Generally, TV prices steadily decrease after a new model comes out. Some 2026 TV models were announced at CES and are forthcoming things year, making now a good time to look for discounts on 2025 sets. Aside from the holiday shopping season, now is one of the best times of the year to save on a TV. Here, we’ve curated the best Super Bowl TV deals we could find this year, from already affordable sets discounted even further to high-end OLEDs that are hundreds of dollars off. Super Bowl 2026 TV deals for less than $500 You can easily find solid 1080p and 4K TV sets within this budget-friendly price range. What you’ll be more limited in is size — most TV deals under $500 we’re seeing right now are on sets up to 55 inches. There are a few 65- and 75-inch models in there, but the pickings are slim.

          "content": "On Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Chief Marketing Officer Kate Rouch complained on X after rival AI lab Anthropic released four commercials, two of which will run during the Super Bowl on Sunday, mocking the idea of including ads in AI chatbot conversations. Anthropic's campaign seemingly touched a nerve at OpenAI just weeks after the ChatGPT maker began testing ads in a lower-cost tier of its chatbot. Altman called Anthropic's ads \"clearly dishonest,\" accused the company of being \"authoritarian,\" and said it \"serves an expensive product to rich people,\" while Rouch wrote, \"Real betrayal isn't ads. It's control.\" Anthropic's four commercials, part of a campaign called \"A Time and a Place,\" each open with a single word splashed across the screen: \"Betrayal,\" \"Violation,\" \"Deception,\" and \"Treachery.\" They depict scenarios where a person asks a human stand-in for an AI chatbot for personal advice, only to get blindsided by a product pitch.Read full article Comments",

Instead of a place primarily inhabited by humans, the web may very soon be dominated by autonomous AI bots. A new report measuring bot activity on the web, as well as related data shared with WIRED by the Internet infrastructure company Akamai, shows that AI bots already account for a meaningful share of web traffic. The findings also shed light on an increasingly sophisticated arms race unfolding as bots deploy clever tactics to bypass website defenses meant to keep them out. “The majority of the Internet is going to be bot traffic in the future,” says Toshit Pangrahi, cofounder and CEO of TollBit, a company that tracks web-scraping activity and published the new report. “It’s not just a copyright problem, there is a new visitor emerging on the Internet.”Read full article Comments",

During the hearing, which was held by the US Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, Sarandos sought to convince the senators that Netflix wouldn’t hold a streaming monopoly if regulators allow the acquisition to close. Netflix is the largest subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) provider by subscribers (301.63 million as of January 2025), and WBD is the third (128 million streaming subscribers, including users of HBO Max and, to a lesser degree, Discovery+).Read full article Comments",

At present, the only Android phones that can initiate an AirDrop session with Apple devices are Google's latest Pixel 10 devices. When Google announced this upgrade, it vaguely suggested that more developments would come, and it now looks like we'll see more AirDrop support soon. According to Android Authority, Google is planning a big AirDrop expansion in 2026.

          "content": "One of the weirdest corners of the Internet is suddenly hard to find on Bing, after the search engine inexplicably started blocking approximately 1.5 million independent websites hosted on Neocities. Founded in 2013 to archive the \"aesthetic awesomeness\" of GeoCities websites, Neocities keeps the spirit of the 1990s Internet alive. It lets users design free websites without relying on standardized templates devoid of personality. For hundreds of thousands of people building websites around art, niche fandoms, and special expertise—or simply seeking a place to get a little weird online—Neocities provides a blank canvas that can be endlessly personalized when compared to a Facebook page. Delighted visitors discovering these sites are more likely to navigate by hovering flashing pointers over a web of spinning GIFs than clicking a hamburger menu or infinitely scrolling. That's the style of Internet that Kyle Drake, Neocities' founder, strives to maintain. So he was surprised when he noticed that Bing was curiously blocking Neocities sites last summer. At first the issue seemed to be resolved by contacting Microsoft, but after receiving more recent reports that users were struggling to log in, Drake discovered that another complete block was implemented in January. Even more concerning, he saw that after delisting the front page, Bing had started pointing users to a copycat site where he was alarmed to learn they were providing their log-in credentials.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Little kids hosting make-believe tea parties is a fixture of childhood playtime and long presumed to be exclusively a human ability. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University presented evidence in a new paper published in the journal Science that a bonobo named Kanzi was also able to participate in pretending to hold a tea party. For the authors, this suggests that apes are capable of using their imagination just like human toddlers. “It really is game-changing that their mental lives go beyond the here and now,\" said co-author Christopher Krupenye. \"Imagination has long been seen as a critical element of what it is to be human, but the idea that it may not be exclusive to our species is really transformative. Jane Goodall discovered that chimps make tools, and that led to a change in the definition of what it means to be human, and this, too, really invites us to reconsider what makes us special and what mental life is out there among other creatures.\" Per Krupenye et al., by the age of two, human children are able to navigate imaginary scenarios like a tea party, pretending there is real tea present even if the teapot and cups are actually empty. Cognitively speaking, it's an example of secondary representation, because it involves decoupling an imagined or simulated state (pretending there is actual tea in the cup) with the reality (the cup is empty).Read full article Comments",

But for some, bad sleep brings on eyelids so droopy and floppy that they can do curl ups on their own. That was the unfortunate case for a 39-year-old woman who sought care at an ophthalmology clinic in Brooklyn, New York. She told the doctors that for six weeks she felt like she had something in her eyes, and they were watery. By the time of her appointment, her eyelids had rolled up, flipping inside-out on their own—and were staying that way. In the latest issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, doctors report her eye-opening case—and its unexpected solution. (You can see images of her eyelids—flipped and recovered—here. The images may seem graphic to some, but they are not much worse than that kid in elementary school who would flip their eyelids just to freak everyone out for laughs. You know the one.)Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Back in 2022, astronomers were puzzled by a so-called “tidal disruption event” (TDE), dubbed AT2018hyz, that had faded when it was first noticed three years earlier, only to unexpectedly reanimate and burp out extremely bright radio waves. University of Oregon astrophysicist Yvette Cendes, a co-author of that 2022 paper, dubbed the black hole “Jetty McJetface” (a nod to the 2016 online British competition to name a research vessel Boaty McBoatface). Astronomers have continued to monitor it ever since. Far from fading again, the TDE has grown 50 times brighter, and that brightness continues to increase. The black hole's energy emission might not peak until 2027, according to a new paper published in the Astrophysical Journal. As we've previously discussed, it’s a popular misconception that black holes behave like cosmic vacuum cleaners, ravenously sucking up any matter in their surroundings. In reality, only stuff that passes beyond the event horizon—including light—is swallowed up and can’t escape, although black holes are also messy eaters. That means that part of an object’s matter is actually ejected out in a powerful jet.Read full article Comments",

But they should take heart that our region is an outlier. The other side of the Atlantic still seems relatively positive about the whole idea, even as Europe's car market recovers more slowly from the pandemic than the rest of the world. Last year, overall vehicle sales in Europe barely ticked up, rising 2.2 percent from 2024. EV sales, meanwhile, increased by 29 percent, bringing market share to an impressive 19.5 percent. That's according to data from automotive analyst JATO Dynamics, which finds that the big winner has been Volkswagen. Last year, its EVs outsold those from Tesla for the first time as sales of VW's electric offering grew by 56 percent, while Tesla's shrank by 27 percent. To put that into concrete numbers, VW sold 274,278 EVs to Tesla's 236,357. And that's just the VW brand itself—the automaker also owns Skoda (in 4th place, with 171,703 sales), Audi (5th place, 153,845 sales), Cupra (15th place, 79,269 sales), and Porsche (21st place, 32,715 sales).

Valve says it still plans to launch both devices (as well as the new Steam Controller) \"in the first half of the year,\" but that uncertainty around RAM and storage prices mean that Valve \"[has] work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates we can confidently announce, being mindful of how quickly the circumstances around both of these things can change.\"Read full article Comments",

The authors also partnered with a perfumer to re-create what co-author Barbara Huber (of the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology and the University of Tübingen) dubbed “the scent of eternity.” Now Huber has collaborated with the curators of two museums to incorporate that eternal scent into exhibits on ancient Egypt to transform how visitors understand embalming. As previously reported, Egyptian embalming is thought to have begun in the Predynastic Period or earlier, when people noticed that the arid desert heat tended to dry and preserve bodies buried in the desert. Eventually, the idea of preserving the body after death worked its way into Egyptian religious beliefs. When people began burying the dead in rock tombs, away from the desiccating sand, they used chemicals like natron salt and plant-based resins for embalming. The procedure typically began by laying the corpse on a table and removing the internal organs—except for the heart. Per Greek historian Herodotus, “They first draw out part of the brain through the nostrils with an iron hook, and inject certain drugs into the rest” to liquefy the remaining brain matter. Next, they washed out the body cavity with spices and palm wine, sewed the body back up, and left aromatic plants and spices inside, including bags of natron. The body was then allowed to dehydrate over 40 days. The dried organs were sealed in canopic jars (or sometimes put back into the body cavity). Then the body was wrapped in several layers of linen cloth, with amulets placed within those layers to protect the deceased from evil. The fully wrapped mummy was coated in resin to keep moisture out and placed in a coffin (also sealed with resin).Read full article Comments",

          "content": "On Wednesday, Anthropic announced that its AI chatbot, Claude, will remain free of advertisements, drawing a sharp line between itself and rival OpenAI, which began testing ads in a low-cost tier of ChatGPT last month. The announcement comes alongside a Super Bowl ad campaign that mocks AI assistants that interrupt personal conversations with product pitches. \"There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them,\" Anthropic wrote in a blog post. The company argued that including ads in AI conversations would be \"incompatible\" with what it wants Claude to be: \"a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.\" The stance contrasts with OpenAI's January announcement that it would begin testing banner ads for free users and ChatGPT Go subscribers in the US. OpenAI said those ads would appear at the bottom of responses and would not influence the chatbot's actual answers. Paid subscribers on Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will not see ads on ChatGPT.Read full article Comments",

The legislation must still be approved by the full House before being sent to the Senate, which may take up consideration later this month. Congress passes such reauthorization bills every couple of years, providing the space agency with a general sense of the direction legislators want to see NASA go. They are distinct from appropriations bills, which provide actual funding for specific programs, but nonetheless play an important role in establishing space policy. There weren't any huge surprises in the legislation, but there were some interesting amendments. Most notably among these was the Amendment No. 01, offered by the chair of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas), as well as its ranking member, Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), and three other legislators.Read full article Comments",

Filed by the SEC in the final days of Joe Biden's administration, the lawsuit seeks $150 million in disgorgement, plus interest, as well as civil penalties and an injunction blocking Musk from future wrongdoing. The complaint alleged that Musk quietly acquired a 9 percent stake in Twitter without filing necessary timely disclosures to alert other investors of a potential change in company control. This allowed Musk to acquire over 70 million shares at an artificially lower price, the SEC alleged, causing substantial economic harm to investors selling Twitter common stock, some of whom have separately sued.Read full article Comments",

The report concluded that the Trump administration is \"failing American patients,\" and \"destroying medical research through cuts to research grants, terminations of clinical trials, and the chaos it has created.\" Since Trump took office, the NIH has terminated or frozen hundreds of millions of dollars for research grants, including $561 million in grants to research the four leading causes of death in America, the report found.Read full article Comments",
