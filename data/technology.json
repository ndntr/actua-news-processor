          "content": "If you’ve been eyeing Sony’s most advanced noise-canceling headphones, you can already save $61. You can find deals on many of our favorite tech devices and gadgets year-round. But Black Friday is typically when we see the biggest discounts on OLED TVs, great productivity laptops, and robovacs that can help you clean up for the holidays — and this year is no exception. Although we’ve seen a wave of price hikes due to US-sanctioned tariffs, we’re also seeing all-time lows on devices like the base AirPods 4, the PlayStation Portal, and the second-gen Sonos Beam. Our experts have spent weeks vetting supposed discounts and found the deals that are actually worth shopping. If you love saving as much as you do unboxing new tech, well, this is the roundup for you. Below, you’ll find discounts that plunge prices to new depths, stretching your dollar a little bit further this holiday season. AirPods 4 Apple’s AirPods 4 are the latest update to the company’s base-model wireless earbuds. The hard, plastic buds feature improved audio over the third-gen model, along with deep iOS integration and spatial audio with head tracking.

Where to Buy: $119.99 $87.99 at Amazon $119.99 $87.99 at Best Buy $119.99 $87.99 at Anker Astro Bot Astro Bot is the kind of game you buy a PlayStation 5 for. The refreshing title features gorgeous environments and wildly inventive mechanics, many of which turn tried-and-true platforming mechanics on their head. It doesn’t hurt that Sony’s titular robot is absolutely adorable, either. Where to Buy: $59.99 $39.97 at Walmart $59.99 $39.99 at Best Buy $59.99 $40 at GameStop Nomad Tracking Card Air Nomad’s slim Tracking Card Air pairs with Apple’s Find My network, offers up to five months of battery life, and charges wirelessly using any Qi or MagSafe-compatible charger.

It also includes a six-month subscription to Amazon Kids Plus, which offers access to ad-free books, interactive games, and more. Where to Buy: $99.99 $44.99 at Amazon $99.99 $44.99 at Best Buy $99.99 $44.99 at Target Dreame X40 Ultra With a neat ability to remove and reattach its mop pads, the Dreame X40 solves the problem of vacuuming carpets (with 12,000Pa suction power) while also mopping hard floors. Its mops can also swing out and under low furniture, getting where most bots can’t reach. Where to Buy: $1199.99 $499.99 at Amazon $1199.99 $499.99 at Dreame $1199.99 $499.99 at Best Buy Sonos Beam (second-gen) The Sonos Beam (second-gen) is a compact soundbar that supports Dolby Atmos and can stream music from a plethora of services.

However, while it’s great for playing old school N64 games, the lack of a second joystick limits its compatibility with modern titles. Where to Buy: $39.99 $26.12 at Amazon (black) $39.99 $38.63 at Amazon (white) Oura Ring 4 The Oura Ring 4 is slimmer and more accurate than its predecessor, while adding new AI-powered tools and longer battery life.

It retains the original plot and performances, along with various cutscenes, levels, and other gameplay elements.

It’s powerful enough to fill a 26.3-inch medium-sized car tire in under a minute, and its LCD screen displays the tire’s current pressure in realtime. Where to Buy: $109.99 $69.99 at Amazon (with Prime) Apple AirTag Apple’s AirTags can help you find your lost items with their UWB technology. You’ll get the best compatibility with an iPhone, though Apple released an Android app to detect an AirTag’s location if one seems to be following you. Where to Buy: $29 $17.97 at Amazon $29 $17.97 at Walmart $99 $62.99 at Amazon (four-pack) Apple Watch SE 3 The Apple Watch SE 3 offers some big upgrades over its predecessor, including an always-on display, allowing you to glance at the time or unread notifications.

It features TMR joysticks with trigger switches for adjusting the feel, as well as vibration and motion-control support.

They include ANC, more than decent sound quality, and other features like multipoint for a great price. Where to Buy: $99 $59 at Amazon $99 $59 at Nothing Apple Watch Series 11 (42mm, GPS) Although the Apple Watch Series 11 is the same size as its predecessor, it features a 5G cellular modem, a display that’s twice as durable, and slightly improved battery life. Where to Buy: $399 $339 at Amazon $399 $339 at Walmart $399 $339 at Best Buy iPad (2025) Apple’s entry-level iPad is an excellent tablet for casual use.

The basic fitness band can provide you with a Sleep Score every morning, along with tips for improving your sleep. You can also remove the Inspire 3 from its band and wear it as a necklace, which is less obtrusive but disables heart rate tracking.

But in the fall, as the evenings lengthen and the air turns chill, we pause to remember a much more somber occasion: Black Friday, the day Optimus Prime was cruelly cut down by the treacherous hand of his arch-nemesis Megatron while bravely defending Autobot City from attack. Though Optimus Prime did not survive the brutal fight, the Autobot leader’s indomitable spirit nonetheless carried the day and by his decisive actions the Decepticons were routed, fleeing from the city like the cowardly robots they truly are and giving over victory to the forces of light. Although Optimus Prime’s death was tragic and unexpected, things are often darkest just before dawn—and so, even though today is called “Black Friday” to remind us of the day’s solemnity, we choose to honor him the way we honor other important historical figures who also laid their lives upon the altar of freedom: we take the day off to go shopping! Below you’ll find a curated list of the best Black Friday deals that we’ve been able to find. Stand strong in the shadow cast by that long-gone noble Autobot, for by his sacrifice the day was won. Now, as Optimus would say, transform, my friends—transform and buy things.Read full article Comments",

However, on the ground, there was a serious problem during the launch with the ground systems that support processing of the vehicle before liftoff at Site 31, located at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. In a terse statement issued Thursday night on the social media site Telegram, the Russian space corporation that operates Soyuz appeared to downplay the incident: “The launch pad was inspected, as is done every time a rocket is launched. Damage to several launch pad components was identified. Damage can occur after launch, so such inspections are mandatory worldwide.

After humans hunted wolves to near-extinction across the Western US in the early 20th century, the carnivore’s absence likely altered ecosystems and food webs across the Rocky Mountains. Once wolves were reintroduced to the landscape, scientists hoped to learn if, and how quickly, these changes could be reversed. Despite studies claiming to show early evidence of a tantalizing relationship between wolves and regenerating riparian ecosystems since the canines returned to Yellowstone, scientists are still debating how large carnivores impact vegetation and other animals, according to a new paper published this month.Read full article Comments",

They have a standard-size spindle hole and play at 33⅓ RPM, and they hold up to four minutes of music per side. Several smaller bands, like The Band Loula and Rainbow Kitten Surprise, and some industry veterans like Blake Shelton and Melissa Etheridge, have already experimented with the format. But Tiny Vinyl partnered with US retail giant Target for its big coming-out party this fall, with 44 exclusive titles launching throughout the end of this year. Tiny Vinyl supplied a few promotional copies of releases from former America’s Got Talent finalist Grace VanderWaal, The Band Loula, country pop stars Florida Georgia Line, and jazz legends the Vince Guaraldi Trio so I could get a first-hand look at how the records actually play. I tested these titles as well as several others I picked up at retail, playing them on an Audio Technica LP-120 direct drive manual turntable connected to a Yamaha S-301 integrated amplifier and playing through a pair of vintage Klipsch kg4 speakers.Read full article Comments",
