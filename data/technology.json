          "standfirst": "Vinyl records are firmly back in rotation, but getting started does not have to mean spending a fortune or building a complicated hi-fi stack from day one. Whether you want a simple, all-in-one setup with built-in speakers or you are piecing together a more traditional system with a separate amplifier, the best record player is the one that fits how you listen at home. For this guide, we focused on high-quality turntables under $600 that deliver a satisfying listening experience without unnecessary complexity. These picks cover everything from beginner-friendly automatic models to more audiophile-leaning decks that prioritize sound quality and upgrade potential, proving you do not need to jump into the high-end to enjoy vinyl properly. Best record players for 2026 Other record players we tested Audio-Technica AT-LP60XBT This is about as basic as it gets, unless you opt for the AT-LP60X which ditches the Bluetooth connectivity. This is a perfectly decent option for someone just getting into vinyl, but if you spend a little more for the AT-LP70X, you won’t be in quite as big of a hurry to upgrade once you surrender to the obsession. Cambridge Audio Alva ST The Alva ST has a refined design that made me want to keep it out in my living room longer than many of the models on this list. The controls are limited on the top to power and individual options for 33 and 45 RPM speeds. Everything else is on the back panel, including Bluetooth pairing and preamp buttons. To complete the look, Cambridge Audio opted for a 1mm aluminium top plate, which sits on an MDF plinth with a layer of EVA to absorb vibrations in between. While the overall audio performance on the Alva ST is warm and inviting, there is a lack of detail across genres. I’ve noticed albums don’t have a particularly wide soundstage, and songs lack their normal punch at times, so some sound compressed compared to when they’re played on other turntables. Additionally, the free swinging tone arm needs more resistance so it’s not so prone to dropping on a record immediately if it slips out of your fingers when you have the cueing lever down. Since this turntable is fully manual operation, I felt a bit of peril every time I went to lower the needle. (The price increased during testing for this guide.) Denon DP-300F Denon’s DP-300F is a mixed bag. On one hand, you get the convenience of fully automatic operation, dedicated speed and record size buttons and somewhat refined design. There are also some confounding decisions though, like the permanently affixed cables, the preamp switch being under the platter and the overall midrange build quality for a $500 turntable. The sound from the preamp and Denon’s cartridge has a clear lack of depth and detail that almost any model at this price should offer. How to shop for a turntable The first question you’ll need to ask yourself when looking for a turntable is how you plan to use it. Are you into vinyl for the ritual? If you simply like the concept of physical media, having to flip a record to finish it or the need to intentionally swap out an album when it’s done, that’s just fine. You probably can make do with a more affordable turntable since overall sound quality may not be a main concern. If you crave the warmth of analog sound, and you want the collection you’ve invested in to sound its best, you’ll need to consider something with better specs. You’ll also need to account for where and how you’re going to listen to vinyl. Are you planning to connect this turntable to headphones or Bluetooth speakers? Do you have shelf or tower speakers you’re going to use? Are you willing to invest in a dedicated preamp or would you rather a new turntable come with one built in? All of these questions will impact your buying decision — even the Bluetooth codecs, if you’re going the wireless route. Best record players Billy Steele for Engadget Automatic, semi-auto and manual operation If you’re just getting into vinyl, an automatic turntable will save you a lot of stress. These are the models that place the stylus for you — all you have to do is push a button. When you get to the end of the record, the turntable will also return the tonearm to its resting spot automatically. Or, if you need to stop your session mid-side, there’s a button for that too. Some turntables have semi-automatic operation. Maybe they can’t place the needle for you, but they do have an automatic stop when a side of a record is complete. This auto stop, which sometimes comes with an on/off switch, can prevent unnecessary wear on your stylus and vinyl. Plus, many turntables with automatic operation allow you to take control if you need to drop the stylus in a certain place (that’s not the beginning of the record) or if you have a die-cut vinyl (like the It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown soundtrack). Then there’s the fully manual option. Here, you’re solely responsible for placing the tonearm and taking it off when the music stops. A lot of turntables have a cue lever to assist with the process, and a lot of tonearms have a mechanism that lowers them slowly rather than violently dropping them on a record. This adds one more step to the ritual, and it’s one many purists prefer. Preamp The biggest decision you’ll need to make in terms of a preamp is to decide if you want one built into your turntable or if you’d rather use a separate one. It can be very convenient, especially for beginners, to use a built-in component to amplify the signal from the turntable before it hits any speakers or headphones. The downside is that you’re left with what the company provides from the factory, so if you’re looking to upgrade, you’ll have to disable the preamp inside. On most turntables, there’s a switch that allows you to do this, so it’s no trouble. But, opting to skip the preamp on some models could save you money that could be invested elsewhere. A dedicated preamp typically uses higher-quality components and reduces noise by keeping internal parts properly separated. More robust models may even provide controls for things like tone or multiple inputs, while the basic options will simply allow you to plug in, play and forget it. If you’re after the best possible clarity and realism from your record collection, we’d recommend a dedicated preamp right from the start. Best record players Billy Steele for Engadget Removable cartridge/headshell The next item you’ll want to consider is if the turntable you’re eyeing can be upgraded in the future. The best way to do this is by swapping out the cartridge. Most turntables allow you to do this but there are some that don’t, so you’ll need to pay attention to this detail. Upgrading the cartridge down the road is a great way to improve overall sound quality without having to buy a new turntable, new speakers or a new amp. Belt drive vs. direct drive There are two main types of turntables: belt drive and direct drive. All of the models we tested for this guide are belt drive, which means there’s a thin belt that connects the platter to the motor to make the thing spin. Direct drive turntables are widely used by DJs and Technics was the first to make them. Here, the motor is directly under the platter and connected to it directly so the setup is less prone to wearing out. This is especially key when you’re doing things like scratching. Direct-drive turntables tend to be more expensive than their belt-driven counterparts. Counterweight and anti-skate control Most turntables will include a counterweight on the tonearm and some form of anti-skate control. Both of these help keep the stylus in place with the correct amount of pressure, all to ensure proper operation with minimal wear on your records. Sometimes the anti-skate elements are built into the tonearm while other models offer a dedicated dial on the surface of the plinth. The ability to adjust both of these can help you fine-tune the performance of your turntable over time, which may be necessary after upgrading the cartridge or other components. Other components to consider Some final items you’ll want to evaluate on a prospective turntable purchase include the materials used for the base (plinth), platter and even the feet. Cheaper turntables may be mostly plastic affairs while more expensive models can use solid MDF (medium-density fibreboard) for the plinth. A lot of turntables have aluminum platters with a felt pad while others may feature a thick acrylic version. And while entry-level turntables may have small, plastic feet, premium models come with larger, adjustable, rubberized feet for better vibration isolation. While some of these come down to personal preference — a frosted acrylic platter looks really nice — there are some performance boosts to be gained depending on how the company uses the components. How we test turntables Since most turntables under $600 meet the criteria for entry-level through midrange, we tested every model with a set of Audio-Technica AT-SP3X powered speakers. These offer balanced sound for turntables with a 1.1-inch tweeter and 3-inch woofer in each unit. And at $269, they won’t break the bank if you need speakers for your new turntable and they’ll provide ample sound performance even if you spend more than our budget on a new deck. For all of our test units that didn’t have a built-in preamp, we used the Fluance PA-10. At $100, it’s an affordable upgrade if you’re looking to bypass a turntable’s included components or if you’re looking to go more analog with your turntable purchase. There are no buttons or controls, just connect your turntable, speakers and ground wire (if you’re using one) and you’re ready to go. It’s simple, straightforward and inexpensive, so it’s a great option for beginners and more experienced vinyl collectors alike. In terms of performance testing, we play a variety of genres on each turntable to evaluate sound quality. We also carefully examine the overall experience of putting a record on, setting the speed, placing the tonearm and more, which allows us to judge how well each turntable will work for users at different experience levels. Lastly, we take notes on design and components, comparing those elements from each turntable with our other test subjects to make our recommendations.

          "standfirst": "As a former Mint user, I had to find a new budgeting app not too long ago. Intuit, parent company of Mint, shut down the service in March 2024, and prompted users to transition to its other financial app, Credit Karma. However, after testing Credit Karma myself, I found it to be a poor Mint replacement — that meant I needed to branch out and look elsewhere for a trusted app to track all of my financial accounts, monitor my credit score, follow a monthly spending plan and set goals like building a rainy-day fund and paying down my mortgage faster.I tried out Mint's top competitors in the hopes that I'd be able to find a new budgeting app that could handle all of my financial needs. Hopefully my journey can help you find the best budgeting app for you and your money as well. Best budget apps of 2026 Other budgeting apps we tested PocketGuard PocketGuard used to be a solid free budget tracker, but the company has since limited its “free” version to just a free seven-day trial. Now, you’ll have to choose between two plans once the trial is over: a $13 monthly plan or a $75 annual plan. When I first tested it, I found it to be more restricted than NerdWallet, but still a decent option. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals. Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and that’s what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income. Although PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate. Ultimately, now that the free tier is gone, it just doesn’t present the same value proposition as it once did. How we test budgeting apps Before I dove in and started testing out budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to try out, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps (or other budgeting methods) they might be using for money management. Some of the apps I found were free and these, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.) All of the services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web. Once I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps, I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable Groundhog Day of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once. Budgeting app FAQs What is Plaid and how does it work? Each of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, the company claims. To be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including all of the budgeting apps listed in this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well. As the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices. In a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.” Why did Mint shut down? When parent company Intuit announced in December 2023 that it would shut down Mint, it did not provide a reason why it made the decision to do so. It did say that Mint's millions of users would be funneled over to its other finance app, Credit Karma. \"Credit Karma is thrilled to invite all Minters to continue their financial journey on Credit Karma, where they will have access to Credit Karma’s suite of features, products, tools and services, including some of Mint’s most popular features,\" Mint wrote on its product blog. In our testing, we found that Credit Karma isn't an exact replacement for Mint — so if you're still looking for a Mint alternative, you have some decent options. What about Rocket Money? Rocket Money is another free financial app that tracks spending and supports things like balance alerts and account linking. If you pay for the premium tier, the service can also help you cancel unwanted subscriptions. We did not test it for this guide, but we'll consider it in future updates.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html?src=rss",

Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well. As the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices. In a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.” Why did Mint shut down? When parent company Intuit announced in December 2023 that it would shut down Mint, it did not provide a reason why it made the decision to do so. It did say that Mint's millions of users would be funneled over to its other finance app, Credit Karma. \"Credit Karma is thrilled to invite all Minters to continue their financial journey on Credit Karma, where they will have access to Credit Karma’s suite of features, products, tools and services, including some of Mint’s most popular features,\" Mint wrote on its product blog. In our testing, we found that Credit Karma isn't an exact replacement for Mint — so if you're still looking for a Mint alternative, you have some decent options. What about Rocket Money? Rocket Money is another free financial app that tracks spending and supports things like balance alerts and account linking. If you pay for the premium tier, the service can also help you cancel unwanted subscriptions. We did not test it for this guide, but we'll consider it in future updates.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Chinese AI startup Zhupai aka z.ai is back this week with an eye-popping new frontier large language model: GLM-5.The latest in z.ai&#x27;s ongoing and continually impressive GLM series, it retains an open source MIT License — perfect for enterprise deployment – and, in one of several notable achievements, achieves a record-low hallucination rate on the independent Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index v4.0. With a score of -1 on the AA-Omniscience Index—representing a massive 35-point improvement over its predecessor—GLM-5 now leads the entire AI industry, including U.S. competitors like Google, OpenAI and Anthropic, in knowledge reliability by knowing when to abstain rather than fabricate information.Beyond its reasoning prowess, GLM-5 is built for high-utility knowledge work. It features native \"Agent Mode\" capabilities that allow it to turn raw prompts or source materials directly into professional office documents, including ready-to-use .docx, .pdf, and .xlsx files. Whether generating detailed financial reports, high school sponsorship proposals, or complex spreadsheets, GLM-5 delivers results in real-world formats that integrate directly into enterprise workflows.It is also disruptively priced at roughly $0.80 per million input tokens and $2.56 per million output tokens, approximately 6x cheaper than proprietary competitors like Claude Opus 4.6, making state-of-the-art agentic engineering more cost-effective than ever before. Here&#x27;s what else enterprise decision makers should know about the model and its training. Technology: scaling for agentic efficiencyAt the heart of GLM-5 is a massive leap in raw parameters. The model scales from the 355B parameters of GLM-4.5 to a staggering 744B parameters, with 40B active per token in its Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This growth is supported by an increase in pre-training data to 28.5T tokens.To address training inefficiencies at this magnitude, Zai developed \"slime,\" a novel asynchronous reinforcement learning (RL) infrastructure. Traditional RL often suffers from \"long-tail\" bottlenecks; Slime breaks this lockstep by allowing trajectories to be generated independently, enabling the fine-grained iterations necessary for complex agentic behavior. By integrating system-level optimizations like Active Partial Rollouts (APRIL), slime addresses the generation bottlenecks that typically consume over 90% of RL training time, significantly accelerating the iteration cycle for complex agentic tasks.The framework’s design is centered on a tripartite modular system: a high-performance training module powered by Megatron-LM, a rollout module utilizing SGLang and custom routers for high-throughput data generation, and a centralized Data Buffer that manages prompt initialization and rollout storage. By enabling adaptive verifiable environments and multi-turn compilation feedback loops, slime provides the robust, high-throughput foundation required to transition AI from simple chat interactions toward rigorous, long-horizon systems engineering.To keep deployment manageable, GLM-5 integrates DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), preserving a 200K context capacity while drastically reducing costs.End-to-end knowledge workZai is framing GLM-5 as an \"office\" tool for the AGI era. While previous models focused on snippets, GLM-5 is built to deliver ready-to-use documents. It can autonomously transform prompts into formatted .docx, .pdf, and .xlsx files—ranging from financial reports to sponsorship proposals. In practice, this means the model can decompose high-level goals into actionable subtasks and perform \"Agentic Engineering,\" where humans define quality gates while the AI handles execution.High performance GLM-5’s benchmarks make it the new most powerful open source model in the world, according to Artificial Analysis, surpassing Chinese rival Moonshot&#x27;s new Kimi K2.5 released just two weeks ago, showing that Chinese AI companies are nearly caught up with far better resourced proprietary Western rivals. According to z.ai&#x27;s own materials shared today, GLM-5 ranks near state-of-the-art on several key benchmarks:SWE-bench Verified: GLM-5 achieved a score of 77.8, outperforming Gemini 3 Pro (76.2) and approaching Claude Opus 4.6 (80.9).Vending Bench 2: In a simulation of running a business, GLM-5 ranked #1 among open-source models with a final balance of $4,432.12.Beyond performance, GLM-5 is aggressively undercutting the market. Live on OpenRouter as of February 11, 2026, it is priced at approximately $0.80–$1.00 per million input tokens and $2.56–$3.20 per million output tokens.

          "title": "Anthropic’s Claude Cowork finally lands on Windows — and it wants to automate your workday",
          "standfirst": "Anthropic released its Claude Cowork AI agent software for Windows on Monday, bringing the file management and task automation tool to roughly 70 percent of the desktop computing market and intensifying a remarkable corporate realignment that has seen Microsoft embrace a direct competitor to its longtime AI partner, OpenAI.The Windows launch arrives with what Anthropic calls \"full feature parity\" with the macOS version: file access, multi-step task execution, plugins, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) connectors for integrating external services. Users can now also set global and folder-specific instructions that Claude follows in every session, a feature developers on Reddit described as \"a game-changer\" for maintaining context across projects.\"Cowork is now available on Windows,\" Anthropic announced on X. \"We&#x27;re bringing full feature parity with MacOS: file access, multi-step task execution, plugins, and MCP connectors.\"The release closes a critical platform gap that had limited Cowork to Apple&#x27;s operating system since its January 12 debut. The Windows expansion underscores a broader transformation already underway in enterprise AI, with Microsoft simultaneously selling its own GitHub Copilot to customers while encouraging thousands of its own employees to adopt Anthropic&#x27;s competing tools internally.Inside Microsoft&#x27;s surprising pivot toward its biggest AI rivalThe relationship between Microsoft and Anthropic has accelerated with striking speed. In November, the two companies announced a strategic partnership allowing Microsoft Foundry customers access to Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Claude Haiku 4.5. As part of that arrangement, Anthropic committed to purchasing $30 billion of Azure compute capacity.But the partnership has expanded well beyond cloud hosting. According to a January 22 report in The Verge, Microsoft has begun encouraging thousands of employees from some of its most prolific teams to adopt Claude Code — and now, by extension, Cowork — even if they have no coding experience.Microsoft&#x27;s CoreAI team, the new AI engineering group led by former Meta engineering chief Jay Parikh, has tested Claude Code in recent months, The Verge reported. The company has also approved Claude Code across all code and repositories for its Business and Industry Copilot teams.\"Software engineers at Microsoft are now expected to use both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot and give feedback comparing the two,\" The Verge reported.The company&#x27;s spending on Anthropic approaches $500 million annually, according to The Information. Microsoft has even begun counting Anthropic AI model sales toward Azure sales quotas — an unusual incentive structure that the company typically reserves for homegrown products or models from OpenAI.A $13 billion partnership faces new questions as Microsoft hedges its betsMicrosoft&#x27;s embrace of Anthropic raises uncomfortable questions about its $13 billion investment in OpenAI, which has long served as the exclusive provider of frontier AI models for Microsoft&#x27;s products. The two companies signed their landmark partnership in 2019, with Microsoft providing Azure computing infrastructure in exchange for preferential access to OpenAI&#x27;s technology.That relationship now appears to be evolving into something more nuanced. Microsoft has started favoring Anthropic&#x27;s Claude models inside Microsoft 365 apps and Copilot recently, deploying them in specific applications or features where Anthropic&#x27;s models have proven more capable than OpenAI&#x27;s counterparts.On February 5, Microsoft announced that Claude Opus 4.6 — Anthropic&#x27;s most advanced model — would become available in Microsoft Foundry, the company&#x27;s enterprise AI platform. The Azure blog post framed the integration as bringing \"even more capability to agents that increasingly learn from and act on business systems.\"\"At Microsoft we believe that intelligence and trust are the core requirements of agentic AI at scale,\" the announcement stated. \"Built on Azure, Microsoft Foundry brings these capabilities together on a secure, scalable cloud foundation for enterprise AI.\"The timing and tone suggest Microsoft views Anthropic not merely as a hedging strategy but as a genuine technical leader in certain domains. Claude Opus 4.6 offers a one-million-token context window and 128,000-token maximum output — specifications that position it for complex, long-running enterprise tasks that require processing vast amounts of information.Why a $285 billion stock selloff has the software industry questioning its futureThe deepening Microsoft-Anthropic alliance takes on added significance when viewed against a backdrop of genuine alarm rippling through the software industry. Within days of the macOS launch in January, investors began repricing SaaS companies whose products overlap with Cowork&#x27;s capabilities — project management tools, writing assistants, data analysis platforms, and workflow automation software all saw sharp declines.Bloomberg reported that Cowork triggered a $285 billion software stocks selloff. The carnage reflected growing investor conviction that AI agents capable of automating knowledge work could render entire categories of enterprise software obsolete.The fear is not abstract. Cowork operates as a desktop agent powered by Claude Opus 4.6 that can read local files, execute multi-step tasks, and interact with external services through plugins — all running directly on a user&#x27;s machine. Unlike chatbot interfaces that respond to individual prompts, Cowork plans and executes complete workflows across files, applications, and connected services.Anthropic has leaned into this positioning. On January 30, the company&#x27;s Anthropic Labs division released 11 open-source agentic plugins spanning sales, legal, finance, marketing, data analysis, and software development. These plugins connect Cowork to external tools, enabling the agent to pull data from CRMs, draft legal documents, analyze spreadsheets, or manage project boards without users switching applications.The hidden risks of giving an AI agent access to your filesSuch convenience comes with tradeoffs, and Anthropic has been transparent about the risks inherent in agent software that can read, write, and delete files. The company&#x27;s support documentation warns users to \"be cautious about granting access to sensitive information like financial documents, credentials, or personal records\" and suggests saving backups and creating dedicated folders with nonsensitive information.Cowork remains susceptible to prompt injection attacks — hidden instructions embedded in documents or websites that can hijack AI agents and redirect their actions. The browser automation feature includes an explicit disclaimer warning that hidden code in websites may \"steal your data, inject malware into your systems, or take over your system.\"\"We use a virtual machine under the hood,\" Boris Cherny, Anthropic&#x27;s head of Claude Code, told Wired. \"This means you have to say which folders Claude has access to. And if you don&#x27;t give it access to a folder, Claude literally cannot see that folder.\"The Windows version includes additional safety constraints.

          "content": "Anthropic released its Claude Cowork AI agent software for Windows on Monday, bringing the file management and task automation tool to roughly 70 percent of the desktop computing market and intensifying a remarkable corporate realignment that has seen Microsoft embrace a direct competitor to its longtime AI partner, OpenAI.The Windows launch arrives with what Anthropic calls \"full feature parity\" with the macOS version: file access, multi-step task execution, plugins, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) connectors for integrating external services. Users can now also set global and folder-specific instructions that Claude follows in every session, a feature developers on Reddit described as \"a game-changer\" for maintaining context across projects.\"Cowork is now available on Windows,\" Anthropic announced on X. \"We&#x27;re bringing full feature parity with MacOS: file access, multi-step task execution, plugins, and MCP connectors.\"The release closes a critical platform gap that had limited Cowork to Apple&#x27;s operating system since its January 12 debut. The Windows expansion underscores a broader transformation already underway in enterprise AI, with Microsoft simultaneously selling its own GitHub Copilot to customers while encouraging thousands of its own employees to adopt Anthropic&#x27;s competing tools internally.Inside Microsoft&#x27;s surprising pivot toward its biggest AI rivalThe relationship between Microsoft and Anthropic has accelerated with striking speed. In November, the two companies announced a strategic partnership allowing Microsoft Foundry customers access to Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Claude Haiku 4.5. As part of that arrangement, Anthropic committed to purchasing $30 billion of Azure compute capacity.But the partnership has expanded well beyond cloud hosting. According to a January 22 report in The Verge, Microsoft has begun encouraging thousands of employees from some of its most prolific teams to adopt Claude Code — and now, by extension, Cowork — even if they have no coding experience.Microsoft&#x27;s CoreAI team, the new AI engineering group led by former Meta engineering chief Jay Parikh, has tested Claude Code in recent months, The Verge reported. The company has also approved Claude Code across all code and repositories for its Business and Industry Copilot teams.\"Software engineers at Microsoft are now expected to use both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot and give feedback comparing the two,\" The Verge reported.The company&#x27;s spending on Anthropic approaches $500 million annually, according to The Information. Microsoft has even begun counting Anthropic AI model sales toward Azure sales quotas — an unusual incentive structure that the company typically reserves for homegrown products or models from OpenAI.A $13 billion partnership faces new questions as Microsoft hedges its betsMicrosoft&#x27;s embrace of Anthropic raises uncomfortable questions about its $13 billion investment in OpenAI, which has long served as the exclusive provider of frontier AI models for Microsoft&#x27;s products. The two companies signed their landmark partnership in 2019, with Microsoft providing Azure computing infrastructure in exchange for preferential access to OpenAI&#x27;s technology.That relationship now appears to be evolving into something more nuanced. Microsoft has started favoring Anthropic&#x27;s Claude models inside Microsoft 365 apps and Copilot recently, deploying them in specific applications or features where Anthropic&#x27;s models have proven more capable than OpenAI&#x27;s counterparts.On February 5, Microsoft announced that Claude Opus 4.6 — Anthropic&#x27;s most advanced model — would become available in Microsoft Foundry, the company&#x27;s enterprise AI platform. The Azure blog post framed the integration as bringing \"even more capability to agents that increasingly learn from and act on business systems.\"\"At Microsoft we believe that intelligence and trust are the core requirements of agentic AI at scale,\" the announcement stated. \"Built on Azure, Microsoft Foundry brings these capabilities together on a secure, scalable cloud foundation for enterprise AI.\"The timing and tone suggest Microsoft views Anthropic not merely as a hedging strategy but as a genuine technical leader in certain domains. Claude Opus 4.6 offers a one-million-token context window and 128,000-token maximum output — specifications that position it for complex, long-running enterprise tasks that require processing vast amounts of information.Why a $285 billion stock selloff has the software industry questioning its futureThe deepening Microsoft-Anthropic alliance takes on added significance when viewed against a backdrop of genuine alarm rippling through the software industry. Within days of the macOS launch in January, investors began repricing SaaS companies whose products overlap with Cowork&#x27;s capabilities — project management tools, writing assistants, data analysis platforms, and workflow automation software all saw sharp declines.Bloomberg reported that Cowork triggered a $285 billion software stocks selloff. The carnage reflected growing investor conviction that AI agents capable of automating knowledge work could render entire categories of enterprise software obsolete.The fear is not abstract. Cowork operates as a desktop agent powered by Claude Opus 4.6 that can read local files, execute multi-step tasks, and interact with external services through plugins — all running directly on a user&#x27;s machine. Unlike chatbot interfaces that respond to individual prompts, Cowork plans and executes complete workflows across files, applications, and connected services.Anthropic has leaned into this positioning. On January 30, the company&#x27;s Anthropic Labs division released 11 open-source agentic plugins spanning sales, legal, finance, marketing, data analysis, and software development. These plugins connect Cowork to external tools, enabling the agent to pull data from CRMs, draft legal documents, analyze spreadsheets, or manage project boards without users switching applications.The hidden risks of giving an AI agent access to your filesSuch convenience comes with tradeoffs, and Anthropic has been transparent about the risks inherent in agent software that can read, write, and delete files. The company&#x27;s support documentation warns users to \"be cautious about granting access to sensitive information like financial documents, credentials, or personal records\" and suggests saving backups and creating dedicated folders with nonsensitive information.Cowork remains susceptible to prompt injection attacks — hidden instructions embedded in documents or websites that can hijack AI agents and redirect their actions. The browser automation feature includes an explicit disclaimer warning that hidden code in websites may \"steal your data, inject malware into your systems, or take over your system.\"\"We use a virtual machine under the hood,\" Boris Cherny, Anthropic&#x27;s head of Claude Code, told Wired. \"This means you have to say which folders Claude has access to. And if you don&#x27;t give it access to a folder, Claude literally cannot see that folder.\"The Windows version includes additional safety constraints. According to user reports on Reddit, Cowork on Windows restricts file access to the user&#x27;s personal folder, preventing the agent from accessing common development directories like C:\\git. While some users expressed frustration at this limitation, others noted it as a prudent safeguard for less technical users.\"To be fair, seeing how many people nuked themselves with Claude Code, it is much safer to limit people to reduce the collateral damage,\" wrote one Reddit user.Major corporations are already betting on Claude&#x27;s enterprise potentialDespite the security caveats, early enterprise adoption suggests meaningful interest.

          "standfirst": "When enterprises fine-tune LLMs for new tasks, they risk breaking everything the models already know. This forces companies to maintain separate models for every skill.Researchers at MIT, the Improbable AI Lab and ETH Zurich have developed a new technique that enables large language models to learn new skills and knowledge without forgetting their past capabilities.Their technique, called self-distillation fine-tuning (SDFT), allows models to learn directly from demonstrations and their own experiments by leveraging the inherent in-context learning abilities of modern LLMs. Experiments show that SDFT consistently outperforms traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while addressing the limitations of reinforcement learning algorithms.For enterprise applications, the method enables a single model to accumulate multiple skills over time without suffering from performance regression on earlier tasks. This offers a potential pathway for building AI agents that can adapt to dynamic business environments, gathering new proprietary knowledge and skills as needed without requiring expensive retraining cycles or losing their general reasoning abilities.The challenge of continual learningOnce an LLM is trained and deployed, it remains static. It does not update its parameters to acquire new skills, internalize new knowledge, or improve from experience. To build truly adaptive AI, the industry needs to solve \"continual learning,\" allowing systems to accumulate knowledge much like humans do throughout their careers.The most effective way for models to learn is through \"on-policy learning.” In this approach, the model learns from data it generates itself allowing it to correct its own errors and reasoning processes. This stands in contrast to learning by simply mimicking static datasets. Without on-policy learning, models are prone to \"catastrophic forgetting,\" a phenomenon where learning a new task causes the model to lose its past knowledge and ability to perform previous tasks.However, on-policy learning typically requires reinforcement learning (RL), which depends on an explicit reward function to score the model&#x27;s outputs. This works well for problems with clear outcomes, such as math and coding. But in many real-world enterprise scenarios (e.g., writing a legal brief or summarizing a meeting), defining a mathematical reward function is difficult or impossible.RL methods also often fail when trying to teach a model entirely new information, such as a specific company protocol or a new product line. As Idan Shenfeld, a doctorate student at MIT and co-author of the paper, told VentureBeat, \"No matter how many times the base model tries, it cannot generate correct answers for a topic it has zero knowledge about,\" meaning it never gets a positive signal to learn from.The standard alternative is supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model is trained on a fixed dataset of expert demonstrations. While SFT provides clear ground truth, it is inherently \"off-policy.\" Because the model is just mimicking data rather than learning from its own attempts, it often fails to generalize to out-of-distribution examples and suffers heavily from catastrophic forgetting. SDFT seeks to bridge this gap: enabling the benefits of on-policy learning using only prerecorded demonstrations, without needing a reward function.How SDFT worksSDFT solves this problem by using \"distillation,\" a process where a student model learns to mimic a teacher. The researchers’ insight was to use the model&#x27;s own \"in-context learning\" (ICL) capabilities to create a feedback loop within a single model.In-context learning is the phenomenon where you provide the LLM with a difficult task and one or more demonstrations of how similar problems are solved. Most advanced LLMs are designed to solve new problems with ICL examples, without any parameter updates.During the training cycle, SDFT employs the model in two roles.The teacher: A frozen version of the model is fed the query along with expert demonstrations. Using ICL, the teacher deduces the correct answer and the reasoning logic required to reach it.The student: This version sees only the query, simulating a real-world deployment scenario where no answer key is available.When the student generates an answer, the teacher, which has access to the expert demonstrations, provides feedback. The student then updates its parameters to align closer to the teacher&#x27;s distribution.This process effectively creates an on-policy learning loop by combining elements of SFT and RL. The supervision comes not from a static dataset, but from the model’s own interaction and outputs. It allows the model to correct its own reasoning trajectories without requiring an external reward signal. This process works even for new knowledge that RL would miss.SDFT in actionTo validate the approach, the researchers tested SDFT using the open-weight Qwen 2.5 model on three complex enterprise-grade skills: science Q&A, software tool use, and medical reasoning.The results showed that SDFT learned new tasks more effectively than standard methods. On the Science Q&A benchmark, the SDFT model achieved 70.2% accuracy, compared to 66.2% for the standard SFT approach.More important for enterprise adoption is the impact on catastrophic forgetting. When the standard SFT model learned the science task, its ability to answer general questions (such as logic or humanities) collapsed. In contrast, the SDFT model improved on the science task while holding its \"Previous Tasks\" score steady at 64.5%. This stability suggests companies could specialize models for specific departments (e.g., HR or Legal) without degrading the model’s basic common sense or reasoning capabilities.The team also simulated a knowledge injection scenario, creating a dataset of fictional \"2025 Natural Disasters\" to teach the model new facts. They tested the model on indirect reasoning questions, such as \"Given the floods in 2025, which countries likely needed humanitarian aid?\"Standard SFT resulted in a model that memorized facts but struggled to use them in reasoning scenarios. The SDFT model, having internalized the logic during training, scored 98% on the same questions.Finally, the researchers conducted a sequential learning experiment, training the model on science, tool use, and medical tasks one after another. While the standard model’s performance oscillated, losing previous skills as it learned new ones, the SDFT model successfully accumulated all three skills without regression.This capability addresses a major pain point for enterprises currently managing \"model zoos\" of separate adapters for different tasks.\"We offer the ability to maintain only a single model for all the company&#x27;s needs,\" Shenfeld said. This consolidation \"can lead to a substantial reduction in inference costs\" because organizations don&#x27;t need to host multiple models simultaneously.SDFT limitations and availabilityThe code for SDFT is available on GitHub and ready to be integrated into existing model training workflows.\"The SDFT pipeline is more similar to the RL pipeline in that it requires online response generation during training,\" Shenfeld said. They are working with Hugging Face to integrate SDFT into the latter’s Transformer Reinforcement Learning (TRL) library, he added, noting that a pull request is already open for developers who want to test the integration.For teams considering SDFT, the practical tradeoffs come down to model size and compute. The technique requires models with strong enough in-context learning to act as their own teachers — currently around 4 billion parameters with newer architectures like Qwen 3, though Shenfeld expects 1 billion-parameter models to work soon. It demands roughly 2.5 times the compute of standard fine-tuning, but is best suited for organizations that need a single model to accumulate multiple skills over time, particularly in domains where defining a reward function for reinforcement learning is difficult or impossible.While effective, the method does come with computational tradeoffs. SDFT is approximately four times slower and requires 2.5 times more computational power (FLOPs) than standard fine-tuning because the model must actively generate its own answers (\"rollouts\") during training to compare against the teacher. However, the researchers note that because the model retains knowledge better, organizations may avoid the costly multi-stage retraining processes often required to repair models that suffer from catastrophic forgetting.The technique also relies on the underlying model being large enough to benefit from in-context learning. The paper notes that smaller models (e.g., 3 billion parameters) initially struggled because they lacked the \"intelligence\" to act as their own teachers.However, Shenfeld said that the rapid improvement of small models is changing this dynamic. \"The Qwen 2.5 3B models were too weak, but in some experiments we currently do, we found that the Qwen 3 4B model is strong enough,\" he said. \"I see a future where even 1B models have good enough ICL capabilities to support SDFT.\"Ultimately, the goal is to move beyond static snapshots toward systems that improve through use.\"Lifelong learning, together with the ability to extract learning signal from unstructured user interactions... will bring models that just keep and keep improving with time,” Shenfeld said. “Think about the fact that already the majority of compute around the world goes into inference instead of training. We have to find ways to harness this compute to improve our models.\"",

          "standfirst": "This is going to be one of the shortest articles in my series on how to cancel your subscriptions to the best VPNs. Unlike most providers, Mullvad VPN does not automatically renew an expired subscription unless you tell it to. Thanks to its unique pricing approach, cancelling Mullvad is the default option.When you sign up for Mullvad, you pay for as many months upfront as you want at the constant rate of 5 Euro per month (varying with exchange rates). Each month, Mullvad takes 5 Euro out of your account until there's nothing left. If you're no longer satisfied with Mullvad, all you have to do is stop putting money in.The Mullvad account dashboard.Sam Chapman for EngadgetIf you happen to have originally signed up for Mullvad earlier than the middle of 2022, you may have an auto-renewal account grandfathered in. Mid-2022 is when Mullvad stopped auto-renewing subscriptions and got rid of PayPal integration altogether, but people who had signed up before then had the option to leave auto-renewal on.If you're in this group, cancelling is simple. Just sign into your account page, click on the word Subscriptions, then click Unsubscribe.How to cancel Mullvad if you subscribed through an app storeThere's one more exception to the usual method of cancelling Mullvad. If you got your subscription through an app store instead of Mullvad's website or app, the app store is the one processing your money. You'll need to cancel through them instead.On an iPhone or iPad, open the Settings app, whose icon shows gray gears.

          "content": "This is going to be one of the shortest articles in my series on how to cancel your subscriptions to the best VPNs. Unlike most providers, Mullvad VPN does not automatically renew an expired subscription unless you tell it to. Thanks to its unique pricing approach, cancelling Mullvad is the default option.When you sign up for Mullvad, you pay for as many months upfront as you want at the constant rate of 5 Euro per month (varying with exchange rates). Each month, Mullvad takes 5 Euro out of your account until there's nothing left. If you're no longer satisfied with Mullvad, all you have to do is stop putting money in.The Mullvad account dashboard.Sam Chapman for EngadgetIf you happen to have originally signed up for Mullvad earlier than the middle of 2022, you may have an auto-renewal account grandfathered in. Mid-2022 is when Mullvad stopped auto-renewing subscriptions and got rid of PayPal integration altogether, but people who had signed up before then had the option to leave auto-renewal on.If you're in this group, cancelling is simple. Just sign into your account page, click on the word Subscriptions, then click Unsubscribe.How to cancel Mullvad if you subscribed through an app storeThere's one more exception to the usual method of cancelling Mullvad. If you got your subscription through an app store instead of Mullvad's website or app, the app store is the one processing your money. You'll need to cancel through them instead.On an iPhone or iPad, open the Settings app, whose icon shows gray gears.

          "standfirst": "NordVPN is offering a significant discount on its two-year plans, with 70 percent off its Complete tier and up to 78 percent off overall. For the Complete tier, the deal brings the total cost down to $130 for 24 months. NordVPN regularly appears on Engadget’s list of the best VPN services thanks to its wide server network, strong security tools and consistent performance across devices. NordVPN’s latest promotion puts one of its most comprehensive plans at a price that undercuts many competing premium VPN subscriptions. The Complete tier includes full access to NordVPN’s core VPN service, which encrypts internet traffic and masks a user’s IP address to help protect online activity on public Wi-Fi networks and at home. Subscribers can use the service on multiple devices, including phones, tablets, laptops and smart TVs, with apps available for major operating systems. It also includes access to NordPass (more on that below), an ad blocker and 1TB of cloud storage. You’ll find similar discounts on all of NordVPN’s other plans: Basic, Plus and Prime. Beyond the basics, NordVPN offers features like threat protection to help block malicious websites and trackers, as well as specialty servers designed for added privacy or faster performance in specific scenarios. In our NordVPN review, the service was praised for its evolving feature set and overall reliability, even as the VPN market becomes increasingly competitive. Engadget regularly tracks VPN pricing trends and this offer compares favorably with other current promotions. It also appears alongside NordVPN deals featured in Engadget’s ongoing roundup of the best VPN discounts available right now, which compares offers from multiple major providers. Those looking for additional security tools may also want to note that NordVPN’s Complete plan bundles in extra services beyond the VPN itself. One of those is NordPass, the company’s password management app. NordPass is also discounted as part of a separate promotion, if you’re primarily looking for a password manager rather than a VPN. The Premium tier is currently 50 percent off, bringing the price down to $36 for two years. NordPass Premium adds features such as cross-device password syncing, secure password sharing and breach monitoring, which alerts users if stored credentials appear in known data leaks. Both offers are available for a limited time, though Nord has not specified an end date for the promotion. If you’re still unsure whether NordVPN is right for you, it offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can change your mind and get a full refund.

There are so many fast, intelligently designed, full-featured and affordable services on the market that the biggest problem is picking one. For any use case, you can bet at least two providers will be neck-and-neck for first place. On the other hand, the VPN world is still the Wild West in some ways. It's easy enough to slap a cheap VPN together that the market is flooded with low-quality apps that put more money into advertising than infrastructure. They may look good, but it's all styrofoam under the hood. I built this list of the best VPNs after intensive testing to help you reorient your focus on the providers that actually deserve your time and money. Which one truly fits your needs is dependent on who you are and what you do online, but if you pick any of my seven recommendations, you can't go too far wrong. If you're interested in a service you can use without paying, head over to my list of the best free VPNs — and if you're willing to pay but want to save money, I keep a list of the best VPN deals updated weekly. For each VPN on this list, I've shared which platforms it works on, how much it cuts into your download speed, where it offers servers, what other features are included and how much the best available deal costs. At the end, I'll list some honorable and dishonorable mentions, then answer some of the most common questions I hear about VPNs. Editor's note: This list is up-to-date as of February 2026.

Table of contents Best VPNs for 2026 Other VPNs we tested What to look for in a VPN VPN FAQs Best VPNs for 2026 Other VPNs we tested The VPNs in this section didn't crack our top list above, but we're summarizing them here so you can see their positives and negatives as of the time of our evaluation. Windscribe Windscribe is another well-known free VPN supported by paid subscriptions. In many ways, it takes the best from both Mullvad and Proton VPN, with the former's no-nonsense privacy and the latter's healthy free plan. Without paying, you can connect to 10 of Windscribe's server locations on an unlimited number of devices at once. We've just published a full Windscribe review that can tell you more. Unfortunately, Windscribe didn't copy the most important part of Proton VPN's free plan — the unlimited data. You're only allowed to use 10GB per month, which isn't enough for regular streaming. It's also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways. Private Internet Access Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) has a deeply annoying name — I assume whoever invented it also likes to hop in their Toyota Forward Motion to grab a gallon of Sustaining Cow Extract from the grocery store — but it's a worthwhile VPN whose pricing provides incredible value. Its monthly and yearly plans are good enough, but its three-year plan is the clincher. Not only is it longer than average, but you can continue to renew at the three-year level, so you won't see an unpleasant price jump the first time you re-up. PIA's apps have a dark UI reminiscent of Proton VPN, which is always a good thing. It also supports port forwarding, custom DNS and the use of a SOCKS5 or Shadowsocks proxy as a second step in the VPN connection. You can even set the maximum data packet size to help out a struggling connection, as I cover in my full PIA VPN review. The downside is that your connection will struggle a lot. While well-designed, PIA's apps have a tendency to lag. In my most recent battery of tests, it dragged oddly on my internet in ways that weren't directly reflected in the speed tests. It's also not always capable of unblocking streaming services in other countries, and while its server network offers 152 IP address options in 84 countries, it's heavily bulked out by virtual locations. TunnelBear TunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it's far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month. VyprVPN VyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn't crack the VPN encryption itself). It's also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks. Despite all that, it didn't make the top seven because its connection speeds aren't up to scratch — you'll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits. Norton VPN Norton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It's a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix. This isn't to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won't find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts. What to look for in a VPN Choosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We're here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below. For more advice and dangers to look for, check out my article on how to tell if your VPN is working. Compatibility: First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren't always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need. Speed: Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use Ookla's speedtest.net). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it's actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it's using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content. Background: Do some outside research into the VPN's origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It's a dealbreaker if you can't figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit. Server network: Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you'll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada. Customer Service: I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it's available at convenient times in your timezone. Pricing: Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you're comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals. VPN FAQs To wrap up, let's answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don't cover here. What is a VPN? VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, including corporate VPNs like Cisco AnyConnect, Perimeter81 and NordLayer, which are used to access a single network securely. For this list, though, we're talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity. Whenever you get online, you're assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it's possible to create a record of what an individual does online. When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN's servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won't trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN's IP address, not yours. If you're interested in more detail, I've written a whole article on how a VPN works. What are some things VPNs are used for? The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online. One side effect of borrowing a VPN's IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online. Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as certain US states or countries — like the UK — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn't blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN's homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn't mean that authorities can't detect that it's being used in a given location. Are VPNs worth it? Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It's no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world. With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries. What information does a VPN hide? A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship. However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there's nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you're using a VPN. A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can't do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that's concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up. Are VPNs safe? As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there's very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before. All that said, there are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, and others that pretend to be independent services while all secretly working off the same backend. Always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it. Can you get a VPN on your phone? Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you're free to choose whichever provider you like. What about Google's One VPN? Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you're a Google Fi subscriber. That said, I don't recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn't trust it to guard your sensitive information.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss",

Server network: Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you'll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada. Customer Service: I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it's available at convenient times in your timezone. Pricing: Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you're comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals. VPN FAQs To wrap up, let's answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don't cover here. What is a VPN? VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, including corporate VPNs like Cisco AnyConnect, Perimeter81 and NordLayer, which are used to access a single network securely. For this list, though, we're talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity. Whenever you get online, you're assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it's possible to create a record of what an individual does online. When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN's servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won't trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN's IP address, not yours. If you're interested in more detail, I've written a whole article on how a VPN works. What are some things VPNs are used for? The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online. One side effect of borrowing a VPN's IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online. Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as certain US states or countries — like the UK — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn't blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN's homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn't mean that authorities can't detect that it's being used in a given location. Are VPNs worth it? Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It's no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world. With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries. What information does a VPN hide? A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship. However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there's nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you're using a VPN. A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can't do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that's concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up. Are VPNs safe? As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there's very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before. All that said, there are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, and others that pretend to be independent services while all secretly working off the same backend. Always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it. Can you get a VPN on your phone? Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you're free to choose whichever provider you like. What about Google's One VPN? Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you're a Google Fi subscriber. That said, I don't recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn't trust it to guard your sensitive information.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss",

It's a great time to get ahold of a virtual private network (VPN) and enjoy worldwide streaming adventures while improving your cybersecurity. By connecting to a VPN every time you get online, you can keep your activity hidden from your ISP and anyone to whom it may sell that data — while streaming sporting events and TV dramas from across the globe. We strongly recommend using a VPN, but shopping for one takes some care. If you jump on the very first deal you see, you might get stuck with a substandard app. It's also easy to end up paying more than you meant to, since otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be. Even with all those conditions, there are some great bargains on the table. Many of the best VPNs — including our top pick, Proton VPN — have deals that save you anywhere from 70 to 87 percent on annual subscriptions. If you can believe it, there are even Valentine's Day sales running right now, because nothing is more romantic than taking care of your online privacy. Best VPN deals ExpressVPN Basic — $68.40 for a two-year subscription with four months free (81 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This discount, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 81 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price. ExpressVPN Advanced — $88.00 for a two-year subscription with four months free (77 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. As above, note that it renews at $119.95 annually. NordVPN Basic — $81.36 for a two-year subscription (70 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. NordVPN includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This deal gives you 70 percent off the two-year plan, but note that it renews at $139.08 per year. NordVPN Plus — $93.36 for a two-year subscription (74 percent off): NordVPN has taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. When this plan renews, you'll be paying $179.88 per year. Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark One — $61.83 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with four months free (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 28 months of CyberGhost for 79 percent off the usual price, but it'll renew at $56.94 per year. hide.me — $69.99 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. It also comes with a guarantee that it'll renew at exactly the same length and pricing. Windscribe — $69 for a one-year subscription (32 percent off): It's not nearly as steep a discount as some of the others on this list, but Windscribe was cheap to begin with, so 32 percent off its monthly price is a bigger savings than it might seem. As I just covered in a detailed Windscribe review, it's worth upgrading from the free service to get full access to Windscribe's all-real server network (and remove the free plan's data cap). Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. You can also get a shorter one-year subscription for $40 ($3.33 per month). Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. What makes a good VPN deal Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

          "standfirst": "The rapid viral adoption of Austrian developer Peter Steinberger&#x27;s open source AI assistant OpenClaw in recent weeks has sent enterprises and indie developers into a tizzy.It&#x27;s easy to easy why: OpenClaw is freely available now and offers a powerful means of autonomously completing work and performing tasks across a user&#x27;s entire computer, phone, or even business with natural language prompts that spin up swarms of agents. Since its release in November 2025, it&#x27;s captured the market with over 50 modules and broad integrations — but its \"permissionless\" architecture raised alarms among developers and security teams. Enter NanoClaw, a lighter, more secure version which debuted under an open source MIT License on January 31, 2026, and achieved explosive growth—surpassing 7,000 stars on GitHub in just over a week. Created by Gavriel Cohen—an experienced software engineer who spent seven years at website builder Wix.com—the project was built to address the \"security nightmare\" inherent in complex, non-sandboxed agent frameworks. Cohen and his brother Lazer are also co-founders of Qwibit, a new AI-first go-to-market agency, and vice president and CEO, respectively, of Concrete Media, a respected public relations firm that often works with tech businesses covered by VentureBeat. NanoClaw’s immediate solution to this architectural anxiety is a hard pivot toward operating system-level isolation. The project places every agent inside isolated Linux containers—utilizing Apple Containers for high-performance execution on macOS or Docker for Linux environments. This creates a strictly \"sandboxed\" environment where the AI only interacts with directories explicitly mounted by the user. While other frameworks build internal \"safeguards\" or application-level allowlists to block certain commands, Gavriel maintains that such defenses are inherently fragile. \"I&#x27;m not running that on my machine and letting an agent run wild,\" Cohen explained during a recent technical interview. \"There&#x27;s always going to be a way out if you’re running directly on the host machine. In NanoClaw, the &#x27;blast radius&#x27; of a potential prompt injection is strictly confined to the container and its specific communication channel.\"A more secure foundation for agentic autonomyThe technical critique at the heart of NanoClaw’s development is one of bloat and auditability. When Cohen first evaluated OpenClaw (formerly Clawbot), he discovered a codebase approaching 400,000 lines with hundreds of dependencies. In the fast-moving AI landscape, such complexity is an engineering hurdle and a potential liability. \"As a developer, every open source dependency that we added to our codebase, you vet. You look at how many stars it has, who are the maintainers, and if it has a proper process in place,\" Cohen notes. \"When you have a codebase with half a million lines of code, nobody&#x27;s reviewing that. It breaks the concept of what people rely on with open source\".NanoClaw counters this by reducing the core logic to roughly 500 lines of TypeScript. This minimalism ensures that the entire system—from the state management to the agent invocation—can be audited by a human or a secondary AI in roughly eight minutes. The architecture employs a single-process Node.js orchestrator that manages a per-group message queue with concurrency control. Instead of heavy distributed message brokers, it relies on SQLite for lightweight persistence and filesystem-based IPC. This design choice is intentional: by using simple primitives, the system remains transparent and reproducible.Furthermore, the isolation extends beyond just the filesystem. NanoClaw natively supports Agent Swarms via the Anthropic Agent SDK, allowing specialized agents to collaborate in parallel. In this model, each sub-agent in a swarm can be isolated with its own specific memory context, preventing sensitive data from leaking between different chat groups or business functions.The product vision: Skills over featuresOne of the most radical departures in NanoClaw is its rejection of the traditional \"feature-rich\" software model. Cohen describes NanoClaw as \"AI-native\" software—a system designed to be managed and extended primarily through AI interaction rather than manual configuration. The project explicitly discourages contributors from submitting PRs that add broad features like Slack or Discord support to the main branch. Instead, they are encouraged to contribute \"Skills\"—modular instructions housed in .claude/skills/ that teach a developer&#x27;s local AI assistant how to transform the code.\"If you want Telegram, rip out the WhatsApp and put in Telegram,\" Cohen says. \"Every person should have exactly the code they need to run their agent. It’s not a Swiss Army knife; it’s a secure harness that you customize by talking to Claude Code\". This \"Skills over Features\" model means that a user can run a command like /add-telegram or /add-gmail, and the AI will rewrite the local installation to integrate the new capability while keeping the codebase lean. This methodology ensures that if a user only needs a WhatsApp-based assistant, they aren&#x27;t forced to inherit the security vulnerabilities of fifty other unused modules.Real-world utility in an AI-native agencyThis isn&#x27;t merely a theoretical experiment for the Cohen brothers. Their new AI go-to-market agency Qwibit uses NanoClaw—specifically a personal instance named \"Andy\"—to run its internal operations. \"Andy manages our sales pipeline for us. I don&#x27;t interact with the sales pipeline directly,\" Cohen explained. The agent provides Sunday-through-Friday briefings at 9:00 AM, detailing lead statuses and assigning tasks to the team.The utility lies in the friction-less capture of data. Throughout the day, Lazer and Gavriel forward messy WhatsApp notes or email threads into their admin group. Andy parses these inputs, updates the relevant files in an Obsidian vault or SQLite database, and sets automated follow-up reminders. Because the agent has access to the codebase, it can also be tasked with recurring technical jobs, such as reviewing git history for \"documentation drift\" or refactoring its own functions to improve ergonomics for future agents.Strategic evaluation for the enterpriseAs the pace of change accelerates in early 2026, technical decision-makers are faced with a fundamental choice between convenience and control. For AI engineers focused on rapid deployment, NanoClaw offers a blueprint for what Cohen calls the \"best harness\" for the \"best model\". By building on top of the Claude Agent SDK, NanoClaw provides a pathway to leverage state-of-the-art models (like Opus 4.6) within a framework that a lean engineering team can actually maintain and optimize.From the perspective of orchestration engineers, NanoClaw’s simplicity is its greatest asset for building scalable, reliable pipelines. Traditional, bloated frameworks often introduce budget-draining overhead through complex microservices and message queues. NanoClaw’s container-first approach allows for the implementation of advanced AI technologies—including autonomous swarms—without the resource constraints and \"technical debt\" associated with 400,000-line legacy systems.Perhaps most critically, for security leaders, NanoClaw addresses the \"multiple responsibilities\" of incident response and organizational protection. In an environment where prompt injection and data exfiltration are evolving daily, a 500-line auditable core is far safer than a generic system trying to support every use case. \"I recommend you send the repository link to your security team and ask them to audit it,\" Cohen advises. \"They can review it in an afternoon—not just read the code, but whiteboard the entire system, map out the attack vectors, and verify it’s safe\".Ultimately, NanoClaw represents a shift in the AI developer mindset. It is an argument that as AI becomes more powerful, the software that hosts it should become simpler. In the race to automate the enterprise, the winners may not be those who adopt the most features, but those who build upon the most transparent and secure foundations.",

Cohen and his brother Lazer are also co-founders of Qwibit, a new AI-first go-to-market agency, and vice president and CEO, respectively, of Concrete Media, a respected public relations firm that often works with tech businesses covered by VentureBeat. NanoClaw’s immediate solution to this architectural anxiety is a hard pivot toward operating system-level isolation. The project places every agent inside isolated Linux containers—utilizing Apple Containers for high-performance execution on macOS or Docker for Linux environments. This creates a strictly \"sandboxed\" environment where the AI only interacts with directories explicitly mounted by the user. While other frameworks build internal \"safeguards\" or application-level allowlists to block certain commands, Gavriel maintains that such defenses are inherently fragile. \"I&#x27;m not running that on my machine and letting an agent run wild,\" Cohen explained during a recent technical interview. \"There&#x27;s always going to be a way out if you’re running directly on the host machine. In NanoClaw, the &#x27;blast radius&#x27; of a potential prompt injection is strictly confined to the container and its specific communication channel.\"A more secure foundation for agentic autonomyThe technical critique at the heart of NanoClaw’s development is one of bloat and auditability. When Cohen first evaluated OpenClaw (formerly Clawbot), he discovered a codebase approaching 400,000 lines with hundreds of dependencies. In the fast-moving AI landscape, such complexity is an engineering hurdle and a potential liability. \"As a developer, every open source dependency that we added to our codebase, you vet. You look at how many stars it has, who are the maintainers, and if it has a proper process in place,\" Cohen notes. \"When you have a codebase with half a million lines of code, nobody&#x27;s reviewing that. It breaks the concept of what people rely on with open source\".NanoClaw counters this by reducing the core logic to roughly 500 lines of TypeScript. This minimalism ensures that the entire system—from the state management to the agent invocation—can be audited by a human or a secondary AI in roughly eight minutes. The architecture employs a single-process Node.js orchestrator that manages a per-group message queue with concurrency control. Instead of heavy distributed message brokers, it relies on SQLite for lightweight persistence and filesystem-based IPC. This design choice is intentional: by using simple primitives, the system remains transparent and reproducible.Furthermore, the isolation extends beyond just the filesystem. NanoClaw natively supports Agent Swarms via the Anthropic Agent SDK, allowing specialized agents to collaborate in parallel. In this model, each sub-agent in a swarm can be isolated with its own specific memory context, preventing sensitive data from leaking between different chat groups or business functions.The product vision: Skills over featuresOne of the most radical departures in NanoClaw is its rejection of the traditional \"feature-rich\" software model. Cohen describes NanoClaw as \"AI-native\" software—a system designed to be managed and extended primarily through AI interaction rather than manual configuration. The project explicitly discourages contributors from submitting PRs that add broad features like Slack or Discord support to the main branch. Instead, they are encouraged to contribute \"Skills\"—modular instructions housed in .claude/skills/ that teach a developer&#x27;s local AI assistant how to transform the code.\"If you want Telegram, rip out the WhatsApp and put in Telegram,\" Cohen says. \"Every person should have exactly the code they need to run their agent. It’s not a Swiss Army knife; it’s a secure harness that you customize by talking to Claude Code\". This \"Skills over Features\" model means that a user can run a command like /add-telegram or /add-gmail, and the AI will rewrite the local installation to integrate the new capability while keeping the codebase lean. This methodology ensures that if a user only needs a WhatsApp-based assistant, they aren&#x27;t forced to inherit the security vulnerabilities of fifty other unused modules.Real-world utility in an AI-native agencyThis isn&#x27;t merely a theoretical experiment for the Cohen brothers. Their new AI go-to-market agency Qwibit uses NanoClaw—specifically a personal instance named \"Andy\"—to run its internal operations. \"Andy manages our sales pipeline for us. I don&#x27;t interact with the sales pipeline directly,\" Cohen explained. The agent provides Sunday-through-Friday briefings at 9:00 AM, detailing lead statuses and assigning tasks to the team.The utility lies in the friction-less capture of data. Throughout the day, Lazer and Gavriel forward messy WhatsApp notes or email threads into their admin group. Andy parses these inputs, updates the relevant files in an Obsidian vault or SQLite database, and sets automated follow-up reminders. Because the agent has access to the codebase, it can also be tasked with recurring technical jobs, such as reviewing git history for \"documentation drift\" or refactoring its own functions to improve ergonomics for future agents.Strategic evaluation for the enterpriseAs the pace of change accelerates in early 2026, technical decision-makers are faced with a fundamental choice between convenience and control. For AI engineers focused on rapid deployment, NanoClaw offers a blueprint for what Cohen calls the \"best harness\" for the \"best model\". By building on top of the Claude Agent SDK, NanoClaw provides a pathway to leverage state-of-the-art models (like Opus 4.6) within a framework that a lean engineering team can actually maintain and optimize.From the perspective of orchestration engineers, NanoClaw’s simplicity is its greatest asset for building scalable, reliable pipelines. Traditional, bloated frameworks often introduce budget-draining overhead through complex microservices and message queues. NanoClaw’s container-first approach allows for the implementation of advanced AI technologies—including autonomous swarms—without the resource constraints and \"technical debt\" associated with 400,000-line legacy systems.Perhaps most critically, for security leaders, NanoClaw addresses the \"multiple responsibilities\" of incident response and organizational protection. In an environment where prompt injection and data exfiltration are evolving daily, a 500-line auditable core is far safer than a generic system trying to support every use case. \"I recommend you send the repository link to your security team and ask them to audit it,\" Cohen advises. \"They can review it in an afternoon—not just read the code, but whiteboard the entire system, map out the attack vectors, and verify it’s safe\".Ultimately, NanoClaw represents a shift in the AI developer mindset. It is an argument that as AI becomes more powerful, the software that hosts it should become simpler. In the race to automate the enterprise, the winners may not be those who adopt the most features, but those who build upon the most transparent and secure foundations.",

          "standfirst": "Presidents’ Day is a great time to buy appliances, mattresses and furniture as they are often on sale for the holiday. Tech also gets discounted around this time, but you have to do a bit more digging to find actually good deals. And this year, Presidents’ Day comes right after Valentine’s Day and Super Bowl 2026, which means there are some overlapping sales to consider. If you don’t want to sort through the mess of bad deals out there, Engadget has you covered. We’re curating the best President Day sales on tech we can find right here. We’ll update this post through the holiday as more deals become available. Presidents’ Day deals under $50 Disney+ and Hulu bundle (one month) for $10 ($3 off): You can get one month of Disney+ and Hulu access for only $10 right now. That represents a small savings over the standard $13-per-month price for the bundle, but a 58-percent discount when you compare it to the price of paying for both services separately. It’s a good way to test out the bundle without paying too much before you decide if you want to subscribe for the long haul. Anker Nano 45W USB-C charger for $30 ($10 off): Anker’s latest 45W charger has a small smart display on it that can show you real-time charging stats.

          "standfirst": "Pokémon Pokopia can be described as a pocket monster-themed take on Animal Crossing with a hint of Stardew Valley thrown in for good measure. And if you're like me, that alone is probably enough to sell you on the game. However, after getting a chance to play a preview of it for around half an hour, it became immediately clear that the game's coziness levels are off the charts, but it also offers some fun twists on the genre.Co-developed by The Pokémon Company, GAME FREAK and KOEI TECMO, instead of playing as a generic trainer, you take control of a lonely Ditto who wakes up in a cave only to be greeted by Professor Tangrowth, the last surviving inhabitant of what used to be a bustling town. While the professor might look like an extra-large version of the original pokémon with glasses, its role is to guide you as you rebuild and hopefully repopulate the surrounding area.One of the best things about Pokopia is actually being able to talk to the other 'mons.NintendoAs a Ditto, you naturally have the ability to transform into other Pokémon, though the process is sort of incomplete, meaning you can only learn one skill from the monsters you befriend instead of their entire moveset like in the mainline games. This is where the first twist on the traditional life sim comes in. Instead of crafting them or earning money to buy tools, you can transform into other Pokémon (like Lapras or Dragonite) to use their abilities to traverse obstacles or shape the world around you. For example, turning into a Squirtle lets you shoot a water gun that will revitalize dry patches or thirsty plants, while transforming into a Scyther lets you slice through objects similar to the HM Cut. From there, you can use these skills to do things like create clusters of shrubs that will serve as homes for other Pokémon, allowing you to entice fellow creatures to return to the once desolate landscape. Another twist I really appreciate is that after appearing, new monsters will give you quests or just hang out. They will even talk and respond, and I don't mean like the 8-bit cries from other Pokémon games. They speak in full sentences, which is a wonderful departure from previous titles that really gives you the feeling that you're making friends and rebuilding a community instead of just being on a crusade to catch them all. The Stardew Valley part of the equation comes into play after you leave the first tutorial area and you come upon an abandoned Pokémon Center that's in dire need of a renovation. You can do things like collect materials and do more quests to clean up the area to eventually turn the building in the heart of the town. Unfortunately, that's where my preview ended, aside from quickly hopping into a multiplayer session where I was able to see a much more developed village, complete with multiple buildings, roads and benches. You know, all the sorts of things you used to furnish and decorate your island with in Animal Crossing. This gave me a nice glimpse at just how many things you can build in Pokopia and how easy it is to visit other people's towns. However, it didn't answer some of my bigger questions about the game, like what's the deal with Peakychu and Mosslax, whom we've seen before in previous trailers. Are they just one-off versions of existing ‘mons with unusual typings (i.e. ghost and grass) only for this game, or are they going to be a bigger part of the Pokémon world going forward? Perhaps more importantly, it was hard to tell if there will be any sort of PVE content like The Mines or Skull Cavern in Stardew Valley. I'm really hoping there is because it seems like Ditto's abilities could translate quite seamlessly to spelunking or battling your way through dungeons in search of rare items or building materials. I love how derpy Ditto looks when it transforms into other Pokémon. NintendoThat said, just being able to build a community of friendly monsters while injecting life back into a forgotten town has good vibes radiating from every corner. So if you need a super cozy game to keep you busy this winter/spring, Pokémon Pokopia is shaping up to be the digital version of a fluffy blanket and a cup of hot chocolate filled to the brim with all of your favorite 'mons. Pokémon Pokopia is available for pre-order now, with official sales slated for March 5.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/pokemon-pokopia-is-so-damn-cozy-140000954.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Mullvad VPN review: Near-total privacy with a few sacrifices",
          "standfirst": "Mullvad, a virtual private network (VPN) named after the Swedish word for \"mole,\" is often recognized as one of the best VPNs for privacy. I put it on my best VPN list for exactly that reason. I've got huge respect for the extra lengths Mullvad goes to in order to ensure its user's privacy. To give you a preview, Mullvad is one of the few VPNs — other than my normal privacy recommendation, Proton VPN — that lets users pay entirely in cash. But even Proton VPN asks for an email address to make an account and uses a few marketing cookies on its own website. Mullvad represents every account as a randomly generated 16-digit code and uses no marketing cookies whatsoever. That's just one example of how Mullvad goes beyond the call of duty to keep users private. But while privacy is the most important aspect of a VPN alongside security, it's not the only thing that matters. For this review, I set out to investigate whether Mullvad pairs its rights-protecting bonafides with versatile, convenient and enjoyable VPN apps. Using our rigorous VPN testing procedure, I'll rate Mullvad in 11 areas. You can find a summary of my results in the table below, skip to the sections that matter most to you or just read my final advice in the conclusion. Editor's note (2/11/26): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews. Check out how we test VPNs to learn more about the new standards we're using. Findings at a glance Category Notes Installation and UI All apps share roughly the same user interfaceApps are responsive and easy to navigate, with no design choices that would threaten beginnersLack of \"fastest server\" button is an issueBrowser extension is only available on Firefox and still in beta Speed Reasonably good average latencyReduces download speeds by 26 percent and upload speeds by 17 percentSpeed declines are consistent and chartableAll speed metrics are quite good on nearby servers Security Only uses WireGuard protocolNo IP address leaks, even when switching serversPacket test showed successful encryption Pricing Always costs 5 Euro per month, though prices outside Europe depend on exchange ratesNo auto-renewal — membership lasts until money runs outCan pay using cash or by purchasing scratch-off vouchers on Amazon14 day money-back guarantee, except on cash payments Bundles Only app besides the VPN is the free Mullvad Browser, which removes the tracking habits of typical web browsersAllows several smaller VPNs to use its servers in their networks Privacy policy No vague lines or loopholes in privacy policyOnly saves account numbers and expiration dates for each userUses an extremely limited range of cookies with no marketing trackersHas undergone a total of 17 audits of different aspects of its serviceSwedish police demanded customer information in 2023; Mullvad couldn't comply because the data wasn't logged Virtual location change Unblocked Netflix 13 out of 15 timesWhen it failed, virtual location was still changed Server network 90 locations in 50 countries, majority in North America and EuropeNo virtual servers whatsoever Features DAITA conceals traffic patterns that might let an AI identify what sites you visitUses quantum-resistant encryption on WireGuardCan choose your own multihop entry and exit pointsSeveral options for getting around nation-level firewallsCan block ads, trackers, malware and other unwanted content using predetermined DNS block listsSupports IPv6 trafficKill switch and stronger lockdown modeSplit tunneling by app Customer support Help center includes useful filters to find the topicWell-written articles with good internal linkingNo live chat support, but staff answers emails quicklyCan view app logs at any time Background check Founded in 2009 in Sweden; still owned and operated by initial foundersUser account numbers were exposed in a 2023 incident, but Mullvad quickly closed the leak Installing, configuring and using Mullvad Let's start by examining how Mullvad feels as a piece of software. In this section, I'll be testing its desktop apps for Windows and Mac, its mobile apps for Android and iOS and its browser extension for Firefox. To start with the installation process, Mullvad downloads and installs in a snap on mobile. On desktop, installation requires a few more steps than is typical, but the app guides you quickly through everything. Across the board, my only serious complaint is that there's no option for automatically choosing the fastest server. You can usually assume that the nearest one to you will be the fastest, but there's always the chance of an unusual server overload. It's a bizarre oversight for an app that otherwise goes out of its way to be usable. Windows Mullvad's Windows app has a slim UI that uses space efficiently without being too cramped. It doesn't give you a lot of information, such as live speed tests or data in transit, but I've mostly found that to be needless filler on VPN apps. Mullvad on Windows. Sam Chapman for Engadget Speaking of needless filler, the map may be a little bigger than it needs to be, but maps on VPN clients aren't just about teaching you geography — they do a lot to make the apps more welcoming to casual users who might not otherwise fire up security software. In fact, Mullvad's UI is admirably beginner-friendly, befitting its focus on privacy for everybody rather than just the tech-savvy. All the settings are accessed by clicking the gear in the top-right. Here, you can turn on DAITA (Mullvad's defense against AI traffic scanning), activate multihop and control Mullvad's other features. There are also some quality-of-life features for the UI itself, such as whether it remains pinned to the taskbar or operates as a standalone window. Some options, especially under the VPN settings tab, are a bit technical, but don't need to be touched for a good experience. Mac Mullvad's macOS app is quite similar to its Windows app, both in terms of the interface and the features offered. The big difference used to be that macOS lacked split tunneling, but that's been added in a recent update. The only serious distinction now is that the Mac client can't be unpinned from the taskbar, which is just a little bothersome. Mullvad on Mac. Sam Chapman for Engadget Other than that, you'll find every setting you need under the gear, just like on Windows. Similarly, connections to VPN servers happen quickly, and selecting locations from the menu is very straightforward. While connected on either app, you can click the circular arrow by your location to swap to another server in the same location — highly convenient if you're trying to unblock Netflix. Android Mullvad's Android app has the same nearly-perfect design approach as all its other apps. The main page has nothing on it but the connect/disconnect button, the choice of server locations, a map and the buttons for your account information and preferences. Those preferences are a manageable set of options that are almost all managed with simple on-off switches. It's all highly responsive and annoyance-free. Mullvad on Android. Sam Chapman for Engadget iOS Mullvad's iOS app looks very similar to its apps on every other platform. The front page is kept simple, with large controls in the foreground and a map taking up most of the space. Everything else is located in the menu accessed through the gear icon at top right. Neither mobile app has the options for toggling the UI itself that the desktop apps have, but it's mostly free of quality-of-life problems to start with. Mullvad on iPhone. Sam Chapman for Engadget Browser extensions Mullvad's browser extension is only compatible with Firefox. You can't actually connect to the VPN through this extension. Its main functions are to tell you whether you're connected to a Mullvad server and to connect to a SOCKS5 proxy in a Mullvad location. If you do this while connected to Mullvad through the desktop app, you'll get a second layer of protection, similar to the multi-hop feature. The Firefox extension is a rare misfire for Mullvad — perhaps fair, since it's still in beta. Its only real feature is something that the desktop app already does perfectly well, and it looks like a software malfunction to boot. However, given Mullvad's track record, I'm confident they'll figure out what to do with it in time. Mullvad speed test A VPN almost always slows browsing speeds and increases latencies. It's unavoidable, given the extra steps a VPN protocol adds to the process of getting online. The trick is to find VPNs that keep the slowdown to a minimum, using a combination of regular maintenance, good planning and smart load balancing. For this test, I used speedtest.net to check how six of Mullvad's server locations influenced three key speed metrics. Ping measures latency, the time in milliseconds (ms) that one data packet needs to travel between a client device and an ISP. Download speed measures the amount of data in Megabits that a web browser can download in one second. Upload speed tracks how much data can be uploaded in a second. We're looking for low latencies and high download and upload speeds. Server location Ping (ms) Increase factor Download speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Upload speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Portland, USA (unprotected) 15 — 58.96 — 5.85 — Seattle, USA (fastest location) 23 1.5x 55.07 6.6 5.51 5.8 Montreal, Canada 165 11.0x 44.28 24.9 4.62 21.0 Fortaleza, Brazil 307 20.5x 40.96 30.5 4.65 20.5 Prague, Czechia 368 24.5x 43.17 26.8 5.47 6.5 Lagos, Nigeria 528 35.2x 37.41 36.6 4.61 21.2 Bangkok, Thailand 473 31.5x 39.76 32.6 4.13 29.4 Average 311 20.7x 43.44 26.3 4.83 17.4 I'll start with the bad news: the tests didn't exactly make Mullvad look like a speed demon. Its speeds have gone up and down in the years I've been using it, and right now they appear to be on the downswing. If you use locations all around Mullvad's server network, you can expect your download speeds to decrease by about 26 percent and your upload speeds to decline by 17 percent. However, it's important to put those numbers in perspective. First, Mullvad's numbers aren't markedly worse than the ones I got when testing CyberGhost. Its speeds are average, but by definition, most things are average. Its average worldwide latency is actually better than Surfshark, the current champion of download and upload speeds. Speed-testing a Mullvad server in Los Angeles. Sam Chapman for Engadget It's also nice that Mullvad's speed drops follow a predictable curve. Lots of VPNs have unexpectedly sharp declines in certain locations, frequently in Africa. By contrast, Mullvad's speed decreases pretty much as a direct function of how far from the server you are. This not only makes speed drops easier to plan around, but also means you can expect very good speeds on nearby servers. This property of being fastest on servers near the user is another sign of Mullvad's focus on its core privacy mission. If anonymity is your main reason for using a VPN, it doesn't matter what your IP address is, so long as it's not your real one. Using a nearby Mullvad server should guarantee you an internet connection that's both fast and private. Mullvad security test To be secure, a VPN has to check two critical boxes. It must provide you with a secondary IP address without leaking your real one, and it must encrypt your communications with its servers so your activity can't be traced. In the sections below, I'll see whether Mullvad meets those requirements. VPN protocols VPNs use protocols to mediate between end devices, ISPs and their own servers. The first step is to ensure that the service you're considering uses protocols that have expert confidence. Mullvad has kindly made this step easy for me by using only WireGuard on all its apps, with no OpenVPN, IKEv2 or in-house unique protocols. There's no question that WireGuard is a solid protocol. It uses the ChaCha20 stream cipher for symmetric encryption and Poly1305 for authentication, both uncrackable with current technology. Mullvad has even added its own fix for WireGuard's one flaw, its need to save static IP addresses — the Mullvad implementation is set up to delete the IP address if it goes 10 minutes without being used. Even so, it's unfortunate to lose the ability to change protocols, which is one of the most common steps for troubleshooting a VPN connection. I understand Mullvad's reasoning for cutting out OpenVPN (it claims the cryptography isn't strong enough) but don't agree. It's one of this provider's few unforced errors. Leak test There's a straightforward test to determine if your VPN is leaking. Load up any website that shows your IP address — I personally use ipleak.net — and see what IP and location it reveals without your VPN active. Then activate the VPN and refresh the page. If you see your real IP address anywhere, your VPN is leaking. Testing Mullvad for IP leaks. Sam Chapman for Engadget I ran that test on five Mullvad servers. Each time, the website showed me the IP address of the VPN server, concealing my real one. To keep things simple, I ran the initial tests with IPv6 blocked via the Mullvad client. When I turned it on and tried again, the IPv6 traffic didn't leak any more than the IPv4 did. I also saw no signs of WebRTC leaks. Unless you set up a custom DNS server, Mullvad also uses its own DNS, which remains entirely within the VPN tunnel. I had one more leak test to try. Frequently, VPNs are leak-proof when maintaining a connection to one server but drop encryption when switching between servers. That problem is why I ultimately couldn't recommend Norton VPN. Luckily for me, Mullvad has a button that lets you shuffle to another server in the same location, so I used that to see if it stayed leak-proof. Mullvad doesn't leak your IP even while changing servers. Sam Chapman for Engadget As you can see in the screenshot, Mullvad jumped seamlessly from one server to another without showing my real location in-between. On a practical level, that's enough for me to declare Mullvad leak-proof. Encryption test For one final experiment, I used the WireShark packet sniffer to see whether the data Mullvad sent from my computer to my ISP was encrypted. After capturing a few packets, I was gratified to see that they were totally unreadable to interlopers. Most established VPNs pass this test, but it's still important for due diligence. How much does Mullvad cost? Mullvad's pricing structure is one of the most unusual things about it. This is normally the section where I untangle 47 different Pro+ and Business- accounts that are all sold at three different durations. Mullvad couldn't be further from that. It costs 5 Euro a month — that’s it. Each 5-Euro subscription can be used on five devices at once. It manages payments through a system inspired by parking meters. When you sign up for Mullvad, you'll buy as much time as you want. That time will count down until it expires, unless you top it up with more 5-Euro payments. If you run out of money, Mullvad won't charge you a new subscription fee because you didn't tell it not to. It'll just stop working until you pay again. Every payment also comes with a 14-day money-back guarantee, except for payments made in cash. The Mullvad account dashboard. Sam Chapman for Engadget The only real complexity in the process is that Mullvad always figures out its prices in Euro, so outside the EU, the cost per month is affected by exchange rates. If you happen to live in a country where the government's economic policy shuttles between capricious and arbitrary, you might want to grab a few months in advance. The other most interesting thing about Mullvad's pricing is the options you can use to pay. For maximum privacy, you can pay with cash using the payment token you'll find on your account page. Note that this is not the same as your account number. To find it, log into your dashboard on Mullvad.net, click Add time to your account in the left-hand bar, then click the button labeled Cash and scroll down. Make your cash payment by writing the token on an envelope and mailing it to Sweden (full instructions here). Unredacted, in case any hackers out there want to buy me some more time. Sam Chapman for Engadget You can also get untraceable Mullvad vouchers by paying cash at participating retail locations. Most of them are in Europe, but you can order them from Amazon. While your payment to Amazon won't be private, the voucher can't be linked directly to your VPN account, since the actual number is hidden behind a scratch-off panel. It's actually pretty ingenious. Of course, you can also pay using any of the normal methods, including credit cards, cryptocurrency and bank wires (though not PayPal). But the more private methods are always there for people who need them. Mullvad side apps and bundles Mullvad is that rare VPN that's still content to be a VPN and not an all-inclusive security suite. No shade to NordVPN or Surfshark, whose extra features are generally quite good, but it's nice to see at least one of the top providers staying focused. Although Mullvad doesn't have any partners that sell their products alongside its VPN, it does have several partnerships with other VPNs who use its network as the basis for their own products. MalwareBytes Privacy VPN, Mozilla VPN, Tailscale and Obscura can all be considered Mullvad side apps if you squint. Mullvad Browser Mullvad's only product other than the VPN is Mullvad Browser, which is free to download and works on Windows, macOS and Linux. Mullvad Browser works in the background, blocking common methods of browser fingerprinting that can be used to deduce your identity even when you have a VPN running. For example, it automatically reports your time zone as UTC, disguises personal preferences like font and window size, scrambles information sent by APIs and conceals your browser version and computer operating system. It's also in private mode by default, which doesn't hide what your ISP sees but is useful for concealing your activity from other people that might use your computer. Close-reading Mullvad's privacy policy Since privacy is Mullvad's main selling point, this section is even more important than usual. Loopholes in the privacy policy of the privacy VPN would be deeply ironic. Fortunately, Mullvad's privacy policy backs up its high-flying rhetoric. It's a short, pointed and readable document with no problems I could discern. Mullvad has no parent company or subsidiary it might use as a loophole, and no clauses in its policy are left open to interpretation. It's a masterpiece of the privacy-policy genre. The document is actually three policies: a privacy policy, a no-logging policy and a cookie policy. The privacy policy lists all the times Mullvad might collect data about a user. That's exactly two situations — using financial information to process payments (which will be entirely anonymous if you use cash or a voucher) and using your email address to track support tickets you open. That's it. The no-logging policy is a bit longer, but mostly because it's explaining exactly how Mullvad manages to run a VPN service with so little information on individual users. For each account, it stores a number and an expiration date, plus public keys and tunnel addresses if you're using WireGuard (deleted at most 10 minutes after your session ends). Everything else is completely anonymized. Mullvad even claims that its 500,000 or so user accounts could have been created by the same user 500,000 times, which I suppose is one way to spend 2.5 million Euro. The cookie policy is the shortest because Mullvad uses exactly five cookies. One saves your login status in your browser, one saves your language preferences, one protects its site from being used in a specific kind of forgery hack and the other two are for handling Stripe payments. Independent privacy audits Mullvad corroborates its privacy policy with regular audits of various aspects of its service. Currently, there are 17 audits listed on its website, including four infrastructure audits by Cure53. All of its apps have been separately audited and found to be solid. It has been a couple of years since the last full infrastructure audit in 2024, but given how many other targeted reviews Mullvad has gone through since then, it's hard to be too upset about the pause. In 2023, Mullvad achieved the holy grail of VPN privacy: being ordered by subpoena to turn over customer information and not being able to comply because that information didn't exist. Nothing compares to a VPN's privacy being tested in the wild like this. Can Mullvad change your virtual location? Sometimes, a VPN appears to be working, but still reveals your real location to websites. Netflix is a useful proxy for this. To unblock a streaming site like Netflix, a VPN needs to change your virtual location while not appearing to do so — if Netflix sees any hint of VPN traffic, you'll get blocked with the hated proxy error. I used five different locations to check whether Mullvad is up to the streaming task. Server location Unblocked Netflix? Changed content? Vancouver, Canada 3/3 3/3 Gothenberg, Sweden 2/3 2/3 Istanbul, Turkey 3/3 3/3 Johannesburg, South Africa 3/3 3/3 Singapore, Singapore 2/3 2/3 Mullvad did well for streaming, but it didn't manage a perfect score like its fellow anti-establishment VPN Windscribe did. Two of the 15 servers I tested failed to unblock Netflix, one in Singapore and one in Mullvad's hometown of Gothenburg. I also had trouble logging into Netflix while connected to a Vancouver server, though that server did unblock the site consistently once I got inside. Mullvad's servers all tricked Netflix into believing my new location. Sam Chapman for Engadget In Mullvad's defense, no location failed more than once. It's completely possible to get good streaming performance out of this VPN; you just have to be willing to click the server refresh button a few times. Privacy is still the main use case for Mullvad, but it's fine for streaming too. Investigating Mullvad's server network Mullvad has 90 server locations in 50 countries and territories. Unusually for a VPN, users can choose between all 590 of its total servers, including several in each location. There's even a list on its website that shows you the status of every server. Mullvad does not use virtual server locations, so every server is physically located in the place where it claims to be. Here's how they're distributed. Region Countries with servers Total server locations North America 3 25 South America 5 6 Europe 29 41 Africa 2 2 Middle East 2 2 Asia 7 8 Oceania 2 6 Total 50 90 Over half the countries with servers are in Europe and over two-thirds of the cities with servers are in either Europe or North America. That lopsided network is a limitation of Mullvad's refusal to use virtual server locations, since its real servers have to be concentrated in nations developed enough to host data centers. With an all-real network, it's easier to tell which servers will give you the fastest performance, but you can't simulate as much of the world as you can with larger services like ExpressVPN. The good news is that there's at least two real server locations on every continent. Mullvad has a surprisingly robust presence in South America and two bare-metal servers in Africa, which is more than some other VPNs have. In the end, though, the best application of Mullvad is to protect the online privacy of users in North America, Europe and eastern Asia. Extra features of Mullvad Most of Mullvad's features are augmentations to the VPN itself, rather than side options that do other things. Some of them are bread-and-butter, like the kill switch and split tunneling, but a few you won't find anywhere else. Note beforehand that Mullvad does not support port forwarding, so if you depend on that for your torrenting, try another VPN. DAITA AI defenses Mullvad's most novel feature is a recent one. DAITA, which stands for Defense against AI-guided Traffic Analysis, can be toggled on and off in the Mullvad app. According to Mullvad, certain patterns in how browsers communicate with websites can be analyzed by AI to reveal the truth behind encrypted internet history. DAITA hides those packets by filling communications with background noise so the AI won't know what's real. Mullvad's anti-AI settings. Sam Chapman for Engadget DAITA is a laudably forward-looking feature, but as Mullvad itself admits, it will make your browsing speeds slower and drain your battery. I recommend only using it for activities you really want to hide. Quantum resistance Mullvad's desktop apps establish quantum-proof WireGuard tunnels by default. Quantum computing isn't yet a threat to WireGuard, but it may become dangerous in the future, so Mullvad is getting ahead of the problem (along with a few other services like NordVPN). When quantum resistance is active, Mullvad encapsulates its keys using the current standard mechanism, ML-KEM. Anti-censorship If you find yourself in a country where government censorship makes it hard to access the internet, Mullvad has options that might help. These anti-censorship features can be used to get around firewalls that block visible VPN traffic. You have several options, including changing your WireGuard port, randomizing your port number, disguising your VPN traffic as an ordinary HTTPS connection or using an obfuscated Shadowsocks proxy. Mullvad's anti-censorship involves more features than most VPNs have in this area. This makes it a bit less user-friendly, but a lot more likely to work. If you're new to getting around censorship, Mullvad's help center has a helpful page about using its anti-censor settings. Multihop Many VPNs offer a double-hop connection that routes your traffic through two servers instead of one, adding a redundant layer of encryption in case one server malfunctions. Mullvad pulls ahead of the competition (except Surfshark, which also does this) by allowing you to choose your entry and exit servers. When you activate the multihop option and open the server list, you'll be prompted to pick two locations instead of one. Mullvad's server list with multihop enabled. Sam Chapman for Engadget This means you can select an entry server that's close to you and an exit server in any country whose location you want to spoof, letting you fine-tune your own performance. It's way nicer than being railroaded into certain paths. DNS content blockers Mullvad includes six blocklists that can keep you or your family members from looking at unwanted content: ads, trackers, malware, gambling, adult content and social media. These lists can't be customized like Windscribe's R.O.B.E.R.T. blocks can, so you're limited to just turning them on and off. IPv6 support The internet is gradually transitioning from the old IPv4 standard over to IPv6, which will allow many more addresses to be shared out. Mullvad is one of a few VPNs looking ahead to the IPv6 era. You can leave it to block all IPv6 traffic, but if you do need IPv6 for any reason, you can enable it while still being connected to a Mullvad server. Kill switch and lockdown mode Mullvad comes with two features that protect against unexpectedly losing your VPN defenses. The first is a kill switch, a common VPN option that cuts off internet access if the VPN tunnel ever fails. This simple measure helps guard against accidental leaks. Lockdown mode is the stronger option. While it's active, you will be unable to get on the internet unless you connect to a Mullvad server first. This will remain true if you turn the connection off yourself and even if you quit the app. Split tunneling Split tunneling is available on Mullvad's apps for every system except iOS. It lets you send some apps outside the VPN tunnel so they get online with your normal IP address. It's helpful if you have some apps that don't work with the VPN active — this is common with online banking, as an example. Another common application is to protect a torrenting client in the background while using your browser unprotected for better speeds. Mullvad customer support options Mullvad makes two forms of support available in the app. You can report a problem by going to Settings -> Support -> Report a problem, typing your question (requested to be in either English or Swedish, though they'd probably be able to read a question run through Google Translate) and optionally providing your email. You can also view the app's logs at any time, which can be useful to help a technician diagnose your problem. If you'd rather search for a solution at your own pace, you can go to that same page and click FAQs and Guides instead. This opens the help center in a browser. Mullvad's help center, including the dropdown filter menus. Sam Chapman for Engadget I love Mullvad's approach to laying out its FAQs. Instead of crowding topics into five or six categories and making you guess whether your problem falls under setup, usage or troubleshooting, Mullvad gives you a set of dropdown filters to narrow down the articles which might relate to your problem. By the time you've named which device, OS and protocol you're dealing with, you won’t have many articles left to sift through. There is an annoying tendency for certain sets of filters to reduce the number of surfaced links to zero, but for those cases, there's a search bar that also works well. The articles themselves are good enough that I referred to them several times while writing this review. Some of them are a bit overlong, but they're diligent about including both internal and external links to get you where you're going fast. Live support experience This is normally where I cover how it feels to get live chat support from the VPN I'm reviewing. However, Mullvad doesn't have live chat support. That's unfortunate, although it's still better than Windscribe's approach of forcing you to banter with a sarcastic robot. Instead, I sent a question via email to Mullvad's support team, and got a response within 24 hours. Mullvad background check Mullvad was founded in 2009 in Sweden. It's still owned and operated by its original founders. According to a detailed timeline on its website, its 16-year history has been as uneventful as any user could ask for, with not much changing except updates to stay on the technological leading edge. The only controversy mentioned in Mullvad's own materials is the 2023 police raid of its headquarters, which (as I covered in the privacy section) only makes them look better. So as not to take Mullvad at its word, I scoured the last 16 years of news items and user reports to search for any other blemishes on its record. Based on that research, I found no reason to doubt Mullvad's honesty about its location, owners or team. I found just one leak that wasn't noted on Mullvad's own site. In 2023, a security research group called ZATAZ alleged that it found anonymized information on Mullvad users saved on an Internet Archive page, including account numbers (linked article is in French). According to ZATAZ, Mullvad contacted the Archive and got the page deleted. To my mind, the only mistake Mullvad made in response to the ZATAZ allegations was not making a public statement about the incident. I can see why they didn't think it was a big deal, since even logging into someone else's Mullvad account wouldn't show you their browsing history, but it's always better to communicate about these things. Final verdict Mullvad is a VPN that knows what it wants to be and achieves that goal with flying colors. It's not trying to be an everything app — it does privacy and does it well. That's not to say it has nothing going on outside the VPN itself, as its DNS blockers, AI defenses and split tunneling all work smoothly. But if you want a VPN that's not ashamed to be a VPN, Mullvad is the right choice. Of course, it has its own compromises. It's solidly in the middle of the speed pack and occasionally trips up when unblocking streaming sites. The lack of any protocols other than WireGuard grates on me a bit, since it reduces the user's options for troubleshooting. With all that said, those are minor hiccups on a VPN that does such a thorough job keeping you anonymous online.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/mullvad-vpn-review-near-total-privacy-with-a-few-sacrifices-130000056.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Mullvad, a virtual private network (VPN) named after the Swedish word for \"mole,\" is often recognized as one of the best VPNs for privacy. I put it on my best VPN list for exactly that reason. I've got huge respect for the extra lengths Mullvad goes to in order to ensure its user's privacy. To give you a preview, Mullvad is one of the few VPNs — other than my normal privacy recommendation, Proton VPN — that lets users pay entirely in cash. But even Proton VPN asks for an email address to make an account and uses a few marketing cookies on its own website. Mullvad represents every account as a randomly generated 16-digit code and uses no marketing cookies whatsoever. That's just one example of how Mullvad goes beyond the call of duty to keep users private. But while privacy is the most important aspect of a VPN alongside security, it's not the only thing that matters. For this review, I set out to investigate whether Mullvad pairs its rights-protecting bonafides with versatile, convenient and enjoyable VPN apps. Using our rigorous VPN testing procedure, I'll rate Mullvad in 11 areas. You can find a summary of my results in the table below, skip to the sections that matter most to you or just read my final advice in the conclusion. Editor's note (2/11/26): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews. Check out how we test VPNs to learn more about the new standards we're using.

In this section, I'll be testing its desktop apps for Windows and Mac, its mobile apps for Android and iOS and its browser extension for Firefox. To start with the installation process, Mullvad downloads and installs in a snap on mobile. On desktop, installation requires a few more steps than is typical, but the app guides you quickly through everything. Across the board, my only serious complaint is that there's no option for automatically choosing the fastest server. You can usually assume that the nearest one to you will be the fastest, but there's always the chance of an unusual server overload. It's a bizarre oversight for an app that otherwise goes out of its way to be usable. Windows Mullvad's Windows app has a slim UI that uses space efficiently without being too cramped. It doesn't give you a lot of information, such as live speed tests or data in transit, but I've mostly found that to be needless filler on VPN apps. Mullvad on Windows. Sam Chapman for Engadget Speaking of needless filler, the map may be a little bigger than it needs to be, but maps on VPN clients aren't just about teaching you geography — they do a lot to make the apps more welcoming to casual users who might not otherwise fire up security software. In fact, Mullvad's UI is admirably beginner-friendly, befitting its focus on privacy for everybody rather than just the tech-savvy. All the settings are accessed by clicking the gear in the top-right. Here, you can turn on DAITA (Mullvad's defense against AI traffic scanning), activate multihop and control Mullvad's other features. There are also some quality-of-life features for the UI itself, such as whether it remains pinned to the taskbar or operates as a standalone window. Some options, especially under the VPN settings tab, are a bit technical, but don't need to be touched for a good experience. Mac Mullvad's macOS app is quite similar to its Windows app, both in terms of the interface and the features offered. The big difference used to be that macOS lacked split tunneling, but that's been added in a recent update. The only serious distinction now is that the Mac client can't be unpinned from the taskbar, which is just a little bothersome. Mullvad on Mac. Sam Chapman for Engadget Other than that, you'll find every setting you need under the gear, just like on Windows. Similarly, connections to VPN servers happen quickly, and selecting locations from the menu is very straightforward. While connected on either app, you can click the circular arrow by your location to swap to another server in the same location — highly convenient if you're trying to unblock Netflix. Android Mullvad's Android app has the same nearly-perfect design approach as all its other apps. The main page has nothing on it but the connect/disconnect button, the choice of server locations, a map and the buttons for your account information and preferences. Those preferences are a manageable set of options that are almost all managed with simple on-off switches. It's all highly responsive and annoyance-free. Mullvad on Android. Sam Chapman for Engadget iOS Mullvad's iOS app looks very similar to its apps on every other platform. The front page is kept simple, with large controls in the foreground and a map taking up most of the space. Everything else is located in the menu accessed through the gear icon at top right. Neither mobile app has the options for toggling the UI itself that the desktop apps have, but it's mostly free of quality-of-life problems to start with. Mullvad on iPhone. Sam Chapman for Engadget Browser extensions Mullvad's browser extension is only compatible with Firefox. You can't actually connect to the VPN through this extension. Its main functions are to tell you whether you're connected to a Mullvad server and to connect to a SOCKS5 proxy in a Mullvad location. If you do this while connected to Mullvad through the desktop app, you'll get a second layer of protection, similar to the multi-hop feature. The Firefox extension is a rare misfire for Mullvad — perhaps fair, since it's still in beta. Its only real feature is something that the desktop app already does perfectly well, and it looks like a software malfunction to boot. However, given Mullvad's track record, I'm confident they'll figure out what to do with it in time. Mullvad speed test A VPN almost always slows browsing speeds and increases latencies. It's unavoidable, given the extra steps a VPN protocol adds to the process of getting online. The trick is to find VPNs that keep the slowdown to a minimum, using a combination of regular maintenance, good planning and smart load balancing. For this test, I used speedtest.net to check how six of Mullvad's server locations influenced three key speed metrics. Ping measures latency, the time in milliseconds (ms) that one data packet needs to travel between a client device and an ISP. Download speed measures the amount of data in Megabits that a web browser can download in one second. Upload speed tracks how much data can be uploaded in a second. We're looking for low latencies and high download and upload speeds. Server location Ping (ms) Increase factor Download speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Upload speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Portland, USA (unprotected) 15 — 58.96 — 5.85 — Seattle, USA (fastest location) 23 1.5x 55.07 6.6 5.51 5.8 Montreal, Canada 165 11.0x 44.28 24.9 4.62 21.0 Fortaleza, Brazil 307 20.5x 40.96 30.5 4.65 20.5 Prague, Czechia 368 24.5x 43.17 26.8 5.47 6.5 Lagos, Nigeria 528 35.2x 37.41 36.6 4.61 21.2 Bangkok, Thailand 473 31.5x 39.76 32.6 4.13 29.4 Average 311 20.7x 43.44 26.3 4.83 17.4 I'll start with the bad news: the tests didn't exactly make Mullvad look like a speed demon. Its speeds have gone up and down in the years I've been using it, and right now they appear to be on the downswing. If you use locations all around Mullvad's server network, you can expect your download speeds to decrease by about 26 percent and your upload speeds to decline by 17 percent. However, it's important to put those numbers in perspective. First, Mullvad's numbers aren't markedly worse than the ones I got when testing CyberGhost. Its speeds are average, but by definition, most things are average. Its average worldwide latency is actually better than Surfshark, the current champion of download and upload speeds. Speed-testing a Mullvad server in Los Angeles. Sam Chapman for Engadget It's also nice that Mullvad's speed drops follow a predictable curve. Lots of VPNs have unexpectedly sharp declines in certain locations, frequently in Africa. By contrast, Mullvad's speed decreases pretty much as a direct function of how far from the server you are. This not only makes speed drops easier to plan around, but also means you can expect very good speeds on nearby servers. This property of being fastest on servers near the user is another sign of Mullvad's focus on its core privacy mission. If anonymity is your main reason for using a VPN, it doesn't matter what your IP address is, so long as it's not your real one. Using a nearby Mullvad server should guarantee you an internet connection that's both fast and private. Mullvad security test To be secure, a VPN has to check two critical boxes. It must provide you with a secondary IP address without leaking your real one, and it must encrypt your communications with its servers so your activity can't be traced. In the sections below, I'll see whether Mullvad meets those requirements. VPN protocols VPNs use protocols to mediate between end devices, ISPs and their own servers. The first step is to ensure that the service you're considering uses protocols that have expert confidence. Mullvad has kindly made this step easy for me by using only WireGuard on all its apps, with no OpenVPN, IKEv2 or in-house unique protocols. There's no question that WireGuard is a solid protocol. It uses the ChaCha20 stream cipher for symmetric encryption and Poly1305 for authentication, both uncrackable with current technology. Mullvad has even added its own fix for WireGuard's one flaw, its need to save static IP addresses — the Mullvad implementation is set up to delete the IP address if it goes 10 minutes without being used. Even so, it's unfortunate to lose the ability to change protocols, which is one of the most common steps for troubleshooting a VPN connection. I understand Mullvad's reasoning for cutting out OpenVPN (it claims the cryptography isn't strong enough) but don't agree. It's one of this provider's few unforced errors. Leak test There's a straightforward test to determine if your VPN is leaking. Load up any website that shows your IP address — I personally use ipleak.net — and see what IP and location it reveals without your VPN active. Then activate the VPN and refresh the page. If you see your real IP address anywhere, your VPN is leaking. Testing Mullvad for IP leaks. Sam Chapman for Engadget I ran that test on five Mullvad servers. Each time, the website showed me the IP address of the VPN server, concealing my real one. To keep things simple, I ran the initial tests with IPv6 blocked via the Mullvad client. When I turned it on and tried again, the IPv6 traffic didn't leak any more than the IPv4 did. I also saw no signs of WebRTC leaks. Unless you set up a custom DNS server, Mullvad also uses its own DNS, which remains entirely within the VPN tunnel. I had one more leak test to try. Frequently, VPNs are leak-proof when maintaining a connection to one server but drop encryption when switching between servers. That problem is why I ultimately couldn't recommend Norton VPN. Luckily for me, Mullvad has a button that lets you shuffle to another server in the same location, so I used that to see if it stayed leak-proof. Mullvad doesn't leak your IP even while changing servers. Sam Chapman for Engadget As you can see in the screenshot, Mullvad jumped seamlessly from one server to another without showing my real location in-between. On a practical level, that's enough for me to declare Mullvad leak-proof. Encryption test For one final experiment, I used the WireShark packet sniffer to see whether the data Mullvad sent from my computer to my ISP was encrypted. After capturing a few packets, I was gratified to see that they were totally unreadable to interlopers. Most established VPNs pass this test, but it's still important for due diligence. How much does Mullvad cost? Mullvad's pricing structure is one of the most unusual things about it. This is normally the section where I untangle 47 different Pro+ and Business- accounts that are all sold at three different durations. Mullvad couldn't be further from that. It costs 5 Euro a month — that’s it. Each 5-Euro subscription can be used on five devices at once. It manages payments through a system inspired by parking meters. When you sign up for Mullvad, you'll buy as much time as you want. That time will count down until it expires, unless you top it up with more 5-Euro payments. If you run out of money, Mullvad won't charge you a new subscription fee because you didn't tell it not to. It'll just stop working until you pay again. Every payment also comes with a 14-day money-back guarantee, except for payments made in cash. The Mullvad account dashboard. Sam Chapman for Engadget The only real complexity in the process is that Mullvad always figures out its prices in Euro, so outside the EU, the cost per month is affected by exchange rates. If you happen to live in a country where the government's economic policy shuttles between capricious and arbitrary, you might want to grab a few months in advance. The other most interesting thing about Mullvad's pricing is the options you can use to pay. For maximum privacy, you can pay with cash using the payment token you'll find on your account page. Note that this is not the same as your account number. To find it, log into your dashboard on Mullvad.net, click Add time to your account in the left-hand bar, then click the button labeled Cash and scroll down. Make your cash payment by writing the token on an envelope and mailing it to Sweden (full instructions here). Unredacted, in case any hackers out there want to buy me some more time. Sam Chapman for Engadget You can also get untraceable Mullvad vouchers by paying cash at participating retail locations. Most of them are in Europe, but you can order them from Amazon. While your payment to Amazon won't be private, the voucher can't be linked directly to your VPN account, since the actual number is hidden behind a scratch-off panel. It's actually pretty ingenious. Of course, you can also pay using any of the normal methods, including credit cards, cryptocurrency and bank wires (though not PayPal). But the more private methods are always there for people who need them. Mullvad side apps and bundles Mullvad is that rare VPN that's still content to be a VPN and not an all-inclusive security suite. No shade to NordVPN or Surfshark, whose extra features are generally quite good, but it's nice to see at least one of the top providers staying focused. Although Mullvad doesn't have any partners that sell their products alongside its VPN, it does have several partnerships with other VPNs who use its network as the basis for their own products. MalwareBytes Privacy VPN, Mozilla VPN, Tailscale and Obscura can all be considered Mullvad side apps if you squint. Mullvad Browser Mullvad's only product other than the VPN is Mullvad Browser, which is free to download and works on Windows, macOS and Linux. Mullvad Browser works in the background, blocking common methods of browser fingerprinting that can be used to deduce your identity even when you have a VPN running. For example, it automatically reports your time zone as UTC, disguises personal preferences like font and window size, scrambles information sent by APIs and conceals your browser version and computer operating system. It's also in private mode by default, which doesn't hide what your ISP sees but is useful for concealing your activity from other people that might use your computer. Close-reading Mullvad's privacy policy Since privacy is Mullvad's main selling point, this section is even more important than usual. Loopholes in the privacy policy of the privacy VPN would be deeply ironic. Fortunately, Mullvad's privacy policy backs up its high-flying rhetoric. It's a short, pointed and readable document with no problems I could discern. Mullvad has no parent company or subsidiary it might use as a loophole, and no clauses in its policy are left open to interpretation. It's a masterpiece of the privacy-policy genre. The document is actually three policies: a privacy policy, a no-logging policy and a cookie policy. The privacy policy lists all the times Mullvad might collect data about a user. That's exactly two situations — using financial information to process payments (which will be entirely anonymous if you use cash or a voucher) and using your email address to track support tickets you open. That's it. The no-logging policy is a bit longer, but mostly because it's explaining exactly how Mullvad manages to run a VPN service with so little information on individual users. For each account, it stores a number and an expiration date, plus public keys and tunnel addresses if you're using WireGuard (deleted at most 10 minutes after your session ends). Everything else is completely anonymized. Mullvad even claims that its 500,000 or so user accounts could have been created by the same user 500,000 times, which I suppose is one way to spend 2.5 million Euro. The cookie policy is the shortest because Mullvad uses exactly five cookies. One saves your login status in your browser, one saves your language preferences, one protects its site from being used in a specific kind of forgery hack and the other two are for handling Stripe payments. Independent privacy audits Mullvad corroborates its privacy policy with regular audits of various aspects of its service. Currently, there are 17 audits listed on its website, including four infrastructure audits by Cure53. All of its apps have been separately audited and found to be solid. It has been a couple of years since the last full infrastructure audit in 2024, but given how many other targeted reviews Mullvad has gone through since then, it's hard to be too upset about the pause. In 2023, Mullvad achieved the holy grail of VPN privacy: being ordered by subpoena to turn over customer information and not being able to comply because that information didn't exist. Nothing compares to a VPN's privacy being tested in the wild like this. Can Mullvad change your virtual location? Sometimes, a VPN appears to be working, but still reveals your real location to websites. Netflix is a useful proxy for this. To unblock a streaming site like Netflix, a VPN needs to change your virtual location while not appearing to do so — if Netflix sees any hint of VPN traffic, you'll get blocked with the hated proxy error. I used five different locations to check whether Mullvad is up to the streaming task. Server location Unblocked Netflix? Changed content? Vancouver, Canada 3/3 3/3 Gothenberg, Sweden 2/3 2/3 Istanbul, Turkey 3/3 3/3 Johannesburg, South Africa 3/3 3/3 Singapore, Singapore 2/3 2/3 Mullvad did well for streaming, but it didn't manage a perfect score like its fellow anti-establishment VPN Windscribe did. Two of the 15 servers I tested failed to unblock Netflix, one in Singapore and one in Mullvad's hometown of Gothenburg. I also had trouble logging into Netflix while connected to a Vancouver server, though that server did unblock the site consistently once I got inside. Mullvad's servers all tricked Netflix into believing my new location. Sam Chapman for Engadget In Mullvad's defense, no location failed more than once. It's completely possible to get good streaming performance out of this VPN; you just have to be willing to click the server refresh button a few times. Privacy is still the main use case for Mullvad, but it's fine for streaming too. Investigating Mullvad's server network Mullvad has 90 server locations in 50 countries and territories. Unusually for a VPN, users can choose between all 590 of its total servers, including several in each location. There's even a list on its website that shows you the status of every server. Mullvad does not use virtual server locations, so every server is physically located in the place where it claims to be. Here's how they're distributed. Region Countries with servers Total server locations North America 3 25 South America 5 6 Europe 29 41 Africa 2 2 Middle East 2 2 Asia 7 8 Oceania 2 6 Total 50 90 Over half the countries with servers are in Europe and over two-thirds of the cities with servers are in either Europe or North America. That lopsided network is a limitation of Mullvad's refusal to use virtual server locations, since its real servers have to be concentrated in nations developed enough to host data centers. With an all-real network, it's easier to tell which servers will give you the fastest performance, but you can't simulate as much of the world as you can with larger services like ExpressVPN. The good news is that there's at least two real server locations on every continent. Mullvad has a surprisingly robust presence in South America and two bare-metal servers in Africa, which is more than some other VPNs have. In the end, though, the best application of Mullvad is to protect the online privacy of users in North America, Europe and eastern Asia. Extra features of Mullvad Most of Mullvad's features are augmentations to the VPN itself, rather than side options that do other things. Some of them are bread-and-butter, like the kill switch and split tunneling, but a few you won't find anywhere else. Note beforehand that Mullvad does not support port forwarding, so if you depend on that for your torrenting, try another VPN. DAITA AI defenses Mullvad's most novel feature is a recent one. DAITA, which stands for Defense against AI-guided Traffic Analysis, can be toggled on and off in the Mullvad app. According to Mullvad, certain patterns in how browsers communicate with websites can be analyzed by AI to reveal the truth behind encrypted internet history. DAITA hides those packets by filling communications with background noise so the AI won't know what's real. Mullvad's anti-AI settings. Sam Chapman for Engadget DAITA is a laudably forward-looking feature, but as Mullvad itself admits, it will make your browsing speeds slower and drain your battery. I recommend only using it for activities you really want to hide. Quantum resistance Mullvad's desktop apps establish quantum-proof WireGuard tunnels by default. Quantum computing isn't yet a threat to WireGuard, but it may become dangerous in the future, so Mullvad is getting ahead of the problem (along with a few other services like NordVPN). When quantum resistance is active, Mullvad encapsulates its keys using the current standard mechanism, ML-KEM. Anti-censorship If you find yourself in a country where government censorship makes it hard to access the internet, Mullvad has options that might help. These anti-censorship features can be used to get around firewalls that block visible VPN traffic. You have several options, including changing your WireGuard port, randomizing your port number, disguising your VPN traffic as an ordinary HTTPS connection or using an obfuscated Shadowsocks proxy. Mullvad's anti-censorship involves more features than most VPNs have in this area. This makes it a bit less user-friendly, but a lot more likely to work. If you're new to getting around censorship, Mullvad's help center has a helpful page about using its anti-censor settings. Multihop Many VPNs offer a double-hop connection that routes your traffic through two servers instead of one, adding a redundant layer of encryption in case one server malfunctions. Mullvad pulls ahead of the competition (except Surfshark, which also does this) by allowing you to choose your entry and exit servers. When you activate the multihop option and open the server list, you'll be prompted to pick two locations instead of one. Mullvad's server list with multihop enabled. Sam Chapman for Engadget This means you can select an entry server that's close to you and an exit server in any country whose location you want to spoof, letting you fine-tune your own performance. It's way nicer than being railroaded into certain paths. DNS content blockers Mullvad includes six blocklists that can keep you or your family members from looking at unwanted content: ads, trackers, malware, gambling, adult content and social media. These lists can't be customized like Windscribe's R.O.B.E.R.T. blocks can, so you're limited to just turning them on and off. IPv6 support The internet is gradually transitioning from the old IPv4 standard over to IPv6, which will allow many more addresses to be shared out. Mullvad is one of a few VPNs looking ahead to the IPv6 era. You can leave it to block all IPv6 traffic, but if you do need IPv6 for any reason, you can enable it while still being connected to a Mullvad server. Kill switch and lockdown mode Mullvad comes with two features that protect against unexpectedly losing your VPN defenses. The first is a kill switch, a common VPN option that cuts off internet access if the VPN tunnel ever fails. This simple measure helps guard against accidental leaks. Lockdown mode is the stronger option. While it's active, you will be unable to get on the internet unless you connect to a Mullvad server first. This will remain true if you turn the connection off yourself and even if you quit the app. Split tunneling Split tunneling is available on Mullvad's apps for every system except iOS. It lets you send some apps outside the VPN tunnel so they get online with your normal IP address. It's helpful if you have some apps that don't work with the VPN active — this is common with online banking, as an example. Another common application is to protect a torrenting client in the background while using your browser unprotected for better speeds. Mullvad customer support options Mullvad makes two forms of support available in the app. You can report a problem by going to Settings -> Support -> Report a problem, typing your question (requested to be in either English or Swedish, though they'd probably be able to read a question run through Google Translate) and optionally providing your email. You can also view the app's logs at any time, which can be useful to help a technician diagnose your problem. If you'd rather search for a solution at your own pace, you can go to that same page and click FAQs and Guides instead. This opens the help center in a browser. Mullvad's help center, including the dropdown filter menus. Sam Chapman for Engadget I love Mullvad's approach to laying out its FAQs. Instead of crowding topics into five or six categories and making you guess whether your problem falls under setup, usage or troubleshooting, Mullvad gives you a set of dropdown filters to narrow down the articles which might relate to your problem. By the time you've named which device, OS and protocol you're dealing with, you won’t have many articles left to sift through. There is an annoying tendency for certain sets of filters to reduce the number of surfaced links to zero, but for those cases, there's a search bar that also works well. The articles themselves are good enough that I referred to them several times while writing this review. Some of them are a bit overlong, but they're diligent about including both internal and external links to get you where you're going fast. Live support experience This is normally where I cover how it feels to get live chat support from the VPN I'm reviewing. However, Mullvad doesn't have live chat support. That's unfortunate, although it's still better than Windscribe's approach of forcing you to banter with a sarcastic robot. Instead, I sent a question via email to Mullvad's support team, and got a response within 24 hours. Mullvad background check Mullvad was founded in 2009 in Sweden. It's still owned and operated by its original founders. According to a detailed timeline on its website, its 16-year history has been as uneventful as any user could ask for, with not much changing except updates to stay on the technological leading edge. The only controversy mentioned in Mullvad's own materials is the 2023 police raid of its headquarters, which (as I covered in the privacy section) only makes them look better. So as not to take Mullvad at its word, I scoured the last 16 years of news items and user reports to search for any other blemishes on its record. Based on that research, I found no reason to doubt Mullvad's honesty about its location, owners or team. I found just one leak that wasn't noted on Mullvad's own site. In 2023, a security research group called ZATAZ alleged that it found anonymized information on Mullvad users saved on an Internet Archive page, including account numbers (linked article is in French). According to ZATAZ, Mullvad contacted the Archive and got the page deleted. To my mind, the only mistake Mullvad made in response to the ZATAZ allegations was not making a public statement about the incident. I can see why they didn't think it was a big deal, since even logging into someone else's Mullvad account wouldn't show you their browsing history, but it's always better to communicate about these things. Final verdict Mullvad is a VPN that knows what it wants to be and achieves that goal with flying colors. It's not trying to be an everything app — it does privacy and does it well. That's not to say it has nothing going on outside the VPN itself, as its DNS blockers, AI defenses and split tunneling all work smoothly. But if you want a VPN that's not ashamed to be a VPN, Mullvad is the right choice. Of course, it has its own compromises. It's solidly in the middle of the speed pack and occasionally trips up when unblocking streaming sites. The lack of any protocols other than WireGuard grates on me a bit, since it reduces the user's options for troubleshooting. With all that said, those are minor hiccups on a VPN that does such a thorough job keeping you anonymous online.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/mullvad-vpn-review-near-total-privacy-with-a-few-sacrifices-130000056.html?src=rss",

          "title": "The best smart plugs in 2026",
          "standfirst": "Smart plugs aren’t the most complicated smart home device — they really just turn stuff off and on — but they do make life a little easier. Since using smart plugs, I’ve grown accustomed to having the living room lamps click on just before sunset and go off when I say goodnight to Alexa or the Google Assistant/Gemini (Siri can turn off a few of my lights, but isn’t compatible with all of them). Most smart home device makers have a plug or two in their lineups, but finding one that’s compatible with your chosen ecosystem, that’s easy to set up and reliably connects can involve a little trial and error. That’s why we tried more than a dozen models to find the best smart plugs you can buy right now.. Best smart plugs for 2026 The best outdoor smart plugs for 2026 Most people will likely use outdoor plugs for two things: patio lighting and holiday string lights. The devices are designed for the outdoors with a weatherproof protection rating of IP64 or higher, which means they’re impervious to dust and can handle splashing water from rain and sprinklers. They have a longer Wi-Fi range than indoor plugs, for obvious reasons, and many have dual outlets, with individual control over each one. Setup is the same as for indoor plugs: you’ll use your phone to help the plug find your Wi-Fi using its companion app. The only tricky part is getting your phone within Bluetooth range of the plug (which it uses to initialize setup) and in Wi-Fi range at the same time. I had to awkwardly stand at a triangulated point in the middle of my driveway to get things communicating properly. Once set up, the plugs will communicate using your router for voice and app control and your phone needn’t be anywhere near the plug. Best uses for a smart plug Before you buy one, it helps to know how a smart plug works best. They are designed for things that have an on/off switch, making them great for doing things like turning regular ol’ lamps into smart lights. If you want a fan to move some air around before you get home, a smart plug can help. You can load a basic coffee maker with grounds and water the night before and wake up to a fresh pot in the morning. And instead of an air purifier running all day, you could set it to just run when you’re away. But gadgets that need to be programmed further, or require a stand-by mode, aren't ideal. If you want to control built-in lights, you’ll need a smart light switch, which are more involved than smart plugs as they can involve in-wall installation. Smart bulbs are also an option for automation, and we have an entire guide devoted to those. Some smart plugs can even monitor how much energy they use and display those figures within their companion app. That might not be much use on its own, as lamps with LED light bulbs consume very little energy, but it could help you keep tabs on your overall energy consumption. What to consider when buying a smart plug Setup and use Adding a smart plug to your home is relatively simple. You’ll use the manufacturer’s app to initially connect, after which you can add the plug to a compatible smart home ecosystem so you can use voice control and other features. Both the brand’s app and your smart home app will let you name the plug, set schedules and program “routines” which provide automation for multiple smart devices at once. But as you can guess, a manufacturer’s app only lets you control products from that brand. If you want whole-home automation, operating, say, a plug from TP-Link’s Kasa, a smart bulb from Philips Hue, a smart thermostat from Honeywell and a camera from Arlo without switching apps, you’ll need to use a smart home platform, which means you’ll need to consider compatibility. Compatibility Smart home devices connect through wireless protocols, often using more than one to communicate with your phone, smart speaker, router and in some cases, one another. The majority of smart plugs use Wi-Fi, but some have recently incorporated Matter, a relatively new wireless standard intended to solve integration issues between different brands and manufacturers, while also improving security and reliability. More of these smart plugs are coming to market and, for now, most Matter devices work via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and a low-power mesh network called Thread. Matter requires a controller that stays at home, like a hub or smart speaker, to manage things when you’re out and about. As for Bluetooth, most plugs, including all Matter plugs, use the short-range protocol to get the device set up for the first time. Some can continue to run on Bluetooth in the absence of another option, but the connection isn’t as reliable and you won’t be able to control the plug when you’re away from home, or perhaps even just on the other side of the apartment. Because Matter is relatively new, it may be easier to consider the manufacturer’s system you’d use the most. There are four major “branded” smart home platforms: Amazon’s Alexa, Google Home, Apple’s HomeKit and Samsung’s SmartThings. The first two work with the widest range of brands and are compatible with both iOS and Android devices. HomeKit not only limits app access to Apple devices, but it’s also compatible with fewer plugs. You can also turn to open-source software like Home Assistant or go with the larger functionality of IFTTT if you want to, say, have your lights turn off when your Uber arrives. For the purposes of our testing, we stuck with the four big players. Nearly every plug we looked at clearly stated which platforms it works with, both on the packaging and retail product pages. Of course, there’s no rule that says you have to stick with one home assistant. You might have an Echo Dot in the basement, a HomePod in the living room and a Google Nest Mini in the kitchen, each controlling any compatible devices. My kid has a great time telling Alexa to turn on a light then asking Google's Gemini to turn it back off. Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget Hubs and smart plugs All of our top picks recommended here don’t require a hub and connect directly to your home’s Wi-Fi router. That means if you already have wireless internet and a smartphone or tablet, you can quite literally plug and play. The exception is Apple’s HomeKit. If you want to pair up a compatible plug with that platform, you’ll need a HomePod speaker, Apple TV or an iPad that stays in your home to enable remote control when you’re away. Some smart plugs require a hub regardless of which platform you use. For our guide, we focused on the simplicity (and lower cost) of options that work on their own, but hub-dependent devices may make sense in certain situations. Some companies, like Aqara and Lutron for example, make a vast range of smart home products, adding automatic shades, window sensors, smart locks and air quality monitors to the more traditional cameras and plugs. If you’re going all-in on one brand and plan to get a plethora of connected devices, a hub can keep your Wi-Fi network from getting too crowded and provide a more seamless setup with reliable connectivity. Zigbee devices use their own protocol (different from Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) and also requires a hub. Sharing Once a plug is set up with your platform and voice assistant of choice, anyone can control the plug just by talking. If someone else wants to control things with their phone, things get more complicated. Google makes it easiest, allowing you to invite another person just by tapping the + button within the Home app. Whomever you invite will have full access to your connected devices – including cameras – so this is only for people you trust the most. HomeKit makes it similarly easy to grant app access to someone else, but as with most things Apple, it only works for other iOS users. Amazon only allows you to share access to your Echo, not your connected home devices. Many smart plug manufacturers allow you to share control through their app by inviting another person via email. But this only grants access to devices of that brand. Hopefully as Matter expands, multi-admin features will become more widespread. If you get a new Wi-Fi network Most people will wirelessly connect their smart plugs to their home’s Wi-Fi router. Matter, Z-Wave, Thread and other smart home protocols can work over local networks, but for most setups, the signals telling your plugs what to do will be dispatched through your router. If you happen to get a new one (like I did when it became clear my very basic gateway could not handle the number of smart home devices being tested) you’ll need to take a few steps to get everything reconnected. Depending on the brand, the steps may simply involve using the plug’s companion app to update your credentials (network name and password). Or it will require deleting the device in the companion app, doing a factory reset (typically by pressing the onboard button for 10 seconds) and setting up the plug like it's brand new. GE Sync and Emporia plugs allow for a credentials update via their apps, others, like TP-Link Kasa and Meross plugs require deletion and a factory reset to get along with your new network. Amazon’s smart plug updates automatically after updating the associated Echo device. How we tested the best smart plugs Before I decided which smart plugs to test, we considered brands Engadget staffers have had the best experiences with, both in review capacity and personally. We also checked out other online reviews. I then looked at factors like price, compatibility and relative popularity. Then, I tested about a dozen plugs using their companion apps and the four major smart home ecosystems. With lamps, lights, heaters, fans and more plugged into them, I set schedules, create routines, use voice control and generally live with the devices to evaluate them. I and continue to test good candidates as new models hit the market. Other smart plugs we tested Eve Energy Strip The Eve Energy Strip only works with HomeKit and it’s a bit more expensive than our pick for a smart strip. But it’s an exceedingly attractive device complete with an aluminum frame and easy-to-read LED buttons. Those act as both indicators and manual switches for each of the three, individually controlled and nicely spaced plugs. Setup happens through the HomeKit app but after that, you can control the plug (and curiously, many other smart home devices active in your HomeKit profile) through the Eve Energy app. Here, you’ll be able to create schedules and automations as well as monitor the plug’s energy usage. Meross Matter plug (MSS115) I wasn’t able to test the Meross Matter plug fully. It requires Wi-Fi splitting, a process that’s certainly possible for the average consumer, but more involved than it should be, considering the more than dozen other plugs I’ve tested don’t require such a step. The plug itself also blocked the other outlet. Meross has an updated version of the Matter device on the way, one that looks to solve both issues and we’ll update this guide accordingly once we’ve had a chance to test it. Roku Smart Plug Roku’s smart home gear is basically Wyze equipment with an app and packaging that are more purple. The Roku smart plug performed just fine with both compatible voice assistants (Alexa and Gemini). The companion app doesn’t offer scheduling that revolves around the timing of the sunset in your area, but the plugs go for less than $10 each and if you’ve got a Roku TV or streaming device set up and want to keep everything on-brand, it could be a fit. Aquara Smart Plug The Aqara plug requires an Aqara hub. In tests, the connectivity was solid and the companion app allowed for useful if/then automations that can rope in other Aqara devices like locks, window shades, cameras and more. The plug also worked well with voice assistants from Amazon, Google and Apple. As a stand-alone plug, however, it’s tough to recommend the nearly $100 combo to anyone who isn’t planning to get a complete Aqara smart home setup. Smart plug FAQs What are the disadvantages of a smart plug? While they’re great when everything is working properly, smart plugs can be frustrating, adding a layer of complication to the simple act of turning on a light, if something goes wrong. For example: If your Wi-Fi goes out, your smart plug won’t work. If the smart plug loses its connection to your router, it won’t work. If you change your Wi-Fi password or provider, you’ll have to re-program your smart plugs. If you forget what you named a particular plug during setup, you may be faced with an irritating conversation with your voice assistant. The best way to avoid some of those problems is to get a plug that works reliably, which is one of the features we considered for this guide. How much power does a smart plug draw? Smart plugs don’t draw much more power than whatever you’re plugging into them. True, they remain on standby to await instructions from your smart assistant or other controller, so they’re always using a small amount of power. But if, for example, you set a light to automatically turn off at night, and that light would otherwise stay on unnecessarily, the smart plug will save far more energy than the watt or two extra that it draws. Do smart plugs use Bluetooth? Some smart plugs use Bluetooth to connect to your phone during setup. After that, most connect to your home’s Wi-Fi network. What appliances should not be plugged into a smart plug? Common sense will help you determine what not to plug in. Obviously anything dangerous like power tools should not be plugged into a smart plug. Appliances that require supervision, such as space heaters and curling irons, shouldn’t be set to turn on automatically if no one will be around. You also shouldn’t bother with anything that needs further programming. Simple on/off appliances like lamps and fans work best.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-smart-plug-131542429.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Smart plugs aren’t the most complicated smart home device — they really just turn stuff off and on — but they do make life a little easier. Since using smart plugs, I’ve grown accustomed to having the living room lamps click on just before sunset and go off when I say goodnight to Alexa or the Google Assistant/Gemini (Siri can turn off a few of my lights, but isn’t compatible with all of them). Most smart home device makers have a plug or two in their lineups, but finding one that’s compatible with your chosen ecosystem, that’s easy to set up and reliably connects can involve a little trial and error. That’s why we tried more than a dozen models to find the best smart plugs you can buy right now.. Best smart plugs for 2026 The best outdoor smart plugs for 2026 Most people will likely use outdoor plugs for two things: patio lighting and holiday string lights. The devices are designed for the outdoors with a weatherproof protection rating of IP64 or higher, which means they’re impervious to dust and can handle splashing water from rain and sprinklers. They have a longer Wi-Fi range than indoor plugs, for obvious reasons, and many have dual outlets, with individual control over each one. Setup is the same as for indoor plugs: you’ll use your phone to help the plug find your Wi-Fi using its companion app. The only tricky part is getting your phone within Bluetooth range of the plug (which it uses to initialize setup) and in Wi-Fi range at the same time. I had to awkwardly stand at a triangulated point in the middle of my driveway to get things communicating properly. Once set up, the plugs will communicate using your router for voice and app control and your phone needn’t be anywhere near the plug. Best uses for a smart plug Before you buy one, it helps to know how a smart plug works best. They are designed for things that have an on/off switch, making them great for doing things like turning regular ol’ lamps into smart lights. If you want a fan to move some air around before you get home, a smart plug can help. You can load a basic coffee maker with grounds and water the night before and wake up to a fresh pot in the morning. And instead of an air purifier running all day, you could set it to just run when you’re away. But gadgets that need to be programmed further, or require a stand-by mode, aren't ideal. If you want to control built-in lights, you’ll need a smart light switch, which are more involved than smart plugs as they can involve in-wall installation. Smart bulbs are also an option for automation, and we have an entire guide devoted to those. Some smart plugs can even monitor how much energy they use and display those figures within their companion app. That might not be much use on its own, as lamps with LED light bulbs consume very little energy, but it could help you keep tabs on your overall energy consumption. What to consider when buying a smart plug Setup and use Adding a smart plug to your home is relatively simple. You’ll use the manufacturer’s app to initially connect, after which you can add the plug to a compatible smart home ecosystem so you can use voice control and other features. Both the brand’s app and your smart home app will let you name the plug, set schedules and program “routines” which provide automation for multiple smart devices at once. But as you can guess, a manufacturer’s app only lets you control products from that brand. If you want whole-home automation, operating, say, a plug from TP-Link’s Kasa, a smart bulb from Philips Hue, a smart thermostat from Honeywell and a camera from Arlo without switching apps, you’ll need to use a smart home platform, which means you’ll need to consider compatibility. Compatibility Smart home devices connect through wireless protocols, often using more than one to communicate with your phone, smart speaker, router and in some cases, one another. The majority of smart plugs use Wi-Fi, but some have recently incorporated Matter, a relatively new wireless standard intended to solve integration issues between different brands and manufacturers, while also improving security and reliability. More of these smart plugs are coming to market and, for now, most Matter devices work via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and a low-power mesh network called Thread. Matter requires a controller that stays at home, like a hub or smart speaker, to manage things when you’re out and about. As for Bluetooth, most plugs, including all Matter plugs, use the short-range protocol to get the device set up for the first time. Some can continue to run on Bluetooth in the absence of another option, but the connection isn’t as reliable and you won’t be able to control the plug when you’re away from home, or perhaps even just on the other side of the apartment. Because Matter is relatively new, it may be easier to consider the manufacturer’s system you’d use the most. There are four major “branded” smart home platforms: Amazon’s Alexa, Google Home, Apple’s HomeKit and Samsung’s SmartThings. The first two work with the widest range of brands and are compatible with both iOS and Android devices. HomeKit not only limits app access to Apple devices, but it’s also compatible with fewer plugs. You can also turn to open-source software like Home Assistant or go with the larger functionality of IFTTT if you want to, say, have your lights turn off when your Uber arrives. For the purposes of our testing, we stuck with the four big players. Nearly every plug we looked at clearly stated which platforms it works with, both on the packaging and retail product pages. Of course, there’s no rule that says you have to stick with one home assistant. You might have an Echo Dot in the basement, a HomePod in the living room and a Google Nest Mini in the kitchen, each controlling any compatible devices. My kid has a great time telling Alexa to turn on a light then asking Google's Gemini to turn it back off. Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget Hubs and smart plugs All of our top picks recommended here don’t require a hub and connect directly to your home’s Wi-Fi router. That means if you already have wireless internet and a smartphone or tablet, you can quite literally plug and play. The exception is Apple’s HomeKit. If you want to pair up a compatible plug with that platform, you’ll need a HomePod speaker, Apple TV or an iPad that stays in your home to enable remote control when you’re away. Some smart plugs require a hub regardless of which platform you use. For our guide, we focused on the simplicity (and lower cost) of options that work on their own, but hub-dependent devices may make sense in certain situations. Some companies, like Aqara and Lutron for example, make a vast range of smart home products, adding automatic shades, window sensors, smart locks and air quality monitors to the more traditional cameras and plugs. If you’re going all-in on one brand and plan to get a plethora of connected devices, a hub can keep your Wi-Fi network from getting too crowded and provide a more seamless setup with reliable connectivity. Zigbee devices use their own protocol (different from Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) and also requires a hub. Sharing Once a plug is set up with your platform and voice assistant of choice, anyone can control the plug just by talking. If someone else wants to control things with their phone, things get more complicated. Google makes it easiest, allowing you to invite another person just by tapping the + button within the Home app. Whomever you invite will have full access to your connected devices – including cameras – so this is only for people you trust the most. HomeKit makes it similarly easy to grant app access to someone else, but as with most things Apple, it only works for other iOS users. Amazon only allows you to share access to your Echo, not your connected home devices. Many smart plug manufacturers allow you to share control through their app by inviting another person via email. But this only grants access to devices of that brand. Hopefully as Matter expands, multi-admin features will become more widespread. If you get a new Wi-Fi network Most people will wirelessly connect their smart plugs to their home’s Wi-Fi router. Matter, Z-Wave, Thread and other smart home protocols can work over local networks, but for most setups, the signals telling your plugs what to do will be dispatched through your router. If you happen to get a new one (like I did when it became clear my very basic gateway could not handle the number of smart home devices being tested) you’ll need to take a few steps to get everything reconnected.

          "standfirst": "Presented by Cisco AI agents are breaking traditional IT operations models, adding complexity, data silos, and fragmented workflows. DJ Sampath, Cisco&#x27;s SVP of AI Software and Platform, believes that AgenticOps is the solution: a new operational paradigm where humans and AI collaborate in real time to create efficiency, boost security, and allow for innovative technological applications.In a recent conversation with VentureBeat, Sampath outlined why current enterprise IT management is fundamentally breaking and what makes AgenticOps not just useful, but necessary for IT operations going forward.The breaking point of traditional IT operationsThe core problem plaguing enterprise IT today is fragmentation, Sampath said.\"A lot of times inside of these enterprises, data is sitting across multiple different silos,\" he explained. \"For an operator to come in and start troubleshooting something, they have to go through many different dashboards, many different products, and that results in an increasing amount of time spent trying to figure out what is where before they can actually get to the root cause of an issue.\"This challenge is about to intensify dramatically. As AI agents become ubiquitous within enterprises, the complexity will multiply exponentially. \"Every single person is going to have at least 10 or more agents that are working on their behalf doing different types of things,\" Sampath said. \"This problem is only going to be tenfold, if not a hundredfold worse when you start to think about what&#x27;s really happening with the inclusion of agents.\"Three core principles of AgenticOpsTo address these challenges, Cisco has developed its AgenticOps capabilities around three fundamental design principles that Sampath believes must be true for this new operational model to succeed.First, unified data access across silos. The platform must bring together disparate data sources: network data, security data, application data, and infrastructure data. \"Bringing all of that stuff together is going to be incredibly important so that the agents that you are deploying to do work on your behalf can seamlessly connect the dots across the board,\" Sampath said.Second, multiplayer-first design. AgenticOps must be fundamentally collaborative from the ground up, enabling IT operations, security operations, network operations teams — and agents — to work together seamlessly. \"When you bring the IT ops person, the SecOps person, the NetOps person all together, you can troubleshoot and debug issues a whole lot faster than if you&#x27;re working in silos and copy pasting things back and forth,\" he explained. \"It&#x27;s humans and agents working together in a synchronous environment.\"Third, purpose-built AI models. While general-purpose AI models excel at broad tasks, specialized operations require models trained for specific domains. \"When you start to go into specializations, it becomes really important for these models to understand very specific things like network configuration or thread models that you care about and needs to be able to reason about that,\" he said.How Cisco operationalizes AgenticOps across the enterprise stackCisco&#x27;s approach unites telemetry, intelligence, and collaboration into a single coherent platform. Cisco AI Canvas is an operations workspace that replaces multiple dashboards with a generative UI and a unified collaborative experience. Within AI Canvas, operators can use natural language to delegate actions to agents — pulling telemetry, correlating signals, testing hypotheses, and executing changes — while maintaining human-in-the-loop control.The reasoning capabilities come from Cisco&#x27;s Deep Network Model, trained on over 40 years of operational data including CCIE expertise, production telemetry, Cisco’s Technical Assistance Center (TAC), and Customer Experience (CX) insights. This purpose-built model delivers domain-specific intelligence that general-purpose models cannot match.Cisco&#x27;s platform spans campus, branch, cloud, and edge environments, allowing agents to consume telemetry across the entire ecosystem at machine speed, including Meraki, ThousandEyes, and Splunk. With MCP servers implemented across Cisco products, agents gain standardized access to tools and data without custom integration work.How fragmented reporting data undermines IT troubleshootingThe traditional approach to IT troubleshooting involves raising tickets and piecing together fragmenting information across multiple systems. \"People take screenshots. Sometimes it&#x27;s in Post-it notes,\" Sampath said. \"All of this information stays in completely different channels so it becomes really hard for somebody to start collecting them together.\"Cisco AI Canvas addresses this by giving teams one shared, real-time workspace for the work at hand — so context doesn&#x27;t get scattered across chats, tickets and screen shares. Teams can collaborate live, escalate instantly, and contribute context (such as screenshots and notes) alongside the agent&#x27;s generated charts and graphs. But the real power emerges when AI agents join these collaborative sessions. \"The machines are constantly learning from these human to machine interactions,\" Sampath explained. \"When you see that same problem happen again, you are that much faster in responding because the machines can assist you.\"This creates a virtuous cycle of continuous improvement, where the agent asks if you&#x27;d like to continue using the same approach as last time, for example, and you&#x27;re able to hand over more work to the agent. And the time spent debugging gets compressed as the system learns and accelerates future responses.Security as an AI acceleratorHistorically security has been considered a roadblock to adoption and even innovation. But with the right guardrails, organizations can confidently deploy AI at scale, and even accelerate it. Employees have already experienced the productivity gains of tools like ChatGPT and want similar capabilities within their enterprise environments. When organizations can detect personally identifiable information, prevent prompt injection attacks, and maintain proper data governance, they can unlock and unleash the AI adoption inside of the enterprise in a fundamentally different fashion.The identity layer required for cross-domain AgenticOpsCross-domain data access presents one of the most complex challenges in AgenticOps implementation. Cisco&#x27;s strategic acquisitions, particularly Splunk, position the company to address this, unifying data across traditionally disconnected systems. But bringing data together is only half the battle, since who has access to what data becomes vitally important.Cisco is evolving its Duo platform beyond multi-factor authentication to serve as a comprehensive identity provider, with robust identity and access management baked into the platform from the beginning, not bolted on as an afterthought. \"We&#x27;re investing in identity as a very core pillar of how these agents are going to be able to pull data from different data sources with the right authorization in mind,” explains Sampath. “Should this agent have access to this type of data? Should you be correlating these types of data together to be able to solve a problem?\" Humans in the loop, but at a higher levelAs AI agents become more autonomous, the role of humans will evolve rather than disappear. \"We&#x27;re always going to have humans in the loop,\" Sampath said. \"What you&#x27;re going to see is the complexity of the tasks that are being performed are going to be a lot more involved.\"Take coding as an example, which today can be entirely agentic. The human role has shifted from manual coding, or even tab completion, to asking an agent to create code wholesale, and then verifying that it meets requirements before merging it into the codebase. This pattern will repeat across IT operations, with humans focusing on higher-level decision-making while agents handle execution. Importantly, rollback capabilities ensure that even autonomous actions can be reversed if needed.Why waiting for AI to &#x27;settle down&#x27; is the wrong moveFor CIOs and CTOs, the message is clear: don&#x27;t wait. \"A lot of folks are in this holding pattern of waiting and watching,\" Sampath said. \"They&#x27;re waiting for AI to settle down before they make some of their decisions. And I think that is the wrong way to think about this. A partnership with the right groups of people, with the right sets of vendors, is going to help you go a whole lot faster, as opposed to trying to just stay on the fence, trying to figure out what&#x27;s right and what&#x27;s wrong.\"Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

This pattern will repeat across IT operations, with humans focusing on higher-level decision-making while agents handle execution. Importantly, rollback capabilities ensure that even autonomous actions can be reversed if needed.Why waiting for AI to &#x27;settle down&#x27; is the wrong moveFor CIOs and CTOs, the message is clear: don&#x27;t wait. \"A lot of folks are in this holding pattern of waiting and watching,\" Sampath said. \"They&#x27;re waiting for AI to settle down before they make some of their decisions. And I think that is the wrong way to think about this. A partnership with the right groups of people, with the right sets of vendors, is going to help you go a whole lot faster, as opposed to trying to just stay on the fence, trying to figure out what&#x27;s right and what&#x27;s wrong.\"Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

          "standfirst": "Samsung’s 2025 was filled with new foldables, an ultra-thin new form factor and the launch of Google's XR platform. After making some announcements at CES 2026, the company has just announced its first Galaxy Unpacked of the year will take place on February 25, where it is expected to introduce the Galaxy S26 lineup. Official invites have just been shared, but actual information on what devices are arriving then is still unknown. But as usual, we know a lot about what’s expected at Unpacked.Engadget will be covering Galaxy Unpacked live, and we'll most likely have hands-on coverage of Samsung's new smartphones soon after they're announced. While we wait for the full details, here's everything we expect Samsung will introduce at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026.When is Unpacked 2026 taking place?According to the official invite that Samsung shared on February 10, Unpacked will happen on February 25, 2026 in San Francisco. The keynote will start at 10AM PT (1PM ET) and be livestreamed on Samsung.com, as well as the company’s newsroom and YouTube channel. The announcement on February 10 also said this launch will mark “a new phase in the era of AI as intelligence becomes truly personal and adaptive.” It’s not a lot to go on, since we’ve heard a version of this from various companies over the last few years, but at least we won’t be shocked when we hear more about AI in just about two weeks.Galaxy S26, S26+ and S26 UltraSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on photoPhoto by Sam Rutherford/EngadgetSamsung's restrained approach to updating its phones will likely continue with the Galaxy S26. Based on leaked images of the new lineup, the company is not expected to radically reinvent the look of the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ or Galaxy S26 Ultra, and instead will stick with a similar design to what it used on the Galaxy S25. The phones will have a flat front screen and frame, with rounded corners and cameras housed in a vertical pill-shaped plateau on the back. Unlike Apple's move from the iPhone 16 Pro to the iPhone 17 Pro, the biggest difference here will likely be internal components like the screens, chips and camera sensors Samsung uses.Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip is expected to be in all Samsung Galaxy S26 phones, though Korean news site Yonhap News reports Samsung's relatively new Exynos 2600 chip could be used in some phones in the lineup depending on the region, a strategy Samsung has deployed in the past. Either way the new phones should be more performant than the previous generation, and in the case of the models with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, particularly good at on-device AI processing.I have compiled the most accurate comprehensive parameter comparison of Galaxy S25, S25+ and Galaxy S26、 S26+. Which one do you want to buy? pic.twitter.com/aQpoSvYjOz— Ice Universe (@UniverseIce) November 29, 2025One notable difference between the Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S25 could be the phone's screen. The new phone will reportedly feature a 6.3-inch FHD+ display according to specs shared by leaker Ice Universe, which makes it ever so slightly larger than the 6.2-inch display used on the Galaxy S25. The S26 will also allegedly come with 12GB of RAM, either 256GB or 512GB of storage and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery. Samsung isn't changing the cameras on the entry-level phone, though: leaks suggest it'll feature the same 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie camera as the previous generation. Changes appear to be even more minor on the Galaxy S26+. Other than the new Snapdragon chip, the phone will reportedly feature the same 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 4,900mAh battery, 12GB of RAM and the same camera array used on the base Galaxy S26.The difference between the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra is reportedly a bit clearer. According to Android Headlines, the new phone's cameras will be slightly more raised, and stand out thanks to a new metallic finish. Samsung may also switch back to using an aluminum frame on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, after using titanium frames on both the Galaxy S24 and S25 Ultras. Most importantly, to make the phone actually support Qi2 rather than only technically work with the standard when a case is attached, rumors suggest Samsung will remove the S Pen digitizer layer in the phone and adopt a new method for accepting stylus input. It's not clear what that new method will actually be, but it could let the Galaxy S26 Ultra more easily work with Qi2 accessories without losing its stylus.Android Headlines also recently shared what appear to be full image renders of the S26 series, and they generally line up with what has already been rumored, leaked and reported so far. If these pictures are accurate, they give us a clearer look at the camera bump and two color variants of the S26 Ultra.Fans of magnets may continue to be disappointed by Samsung if the latest rumors are accurate. Despite the launch of the Qi 2 wireless charging standard adding support for convenient magnetic alignment years ago, Samsung has yet to bring that feature to its phones. Though the S-series have the higher speed charging rates that the spec enables, Nieuwemobiel.nl is reporting that, due to images it received of cases with magnetic rings, the S26 series likely won’t have built-in magnets. Samsung has made these cases to add the magnetic capability to its S-series in the past, and the existence of the images of these accessories lends weight to the idea that the company will continue this approach.Galaxy Buds 4Galaxy Buds 3 Pro in case.EngadgetSamsung released the Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro in 2024, with a major redesign that brought them much more in line with Apple's AirPods. The Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro Samsung is rumored to be announcing soon won't necessarily change that, though they will feature a more compact case and less angular stems, according to leaked images from the Samsung Tips app.Support for head gestures to accept and decline calls, a feature Apple includes on the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4, is also rumored to work on both versions of the new Galaxy Buds. SamMobile reports the Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro may also ship with a new Ultra Wideband chip that will make them easier to find with Google's Find Hub network.Galaxy Z TrifoldYes, the TriFold has a crease, two in fact. But they still don't ruin the experience. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetSamsung announced the Galaxy Z TriFold in late 2025 without firm details of when the new smartphone-that-folds-into-a-tablet would be available in North America. That info came on January 27, when the company announced the TriFold would be available in the US on January 30, for a whopping $2,900. Considering we’ve already seen the device in person at CES 2026 and people are most likely to have had a chance to look at, if not buy the foldable for themselves by the time Unpacked rolls around, we don’t expect Samsung to spend too much time dwelling on it, if at all.Galaxy S26 EdgeAt just 5.8mm thick, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is one of the thinnest smartphones ever made. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetWhen the Galaxy S25 Edge was announced in 2025, it seemed possible that Samsung could replace its \"Plus\" smartphone with a unique form factor, just like Apple has opted to do with the iPhone Air. There have been conflicting reports on the matter, but it seems like Samsung will not be doing that with the Galaxy S26 Edge.Instead, the smartphone will reportedly remain another option, much like foldables are for customers not swayed by Samsung's traditional smartphones. The Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to feature a slightly different design than last year's model, according to Android Headlines, with a large rectangular camera plateau that's reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones, and the raised oval Apple used on the iPhone Air. Beyond that, the phone is also expected to be ever so slightly thinner at 5.5mm than the 5.8mm Galaxy S25 Edge.Bixby and other AI featuresSamsung already acts as a first place Google can show off new AI features for Android, but the company is reportedly exploring other AI partnerships, too. In June 2025, Bloomberg reported that Samsung was nearing a deal with Perplexity to integrate its AI-powered search engine across OneUI and its homegrown mobile browser. Perplexity already has a deal with Motorola on its Razr phones, so the only thing that would make a deal with Samsung unusual is the close relationship the company already has with Google.The company also accidentally announced a new version of its Bixby AI assistant, which will likely also be integrated with Perplexity and could serve as an alternative to Google Gemini. Both a new Bixby and a deeper integration with Perplexity seem like natural new software features to show off at Galaxy Unpacked.Update, January 27 2026, 11:55AM ET: This story has been updated to reflect the latest news around the Galaxy Z TriFold’s price and availability in the US.Update, January 30 2026, 12:45PM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks on the possible dates for Unpacked 2026.Update, February 02 2026, 11:30AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks with full image renders of the S26 trio of devices.Update, February 03 2026, 11:00AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks about the possible lack of magnetic support on the S26 series.Update, February 10 2026, 7:15PM ET: This story has been updated to include the official date of Galaxy Unpacked as Samsung announced it today.

          "title": "OpenAI upgrades its Responses API to support agent skills and a complete terminal shell",
          "standfirst": "Until recently, the practice of building AI agents has been a bit like training a long-distance runner with a thirty-second memory. Yes, you could give your AI models tools and instructions, but after a few dozen interactions — several laps around the track, to extend our running analogy — it would inevitably lose context and start hallucinating. With OpenAI&#x27;s latest updates to its Responses API — the application programming interface that allows developers on OpenAI&#x27;s platform to access multiple agentic tools like web search and file search with a single call — the company is signaling that the era of the limited agent is waning. The updates announced today include Server-side Compaction, Hosted Shell Containers, and implementing the new \"Skills\" standard for agents.With these three major updates, OpenAI is effectively handing agents a permanent desk, a terminal, and a memory that doesn’t fade and should help agents evolve furhter into reliable, long-term digital workers.Technology: overcoming &#x27;context amnesia&#x27; The most significant technical hurdle for autonomous agents has always been the \"clutter\" of long-running tasks. Every time an agent calls a tool or runs a script, the conversation history grows. Eventually, the model hits its token limit, and the developer is forced to truncate the history—often deleting the very \"reasoning\" the agent needs to finish the job.OpenAI’s answer is Server-side Compaction. Unlike simple truncation, compaction allows agents to run for hours or even days. Early data from e-commerce platform Triple Whale suggests this is a breakthrough in stability: their agent, Moby, successfully navigated a session involving 5 million tokens and 150 tool calls without a drop in accuracy.In practical terms, this means the model can \"summarize\" its own past actions into a compressed state, keeping the essential context alive while clearing the noise. It transforms the model from a forgetful assistant into a persistent system process.Managed cloud sandboxesThe introduction of the Shell Tool moves OpenAI into the realm of managed compute. Developers can now opt for container_auto, which provisions an OpenAI-hosted Debian 12 environment.This isn&#x27;t just a code interpreter: it gives each agent its own full terminal environment pre-loaded with:Native execution environments including Python 3.11, Node.js 22, Java 17, Go 1.23, and Ruby 3.1.Persistent storage via /mnt/data, allowing agents to generate, save, and download artifacts.Networking capabilities that allow agents to reach out to the internet to install libraries or interact with third-party APIs.The Hosted Shell and its persistent /mnt/data storage provide a managed environment where agents can perform complex data transformations using Python or Java without requiring the team to build and maintain custom ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) middleware for every AI project. By leveraging these hosted containers, data engineers can implement high-performance data processing tasks while minimizing the \"multiple responsibilities\" that come with managing bespoke infrastructure, removing the overhead of building and securing their own sandboxes. OpenAI is essentially saying: “Give us the instructions; we’ll provide the computer.”OpenAI&#x27;s Skills vs. Anthropic&#x27;s SkillsBoth OpenAI and Anthropic now support \"skills,\" instructions for agents to run specific operations, and have converged on the same open standard — a SKILL.md (markdown) manifest with YAML frontmatter.A skill built for either can theoretically be moved to VS Code, Cursor, or any other platform that adopts the specificationIndeed, the hit new open source AI agent OpenClaw adopted this exact SKILL.md manifest and folder-based packaging, allowing it to inherit a wealth of specialized procedural knowledge originally designed for Claude. This architectural compatibility has fueled a community-driven \"skills boom\" on platforms like ClawHub, which now hosts over 3,000 community-built extensions ranging from smart home integrations to complex enterprise workflow automations.This cross-pollination demonstrates that the \"Skill\" has become a portable, versioned asset rather than a vendor-locked feature. Because OpenClaw supports multiple models — including OpenAI’s GPT-5 series and local Llama instances — developers can now write a skill once and deploy it across a heterogeneous landscape of agents. But the underlying strategies of OpenAI and Anthropic reveal divergent visions for the future of work.OpenAI’s approach prioritizes a \"programmable substrate\" optimized for developer velocity.

          "content": "Until recently, the practice of building AI agents has been a bit like training a long-distance runner with a thirty-second memory. Yes, you could give your AI models tools and instructions, but after a few dozen interactions — several laps around the track, to extend our running analogy — it would inevitably lose context and start hallucinating. With OpenAI&#x27;s latest updates to its Responses API — the application programming interface that allows developers on OpenAI&#x27;s platform to access multiple agentic tools like web search and file search with a single call — the company is signaling that the era of the limited agent is waning. The updates announced today include Server-side Compaction, Hosted Shell Containers, and implementing the new \"Skills\" standard for agents.With these three major updates, OpenAI is effectively handing agents a permanent desk, a terminal, and a memory that doesn’t fade and should help agents evolve furhter into reliable, long-term digital workers.Technology: overcoming &#x27;context amnesia&#x27; The most significant technical hurdle for autonomous agents has always been the \"clutter\" of long-running tasks. Every time an agent calls a tool or runs a script, the conversation history grows. Eventually, the model hits its token limit, and the developer is forced to truncate the history—often deleting the very \"reasoning\" the agent needs to finish the job.OpenAI’s answer is Server-side Compaction. Unlike simple truncation, compaction allows agents to run for hours or even days. Early data from e-commerce platform Triple Whale suggests this is a breakthrough in stability: their agent, Moby, successfully navigated a session involving 5 million tokens and 150 tool calls without a drop in accuracy.In practical terms, this means the model can \"summarize\" its own past actions into a compressed state, keeping the essential context alive while clearing the noise. It transforms the model from a forgetful assistant into a persistent system process.Managed cloud sandboxesThe introduction of the Shell Tool moves OpenAI into the realm of managed compute. Developers can now opt for container_auto, which provisions an OpenAI-hosted Debian 12 environment.This isn&#x27;t just a code interpreter: it gives each agent its own full terminal environment pre-loaded with:Native execution environments including Python 3.11, Node.js 22, Java 17, Go 1.23, and Ruby 3.1.Persistent storage via /mnt/data, allowing agents to generate, save, and download artifacts.Networking capabilities that allow agents to reach out to the internet to install libraries or interact with third-party APIs.The Hosted Shell and its persistent /mnt/data storage provide a managed environment where agents can perform complex data transformations using Python or Java without requiring the team to build and maintain custom ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) middleware for every AI project. By leveraging these hosted containers, data engineers can implement high-performance data processing tasks while minimizing the \"multiple responsibilities\" that come with managing bespoke infrastructure, removing the overhead of building and securing their own sandboxes. OpenAI is essentially saying: “Give us the instructions; we’ll provide the computer.”OpenAI&#x27;s Skills vs. Anthropic&#x27;s SkillsBoth OpenAI and Anthropic now support \"skills,\" instructions for agents to run specific operations, and have converged on the same open standard — a SKILL.md (markdown) manifest with YAML frontmatter.A skill built for either can theoretically be moved to VS Code, Cursor, or any other platform that adopts the specificationIndeed, the hit new open source AI agent OpenClaw adopted this exact SKILL.md manifest and folder-based packaging, allowing it to inherit a wealth of specialized procedural knowledge originally designed for Claude. This architectural compatibility has fueled a community-driven \"skills boom\" on platforms like ClawHub, which now hosts over 3,000 community-built extensions ranging from smart home integrations to complex enterprise workflow automations.This cross-pollination demonstrates that the \"Skill\" has become a portable, versioned asset rather than a vendor-locked feature. Because OpenClaw supports multiple models — including OpenAI’s GPT-5 series and local Llama instances — developers can now write a skill once and deploy it across a heterogeneous landscape of agents. But the underlying strategies of OpenAI and Anthropic reveal divergent visions for the future of work.OpenAI’s approach prioritizes a \"programmable substrate\" optimized for developer velocity. By bundling the shell, the memory, and the skills into the Responses API, they offer a \"turnkey\" experience for building complex agents rapidly.Already, enterprise AI search startup Glean reported a jump in tool accuracy from 73% to 85% by using OpenAI&#x27;s Skills framework.By pairing the open standard with its proprietary Responses API, the company provides a high-performance, turnkey substrate.

          "standfirst": "RAG isn&#x27;t always fast enough or intelligent enough for modern agentic AI workflows. As teams move from short-lived chatbots to long-running, tool-heavy agents embedded in production systems, those limitations are becoming harder to work around.In response, teams are experimenting with alternative memory architectures — sometimes called contextual memory or agentic memory — that prioritize persistence and stability over dynamic retrieval.One of the more recent implementations of this approach is \"observational memory,\" an open-source technology developed by Mastra, which was founded by the engineers who previously built and sold the Gatsby framework to Netlify.Unlike RAG systems that retrieve context dynamically, observational memory uses two background agents (Observer and Reflector) to compress conversation history into a dated observation log. The compressed observations stay in context, eliminating retrieval entirely. For text content, the system achieves 3-6x compression. For tool-heavy agent workloads generating large outputs, compression ratios hit 5-40x.The tradeoff is that observational memory prioritizes what the agent has already seen and decided over searching a broader external corpus, making it less suitable for open-ended knowledge discovery or compliance-heavy recall use cases.The system scored 94.87% on LongMemEval using GPT-5-mini, while maintaining a completely stable, cacheable context window. On the standard GPT-4o model, observational memory scored 84.23% compared to Mastra&#x27;s own RAG implementation at 80.05%.\"It has this great characteristic of being both simpler and it is more powerful, like it scores better on the benchmarks,\" Sam Bhagwat, co-founder and CEO of Mastra, told VentureBeat.How it works: Two agents compress history into observationsThe architecture is simpler than traditional memory systems but delivers better results. Observational memory divides the context window into two blocks. The first contains observations — compressed, dated notes extracted from previous conversations. The second holds raw message history from the current session.Two background agents manage the compression process. When unobserved messages hit 30,000 tokens (configurable), the Observer agent compresses them into new observations and appends them to the first block. The original messages get dropped. When observations reach 40,000 tokens (also configurable), the Reflector agent restructures and condenses the observation log, combining related items and removing superseded information.\"The way that you&#x27;re sort of compressing these messages over time is you&#x27;re actually just sort of getting messages, and then you have an agent sort of say, &#x27;OK, so what are the key things to remember from this set of messages?&#x27;\" Bhagwat said. \"You kind of compress it, and then you get in another 30,000 tokens, and you compress that.\"The format is text-based, not structured objects. No vector databases or graph databases required.Stable context windows cut token costs up to 10xThe economics of observational memory come from prompt caching. Anthropic, OpenAI, and other providers reduce token costs by 4-10x for cached prompts versus those that are uncached. Most memory systems can&#x27;t take advantage of this because they change the prompt every turn by injecting dynamically retrieved context, which invalidates the cache. For production teams, that instability translates directly into unpredictable cost curves and harder-to-budget agent workloads.Observational memory keeps the context stable. The observation block is append-only until reflection runs, which means the system prompt and existing observations form a consistent prefix that can be cached across many turns. Messages keep getting appended to the raw history block until the 30,000 token threshold hits. Every turn before that is a full cache hit.When observation runs, messages are replaced with new observations appended to the existing observation block. The observation prefix stays consistent, so the system still gets a partial cache hit. Only during reflection (which runs infrequently) is the entire cache invalidated.The average context window size for Mastra&#x27;s LongMemEval benchmark run was around 30,000 tokens, far smaller than the full conversation history would require.Why this differs from traditional compactionMost coding agents use compaction to manage long context. Compaction lets the context window fill all the way up, then compresses the entire history into a summary when it&#x27;s about to overflow. The agent continues, the window fills again, and the process repeats.Compaction produces documentation-style summaries. It captures the gist of what happened but loses specific events, decisions and details. The compression happens in large batches, which makes each pass computationally expensive. That works for human readability, but it often strips out the specific decisions and tool interactions agents need to act consistently over time.The Observer, on the other hand, runs more frequently, processing smaller chunks. Instead of summarizing the conversation, it produces an event-based decision log — a structured list of dated, prioritized observations about what specifically happened. Each observation cycle handles less context and compresses it more efficiently.The log never gets summarized into a blob. Even during reflection, the Reflector reorganizes and condenses the observations to find connections and drop redundant data. But the event-based structure persists. The result reads like a log of decisions and actions, not documentation.Enterprise use cases: Long-running agent conversationsMastra&#x27;s customers span several categories. Some build in-app chatbots for CMS platforms like Sanity or Contentful. Others create AI SRE systems that help engineering teams triage alerts. Document processing agents handle paperwork for traditional businesses moving toward automation.What these use cases share is the need for long-running conversations that maintain context across weeks or months. An agent embedded in a content management system needs to remember that three weeks ago the user asked for a specific report format. An SRE agent needs to track which alerts were investigated and what decisions were made.\"One of the big goals for 2025 and 2026 has been building an agent inside their web app,\" Bhagwat said about B2B SaaS companies. \"That agent needs to be able to remember that, like, three weeks ago, you asked me about this thing, or you said you wanted a report on this kind of content type, or views segmented by this metric.\"In those scenarios, memory stops being an optimization and becomes a product requirement — users notice immediately when agents forget prior decisions or preferences.Observational memory keeps months of conversation history present and accessible. The agent can respond while remembering the full context, without requiring the user to re-explain preferences or previous decisions.The system shipped as part of Mastra 1.0 and is available now. The team released plug-ins this week for LangChain, Vercel&#x27;s AI SDK, and other frameworks, enabling developers to use observational memory outside the Mastra ecosystem.What it means for production AI systemsObservational memory offers a different architectural approach than the vector database and RAG pipelines that dominate current implementations. The simpler architecture (text-based, no specialized databases) makes it easier to debug and maintain. The stable context window enables aggressive caching that cuts costs. The benchmark performance suggests that the approach can work at scale.For enterprise teams evaluating memory approaches, the key questions are:How much context do your agents need to maintain across sessions?What&#x27;s your tolerance for lossy compression versus full-corpus search?Do you need the dynamic retrieval that RAG provides, or would stable context work better?Are your agents tool-heavy, generating large amounts of output that needs compression?The answers determine whether observational memory fits your use case. Bhagwat positions memory as one of the top primitives needed for high-performing agents, alongside tool use, workflow orchestration, observability, and guardrails. For enterprise agents embedded in products, forgetting context between sessions is unacceptable. Users expect agents to remember their preferences, previous decisions and ongoing work.\"The hardest thing for teams building agents is the production, which can take time,\" Bhagwat said. \"Memory is a really important bit in that, because it&#x27;s just jarring if you use any sort of agentic tool and you sort of told it something and then it just kind of forgot it.\"As agents move from experiments to embedded systems of record, how teams design memory may matter as much as which model they choose.",

The benchmark performance suggests that the approach can work at scale.For enterprise teams evaluating memory approaches, the key questions are:How much context do your agents need to maintain across sessions?What&#x27;s your tolerance for lossy compression versus full-corpus search?Do you need the dynamic retrieval that RAG provides, or would stable context work better?Are your agents tool-heavy, generating large amounts of output that needs compression?The answers determine whether observational memory fits your use case. Bhagwat positions memory as one of the top primitives needed for high-performing agents, alongside tool use, workflow orchestration, observability, and guardrails. For enterprise agents embedded in products, forgetting context between sessions is unacceptable. Users expect agents to remember their preferences, previous decisions and ongoing work.\"The hardest thing for teams building agents is the production, which can take time,\" Bhagwat said. \"Memory is a really important bit in that, because it&#x27;s just jarring if you use any sort of agentic tool and you sort of told it something and then it just kind of forgot it.\"As agents move from experiments to embedded systems of record, how teams design memory may matter as much as which model they choose.",

The program comes from the Mental Health Coalition’s Safe Online Standards (SOS) initiative, which comprises about two dozen standards covering areas like platform policy, functionality, governance and transparency, content oversight and more. The SOS initiative is led by Dr. Dan Reidenberg, Managing Director of the National Council for Suicide Prevention. In announcing these companies' participation, the Mental Health Coalition writes \"SOS establishes clear, user-informed data for how social media, gaming, and digital platforms design products, protect users ages 13–19, and address exposure to suicide and self-harm content. Participating companies will voluntarily submit documentation on their policies, tools, and product features, which will be evaluated by an independent panel of global experts.\" After evaluation, the platforms will be given one of three ratings. The highest achievable safety rating is \"use carefully,\" which comes with a blue badge that compliant platforms can display. Despite being the highest rating, the requirements seem fairly run-of-the-mill. The description includes things like \"reporting tools are accessible and easy to use,\" and \"privacy, default and safety functions are clear and easy to set for parents.\" As for what actions the standards ask of the companies being rated, the \"use carefully\" rating says \"platforms and filters help reduce exposure to harmful or inappropriate content.\" The other ratings include \"partial protection\" which is described in part as \"some safety tools exist on the platforms, but can be hard to find or use,\" and \"does not meet standards\" which would be given if \"filters and content moderation do not reliably block harmful or unsafe content.\" The Mental Health Coalition, founded in 2020, has mentioned Facebook and Meta as partners since the early days of the organization. In 2021 the organization said it would bring together \"leading mental health experts partner with Facebook and Instagram to destigmatize mental health and connect people to resources\" during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022 the nonprofit published a case study with \"support from Meta\" that found \"mental health content on social media can reduce stigma while increasing individuals’ likelihood to seek resources, therefore positively impacting mental health.\" In 2024, the MHC \"in partnership with Meta\" launched a campaign called the Time Well Spent Challenge. In it, the group urged parents to have “meaningful conversations” with teens about “healthy” social media use, focusing less on whether teens should be on these apps at all and more on keeping them on-platform in a “time well spent” way, from reduced screen time to “using social media for good” and reviewing their feeds together. That same year it partnered with Meta again to establish \"Thrive,\" a program that allows tech companies to share data regarding materials that violate self-harm or suicide content guidelines. The Mental Health Coalition lists Meta as a \"creative partner\" on its website. Last year it was alleged that Meta buried internal data showing the ill effects of its products on users' mental health. The internal research, dubbed \"Project Mercury,\" began in 2020. Since then the company has introduced some bare-minimum attempts at addressing mental health concerns, such as Instagram teen accounts. Meta is now on trial in California facing allegations over child harm from addictive products, the first in a series of upcoming lawsuits against the social media giant. Other companies participating in the rating program include Roblox, which has recently faced stiff accusations over the wellbeing of children on the platform, and Discord which has beefed up its age-verification processes in response to its own serious child endangerment concerns.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-tiktok-and-snap-are-participating-in-an-online-safety-ratings-system-162921333.html?src=rss",

          "title": "ASUS Zenbook Duo (2026) review: Two screens really are better than one",
          "standfirst": "It takes time for novel designs to catch on. But even so, I am still wondering why the Zenbook Duo hasn't had a bigger impact on the market after ASUS released its first true dual-screen laptop two years ago. Notebooks like these provide the kind of screen space you'd typically only get from a dual monitor setup, but in a much more compact form factor that you can easily take on the road. It could be that people were wary of an unfamiliar design, shorter battery life or buying a first-gen product — all of which are understandable concerns. However, now that ASUS has given the ZenBook Duo a total redesign for 2026, the company has addressed practically all of those barriers to entry while making it an even more convincing machine for anyone who could use more display space. Which, in my experience, is pretty much everyone. Editor’s note: The 2026 ASUS Zenbook Duo is expected to be available for pre-order sometime in late February, with general availability slated for March. Design For the new model, ASUS didn't mess with the laptop's basic layout too much. Instead, the company polished and tightened everything up, resulting in a system that weighs about the same (3.6 pounds) while reducing its overall size (12.1 x 8.2 x 0.77 to 0.92 inches) by five percent. Critically, you still get a built-in kickstand on the bottom and a detachable keyboard that you move wherever you want. There’s also a decent number of ports, including two USB-C with Thunderbolt 4, one USB-A 3.2 jack, HDMI 2.1 and a combo audio port. That said, I do wish ASUS had found room for an SD card reader of some kind, though given the Zenbook Duo's unique design, I get why that didn't make it. The Zenbook Duo's detachable keyboard gives users a ton of flexibility when it comes to utilizing both of the laptop's displays. Sam Rutherford for Engadget One of the Zenbook Duo's most important design upgrades is a new \"hideaway\" hinge that reduces the gap between the laptop's two screens. Not only does this make the laptop easier and more pleasant to use in dual-screen mode, it also allows the entire system to lay flat on a table, which is nice for drawing or sharing your screen with someone sitting opposite you. Unfortunately, while my review unit didn’t come with one, ASUS says its forthcoming Pen 3.0 will come bundled with the Zenbook Duo in the US, so you won’t need to pay extra for it. Another small but appreciated improvement is the new pogo pins below the lower display, which provides a more secure and reliable way of keeping the laptop's detachable keyboard topped up. In my experience, even after running multiple rundown tests that completely drained the Duo's battery, I never had to charge up the keyboard on its own. It was always smart enough to sip electricity from the main system in the background, though it also has a built-in USB-C port for power just in case. On the flipside, if you're not scared of typing on glass, you can still use the lower screen as a keyboard and touchpad, or as a place to display widgets for news, the weather, performance and more. Displays As someone who loves a desktop with dual monitors, I can't overstate how nice it is to have similar built-in functionality on a laptop. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The standout feature on the Zenbook Duo continues to be its dual displays, and now for 2026, they look better than ever. Both OLED panels have a 144Hz refresh rate with a 2,880 x 1,800 resolution while also covering 100 percent of the DCI-P3 spectrum. And while its nominal brightness of 500 nits for SDR content is just OK, ASUS makes up for that with peaks of up to 1,000 nits in HDR. And to make both screens even more enjoyable, ASUS managed to shrink the size of their bezels down to just 8.28mm. That's a reduction of 70 percent compared to the previous model, so now there's even less getting in the way of you utilizing these screens to their fullest. Performance The Zenbook Duo can be configured with a range of new Intel Core Ultra 7 and Core Ultra 9 processors, including the X9 388H chip used on our review unit. For general use and productivity, the laptop is super smooth and responsive, though that shouldn't be a surprise coming from Intel's latest top-of-the-line mobile CPU. However, for those seeking max performance, some of the benchmark numbers aren't quite as impressive as you might expect. That’s because ASUS has limited the Duo's TDP (thermal design power) to 45 watts — which is shy of the chip's 80-watt turbo power limit. The kickstand in back adds a bit a bulk, but it's better than not having one at all like with Lenovo's Yoga Book. Sam Rutherford for Engadget In PCMark 10, the Zenbook Duo only managed a score of 7,153 compared to 9,651 from a Dell XPS 14, despite the latter having a lower-tier Intel Core Ultra X7 358H processor. That said, in other tests like Geekbench 6, the Duo had no trouble staying on top with a multicore score of 17,095 versus 9,651 for the Dell. Another pleasant surprise is that because the Duo's chip comes with Intel's upgraded Arc B390 integrated GPU, this thing has plenty of oomph to game on, let alone edit videos or other similar tasks. In Elden Ring at 1,920 x 1,200, the Zenbook maintained a relatively stable framerate between 55 and 60 fps on high settings, which is great considering this thing doesn't have discrete graphics. This means as long as you don't mind fiddling with game options a bit, you should be able to play newer AAA games without too much trouble. Battery life The left side of the Zenbook Duo features a full-size HDMI connector along with a USB-C port, plus a backup USB-C jack for charging the detachable keyboard. Sam Rutherford for Engadget You'd think a laptop with two displays would be super power hungry. However, by increasing the capacity of its cell from 75WHrs to 99WHrs, ASUS has made the Zenbook Duo's endurance (or lack thereof) a complete non-issue. On PCMark 10's Modern Office rundown test, the laptop lasted 18 hours and 33 minutes in single-screen mode. Granted, that's nearly four hours less than what we got from MSI's Prestige 14 Flip AI+, but considering that's the longest-lasting notebook we've ever tested, I'm not bothered. When compared to ASUS' own Zenbook A14 (18:16), things are basically a wash, which I think is a win for the Duo, as the A14 is meant to be an ultralight system with an emphasis on portability and longevity. Obviously, battery life takes a hit when you're using both displays. However, when I re-ran our battery test with its two displays turned on, the Duo still impressed with a time of 14:23. This is more than enough to give you the confidence to set this thing up in dual-screen mode even when an outlet isn't close at hand. Thankfully, for times when you do need a power adapter, the charging brick on ASUS' cable is rather compact, so it's not a chore to lug it around. Wrap-up The Zenbook Duo's battery life is good enough you won't always need its power brick. Thankfully, when you do, ASUS' 100-watt adapter is relatively compact. Sam Rutherford for Engadget I'm a believer that one day people will eventually embrace typing on screens with laptops just like they have for smartphones. However, even if you're not willing to make that jump just yet, the Zenbook Duo still has all of its bases covered. Its detachable keyboard gives you a pleasant experience while freeing up the bottom of the notebook to be a second display. This allows you to have something similar to a traditional dual-monitor desktop but in a chassis that you can easily take on the road without any major compromises. The 2026 Zenbook Duo combines a compact design with strong performance, plenty of ports and surprisingly good battery life. Sure, it's a touch heavier than a typical 14-inch laptop, but its two screens more than make up for a little added weight and thickness. That leaves price as the Duo's remaining drawback, and starting at $2,100 (or $2,300 as reviewed), it certainly isn't cheap. However, when you consider that a similarly equipped rival like a Dell XPS 14 costs just $50 less for a single screen, that price difference is rather negligible. Alternatively, if you opt for a more affordable ultraportable and then tack on a decent third-party portable monitor, you're still likely looking at a package that costs between $1,500 and $1,800. Plus, that setup is significantly bulkier and more annoying to carry around. So while the Zenbook Duo might be an unconventional pick right now, it has all the tools to deliver unmatched portable productivity and I don’t think it will be too much longer until the masses catch on.

          "content": "It takes time for novel designs to catch on. But even so, I am still wondering why the Zenbook Duo hasn't had a bigger impact on the market after ASUS released its first true dual-screen laptop two years ago. Notebooks like these provide the kind of screen space you'd typically only get from a dual monitor setup, but in a much more compact form factor that you can easily take on the road. It could be that people were wary of an unfamiliar design, shorter battery life or buying a first-gen product — all of which are understandable concerns. However, now that ASUS has given the ZenBook Duo a total redesign for 2026, the company has addressed practically all of those barriers to entry while making it an even more convincing machine for anyone who could use more display space. Which, in my experience, is pretty much everyone. Editor’s note: The 2026 ASUS Zenbook Duo is expected to be available for pre-order sometime in late February, with general availability slated for March. Design For the new model, ASUS didn't mess with the laptop's basic layout too much. Instead, the company polished and tightened everything up, resulting in a system that weighs about the same (3.6 pounds) while reducing its overall size (12.1 x 8.2 x 0.77 to 0.92 inches) by five percent. Critically, you still get a built-in kickstand on the bottom and a detachable keyboard that you move wherever you want. There’s also a decent number of ports, including two USB-C with Thunderbolt 4, one USB-A 3.2 jack, HDMI 2.1 and a combo audio port. That said, I do wish ASUS had found room for an SD card reader of some kind, though given the Zenbook Duo's unique design, I get why that didn't make it. The Zenbook Duo's detachable keyboard gives users a ton of flexibility when it comes to utilizing both of the laptop's displays. Sam Rutherford for Engadget One of the Zenbook Duo's most important design upgrades is a new \"hideaway\" hinge that reduces the gap between the laptop's two screens. Not only does this make the laptop easier and more pleasant to use in dual-screen mode, it also allows the entire system to lay flat on a table, which is nice for drawing or sharing your screen with someone sitting opposite you. Unfortunately, while my review unit didn’t come with one, ASUS says its forthcoming Pen 3.0 will come bundled with the Zenbook Duo in the US, so you won’t need to pay extra for it. Another small but appreciated improvement is the new pogo pins below the lower display, which provides a more secure and reliable way of keeping the laptop's detachable keyboard topped up. In my experience, even after running multiple rundown tests that completely drained the Duo's battery, I never had to charge up the keyboard on its own. It was always smart enough to sip electricity from the main system in the background, though it also has a built-in USB-C port for power just in case. On the flipside, if you're not scared of typing on glass, you can still use the lower screen as a keyboard and touchpad, or as a place to display widgets for news, the weather, performance and more. Displays As someone who loves a desktop with dual monitors, I can't overstate how nice it is to have similar built-in functionality on a laptop. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The standout feature on the Zenbook Duo continues to be its dual displays, and now for 2026, they look better than ever. Both OLED panels have a 144Hz refresh rate with a 2,880 x 1,800 resolution while also covering 100 percent of the DCI-P3 spectrum. And while its nominal brightness of 500 nits for SDR content is just OK, ASUS makes up for that with peaks of up to 1,000 nits in HDR. And to make both screens even more enjoyable, ASUS managed to shrink the size of their bezels down to just 8.28mm. That's a reduction of 70 percent compared to the previous model, so now there's even less getting in the way of you utilizing these screens to their fullest. Performance The Zenbook Duo can be configured with a range of new Intel Core Ultra 7 and Core Ultra 9 processors, including the X9 388H chip used on our review unit. For general use and productivity, the laptop is super smooth and responsive, though that shouldn't be a surprise coming from Intel's latest top-of-the-line mobile CPU. However, for those seeking max performance, some of the benchmark numbers aren't quite as impressive as you might expect. That’s because ASUS has limited the Duo's TDP (thermal design power) to 45 watts — which is shy of the chip's 80-watt turbo power limit. The kickstand in back adds a bit a bulk, but it's better than not having one at all like with Lenovo's Yoga Book. Sam Rutherford for Engadget In PCMark 10, the Zenbook Duo only managed a score of 7,153 compared to 9,651 from a Dell XPS 14, despite the latter having a lower-tier Intel Core Ultra X7 358H processor. That said, in other tests like Geekbench 6, the Duo had no trouble staying on top with a multicore score of 17,095 versus 9,651 for the Dell. Another pleasant surprise is that because the Duo's chip comes with Intel's upgraded Arc B390 integrated GPU, this thing has plenty of oomph to game on, let alone edit videos or other similar tasks. In Elden Ring at 1,920 x 1,200, the Zenbook maintained a relatively stable framerate between 55 and 60 fps on high settings, which is great considering this thing doesn't have discrete graphics. This means as long as you don't mind fiddling with game options a bit, you should be able to play newer AAA games without too much trouble. Battery life The left side of the Zenbook Duo features a full-size HDMI connector along with a USB-C port, plus a backup USB-C jack for charging the detachable keyboard. Sam Rutherford for Engadget You'd think a laptop with two displays would be super power hungry. However, by increasing the capacity of its cell from 75WHrs to 99WHrs, ASUS has made the Zenbook Duo's endurance (or lack thereof) a complete non-issue. On PCMark 10's Modern Office rundown test, the laptop lasted 18 hours and 33 minutes in single-screen mode. Granted, that's nearly four hours less than what we got from MSI's Prestige 14 Flip AI+, but considering that's the longest-lasting notebook we've ever tested, I'm not bothered.

Construction workers first carved the footprint for the launch pad from the Florida wetlands more than 60 years ago. NASA used the site to launch Saturn V rockets dispatching astronauts to the Moon, then converted the pad for the Space Shuttle program. The last shuttle flight lifted off from Pad 39A in 2011, and the agency leased the site to SpaceX for use as the departure point for the company's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. SpaceX started launching from Pad 39A in 2017, then installed a new Crew Access Arm on the pad's tower the following year, replacing the aging shuttle-era arm that connected to the hatches of NASA's orbiters. SpaceX added the new arm ahead of the first test flight of the company's human-rated Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2019. Astronauts started using the pathway, suspended more than 200 feet above the pad surface, beginning with the first crew flight on a Dragon spacecraft in 2020.Read full article Comments",

Coal is the second most expensive source of power for the US grid, eclipsed by gas, wind, solar, hydro—everything other than nuclear power. It also produces the most pollution, including particulates that damage human lungs, chemicals that contribute to acid rain, and coal ash that contains many toxic metals. It also emits the most carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced. Prior to Trump's return to office, the US grid had been rapidly moving away from its use, including during his first term. Despite the long-standing Republican claims to support free markets, the second Trump administration has determined that the only way to keep coal viable is direct government intervention. Its initial attempts involved declaring an energy emergency and then using that to justify forcing coal plants slated for closure to continue operations. The emergency declaration relied on what appears to be a tenuous interpretation of the Federal Power Act, and the administration was already facing a lawsuit challenging these actions.Read full article Comments",

Lumma, also known as Lumma Stealer, first appeared in Russian-speaking cybercrime forums in 2022.

Tinney went on to paint more than 80 covers for Byte, working almost entirely in airbrushed Designers Gouache, a medium he chose for its opaque, intense colors and smooth finish. He said the process of creating each cover typically took about a week of painting once a design was approved, following phone conversations with editors about each issue's theme.

          "content": "On Wednesday, former OpenAI researcher Zoë Hitzig published a guest essay in The New York Times announcing that she resigned from the company on Monday, the same day OpenAI began testing advertisements inside ChatGPT. Hitzig, an economist and published poet who holds a junior fellowship at the Harvard Society of Fellows, spent two years at OpenAI helping shape how its AI models were built and priced. She wrote that OpenAI's advertising strategy risks repeating the same mistakes that Facebook made a decade ago. \"I once believed I could help the people building A.I. get ahead of the problems it would create,\" Hitzig wrote. \"This week confirmed my slow realization that OpenAI seems to have stopped asking the questions I'd joined to help answer.\" Hitzig did not call advertising itself immoral. Instead, she argued that the nature of the data at stake makes ChatGPT ads especially risky. Users have shared medical fears, relationship problems, and religious beliefs with the chatbot, she wrote, often \"because people believed they were talking to something that had no ulterior agenda.\" She called this accumulated record of personal disclosures \"an archive of human candor that has no precedent.\"Read full article Comments",

          "content": "The pre-Inca Chincha Kingdom (circa 1000-1400 CE), along Peru's southern coast, was one of the most wealthy and influential of its time before falling to the Inca and Spanish empires. Scientists have long puzzled over the foundation for that prosperity, and it seems one critical factor was bird poop, according to a new paper published in the journal PLoS ONE. “Seabird guano may seem trivial, yet our study suggests this potent resource could have significantly contributed to sociopolitical and economic change in the Peruvian Andes,” said co-author Jacob Bongers, a digital archaeologist at the University of Sydney. “Guano dramatically boosted the production of maize (corn), and this agricultural surplus crucially helped fuel the Chincha Kingdom’s economy, driving their trade, wealth, population growth and regional influence, and shaped their strategic alliance with the Inca Empire. In ancient Andean cultures, fertiliser was power.” Last November, Bongers co-authored a paper detailing evidence supporting the hypothesis that the mysterious \"Band of Holes\" on Mount Sierpe in the Andes might have been an ancient marketplace. Aerial photographs from the 1930s first revealed that long row of around 5,200 precisely aligned holes, seemingly organized into blocked sections, most likely constructed by the Chincha Kingdom. Scholars had suggested various hypotheses for what the site's purpose may have been: defense, storage, or accounting, perhaps, or maybe to collect water and capture fog for local gardens. But nobody had any strong evidence for those suggestions.Read full article Comments",

These feature updates sometimes include new Windows features and other changes that are too large to roll out in a typical monthly Windows Update, and users need to upgrade to new ones to keep getting security patches and other features. The currently supported versions are Windows 11 24H2 and 25H2, released in the fall of 2024 and 2025, respectively. This week, Microsoft disrupted that update cadence by announcing more information on Windows 11 26H1, which is best described not as an update to Windows 11 but as another version of the operating system entirely. That's because 26H1 is a \"scoped\" release intended exclusively for new PCs, starting with those based on Qualcomm's recently announced Snapdragon X2 Elite chips. Microsoft's support page explains why this release is strange: It won't be released broadly to other Windows 11 PCs, which should continue to use either 24H2 or 25H2. PCs running 24H2 or 25H2 will never be offered an update to version 26H1, though testers in the Windows Insider Program's early access Canary channel are able to install it to other PCs if they want. (Build numbers for Windows 11 26H1 start with 28000, compared to 26100 for 24H2 and 26200 for 25H2.)Read full article Comments",

That video may not vanish into the digital aether right on time, though. Investigators involved with the high-profile abduction of Nancy Guthrie have released video from Guthrie's Nest doorbell camera—video that was believed to have been deleted because Guthrie wasn't paying for the service. Google's cameras connect to the recently upgraded Home Premium subscription service. For $10 per month, you get 30 days of stored events, and $20 gets you 60 days of events with 10 days of the full video. If you don't pay anything, Google only saves three hours of event history. After that, the videos are deleted, at least as far as the user is concerned. Newer Nest cameras have limited local storage that can cache clips for a few hours in case connectivity drops out, but there is no option for true local storage. Guthrie's camera was reportedly destroyed by the perpetrators. Suspect in abduction approaches doorbell camera. Expired videos are no longer available to the user, and Google won't restore them even if you later upgrade to a premium account. However, that doesn't mean the data is truly gone. Nancy Guthrie was abducted from her home in the early hours of February 1, and at first, investigators said there was no video of the crime because the doorbell camera was not on a paid account. Yet, video showing a masked individual fiddling with the camera was published on February 10.Read full article Comments",

The 26.3 updates for these operating systems are fairly mild, focusing mostly on bug fixes and security patches, but Apple is adding a handful of iPhone features designed to make it easier to use third-party devices in Apple's ecosystem. The first is a \"transfer to Android\" feature that will facilitate switching away from Apple's phones into the Android ecosystem. Apple offers to transfer \"photos, messages, notes, apps, and more,\" as well as the user's phone number, but won't transfer things like Bluetooth pairing information or sensitive data from the Health app. Whether third-party apps can have their data transferred is likely tied to the AppMigrationKit developer framework that Apple added in iOS 26.1. Apps using this framework can import and export data to and from other devices and also access and download content the app has stored in the cloud. Apple notes that AppMigrationKit only functions for transfers from an Apple device to a non-Apple device; Apple already has several systems in place for preserving and transferring data and settings when upgrading from one iPhone to another.Read full article Comments",

Although it was mostly an invisible update when it worked properly, some users who attempted to switch to the new architecture when it first rolled out in iOS 16.2 ran into slow or unresponsive devices and other problems, prompting Apple to pause the rollout and re-release it as part of iOS 16.4. If you put off transitioning to the new architecture because of those early teething problems or for some other reason, Apple is forcing the issue starting today: You'll need to update to the new Home architecture if you want to continue using the Home app, and older iOS and macOS versions that don't support the new architecture will no longer be able to control your smart home devices. The old version of the Home app and the old Home/HomeKit architecture are no longer supported. If you're like me, you hit an \"upgrade\" button in your Home app years ago and then mostly forgot about it—if you open the Home app on a modern iPhone, iPad, or Mac and don't see an update prompt, it means you're already using the updated architecture and don't need to worry about it.Read full article Comments",

SpaceX announced the milestone in a social media post Tuesday: \"Cryoproof operations complete for the first time with a Super Heavy V3 booster. This multi-day campaign tested the booster's redesigned propellant systems and its structural strength.\" Ground teams at Starbase, Texas, rolled the 237-foot-tall (72.3-meter) stainless-steel booster out of its factory and transported it a few miles away to Massey's Test Site last week. The test crew first performed a pressure test on the rocket at ambient temperatures, then loaded super-cold liquid nitrogen into the rocket four times over six days, putting the booster through repeated thermal and pressurization cycles. The nitrogen is a stand-in for the cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen that will fill the booster's propellant tanks on launch day.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "China's space program, striving to land astronauts on the Moon by 2030, carried out a test flight of a new reusable booster and crew capsule late Tuesday (US time), and the results were spectacular. The demonstration \"marks a significant breakthrough in the development of [China's] manned lunar exploration program,\" the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said in a statement. China and the United States are racing to accomplish the next human landing on the Moon in a competition for national prestige and lunar resources. The Long March 10 rocket and Mengzhou spacecraft, both tested Tuesday, are core elements of China's lunar architecture. The launch of a subscale version of the Long March 10 rocket, still in development, provided engineers with an opportunity to verify the performance of an important part of the new Mengzhou capsule's safety system. The test began with liftoff of the Long March 10 booster from a new launch pad at Wenchang Space Launch Site on Hainan Island, China's southernmost province, at 10 pm EST Tuesday (03:00 UTC or 11 am Beijing time Wednesday).Read full article Comments",

While the move came as a surprise to the high-profile vaccine maker, it is just the latest hostility toward vaccines—and mRNA vaccines in particular—from an agency overseen by the fervent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In his first year in office, Kennedy has already dramatically slashed childhood vaccine recommendations and canceled $500 million in research funding for mRNA vaccines against potential pandemic threats. In a news release late Tuesday, Moderna said it was blindsided by the FDA's refusal, which the FDA cited as being due to the design of the company's Phase 3 trial for its mRNA flu vaccine, dubbed mRNA-1010. Specifically, the FDA's rejection was over the comparator vaccine Moderna used.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "A long time ago, in (I believe) an issue of Car Magazine from the mid-1990s, the designer Gordon Murray shared his thoughts about a possible four-door follow-up to the McLaren F1. Road cars weren't really his thing. Until then, his career had been focused on Formula 1 car design, and he brought that sport's obsession with weight savings with him. Were he to design a sedan, he'd trim the interior with textile, not leather. After all, wool made fine suits and coats, Murray reasoned, and it would save weight. A four-door McLaren never happened during his tenure, nor has one appeared since. Murray now runs his own boutique hypercar company, which also builds no sedans. But the idea that high-end cars could use something other than leather has stuck with me, especially after driving BMW's i7, which debuted in 2022 with a premium cashmere wool interior. More recently, new EVs have experimented with interesting textile alternatives to leather. Two good examples are the BMW iX3 and the Audi A6, though neither can be ordered with these textile options in the US.Read full article Comments",

Option B is to deprecate Archive.today, discouraging future link additions while keeping the existing archived links. Option C is to do nothing and maintain the status quo. Option A in particular would be a huge change, as more than 695,000 links to Archive.today are used across 400,000 or so Wikipedia pages.
