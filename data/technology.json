          "content": "Tesla shareholders voted Thursday to approve Elon Musk’s staggering new pay package, in a move aimed at retaining the controversial CEO’s leadership during a time of great upheaval for the automaker. Over 75 percent of shares voted in favor of the proposal. The vote gives Musk enormous sway over his electric vehicle company, as well as awards him with the largest corporate payout in history. The final tally is expected to be disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in a few days. Musk took the stage at the shareholder meeting in Austin to chants of “Elon! Elon!” and flanked by dancing Optimus robots. “What we’re about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,” he said. The proposed pay package, which was put forward by the board last September, would award Musk more than 423 million additional shares, increasing his stake to about 25 percent from its current level of 15 percent. In order to receive the full compensation, Musk would need to achieve a series of milestones, including raising Tesla’s market capitalization from its current $1.5 trillion to $8.5 trillion in 10 years. Musk must also put into service 1 million robotaxis and sell 12 million more cars, 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions, and 1 million humanoid robots. In the run-up to the vote, Tesla warned shareholders that a failure to approve the enormous payout would risk losing Musk to other endeavors. The compensation package is aimed at luring him back to the EV company, even though Musk seems more motivated by the idea of creating — and controlling — a “robot army.” Musk would need to achieve a series of milestones, including raising Tesla’s market capitalization from its current $1.5 trillion to $8.5 trillion in 10 years. The vote was opposed by some of Tesla’s largest shareholders, including Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, as well as some smaller public pension funds, such as the American Federation of Teachers and various New York City retirement systems. Major proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have also come out against the pay proposal. Musk’s current compensation package, valued at more than $50 billion, was invalidated by a Delaware court last year after a judge found that Tesla’s board lacked sufficient independence from the billionaire CEO. Shareholders had voted twice to approve the hefty compensation, but the judge still upheld her ruling blocking it. Tesla has appealed the decision to the Delaware Supreme Court. The ruling spurred Musk to engineer a proposal to move Tesla’s legal home from Delaware to Texas, which shareholders also approved. The new award comes as the board continues to push the message that Tesla is on the cusp of becoming a leader in AI and robotics, requiring Musk’s steady hand on the helm. In reality, Tesla’s position is shakier than ever. Musk’s support for President Donald Trump and his work at the Department of Government Efficiency to fire tens of thousands of federal workers and cancel humanitarian aid programs spawned a nationwide protest movement and a steep drop in sales. The expiration of the federal EV tax credit is expected to lead to an even further drop in sales. Whether Musk can achieve these audacious goals set out in the pay package seems increasingly at odds with his approach to the technology. Tesla rolled out its first robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, earlier this year — although the service fell short of Musk’s earlier predictions. The cars still all feature safety monitors, either in the driver or passenger seat — though Musk has said they could be removed by the end of the year. The company’s only new product since 2020, the Cybertruck, has widely been considered a consumer flop. And competition from other automakers, especially those in China, has been shrinking Tesla’s market share and sapping its resources.",

While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern day Vice City.” Previously, GTA VI was set to launch on May 26th, 2026. Before that, Rockstar planned to release the game in 2025. It will be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S. “When we set a date, we really do believe in it,” Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick tells The Game Business. “We said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time. And that’s exactly what happened. We feel really good about this release date. It’s in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally we’re really supportive of Rockstar’s approach.” GTA VI will take place in Vice City and stars two protagonists, Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos. “Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them,” according to Rockstar’s description of the second trailer for the game, which was released in May. “But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.” Rockstar’s first GTA VI trailer debuted in late 2023. Last week, Rockstar was accused of union busting after firing 30 to 40 employees. A Rockstar spokesperson told Bloomberg that it took action against a “small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum” and that “this was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”",

The company claims that with the more powerful AI, users will be able to generate “fully cited” research reports on a given topic in just a few minutes.

In April, the group targeted a Ukrainian university with two wipers, a form of malware that aims to permanently destroy sensitive data and often the infrastructure storing it. One wiper, tracked under the name Sting, targeted fleets of Windows computers by scheduling a task named DavaniGulyashaSdeshka, a phrase derived from Russian slang that loosely translates to “eat some goulash,” researchers from ESET said. The other wiper is tracked as Zerlot. A not-so-common target Then, in June and September, Sandworm unleashed multiple wiper variants against a host of Ukrainian critical infrastructure targets, including organizations active in government, energy, and logistics. The targets have long been in the crosshairs of Russian hackers. There was, however, a fourth, less common target—organizations in Ukraine’s grain industry.Read full article Comments",

Since then, it has been boosting the resolution and filling in the details of an environment dominated by the most extreme gravity in the Universe. But which gravity are we talking about? Because of its incompatibility with quantum mechanics and our current inability to explain dark matter, people have proposed all sorts of variants of gravity that go beyond general relativity and clean up some of the physics’ awkwardness. It’s possible that the extreme environment near a black hole amplifies the differences among at least some of these hypotheses. So, a group of physicists decided to see whether any of those differences might be large enough that the next generation of telescopes might be able to rule out some potential replacements for relativity. Searching for subtlety Any replacement for general relativity faces an awkward challenge: General relativity does pretty well at explaining everything from the large-scale structure of the Universe to phenomena we can measure right here on Earth. So, any alternative theories would have to differ from relativity in very subtle ways that might be extremely difficult to detect.Read full article Comments",

However, the initiative has been a fiasco from the start. After construction began in 2011, the project was beset by hunger strikes, claims of unpaid workers, and the theft of $126 million. Additionally, a man driving a diamond-encrusted Mercedes was arrested after embezzling $75,000. Five years ago, there was another purge of top officials after another round of corruption. Through it all, there has been some progress. In 2016, a Soyuz-2 rocket launched from the first pad, “1S.” And eight years later, a second pad, “1A,” opened with a successful Angara rocket launch. Eventually, the Russian space corporation, Roscosmos, would like to operate seven launch pads at the Vostochny in the far eastern area of Russia, so development work continues.Read full article Comments",

About two dozen current and former Food and Drug Administration officials blame the pullback on deep staffing cuts under the Trump administration. The stark reduction marks a dramatic shift in oversight at a time when the United States has never been more dependent on foreign food, which accounts for the vast majority of the nation’s seafood and more than half its fresh fruit. The stakes are high: Foreign products have been increasingly linked to outbreaks of foodborne illness. In recent years, FDA investigators have uncovered disturbing lapses in facilities producing food bound for American supermarkets. In Indonesia, cookie factory workers hauled dough in soiled buckets. In China, seafood processors slid crawfish along cracked, stained conveyor belts. Investigators have reported crawling insects, dripping pipes, and fake testing data purporting to show food products were pathogen free.Read full article Comments",

Aside from its strategic military position, the island is famous for its massive annual crab migration, where over 100 million of red crabs make their way across the island to spawn in the ocean. That’s notable because the tech giant has applied for environmental approvals to build a subsea cable connecting the 135-square-kilometer island to Darwin, where US Marines are stationed for six months each year. The project follows a three-year cloud agreement Google signed with Australia’s military in July 2025, but many details about the new facility’s size, cost, and specific capabilities remain “secret,” according to Reuters.

Because we don’t live in the post-money utopian society of the 24th century, the kit will cost you, and unfortunately, it’s priced well into the for-superfans-only zone. The 3,600-piece starship and collection of minifigs will run you $400 when the set officially leaves spacedock on November 28. Though the Enterprise-D is far from our favorite Enterprise, it does make sense as a starting point for the Lego Group. The Next Generation‘s seven-year run in the late ’80s and early ’90s represents a creative and cultural peak for the franchise, and a 2010s-era remaster that painstakingly re-scanned and upgraded all of the original footage and effects for high-definition TVs has kept the old episodes looking fresher than other ’90s Trek shows like Deep Space Nine and Voyager.Read full article Comments",

One of the samples, for instance, tracked under the name PromptLock, was part of an academic study analyzing how effective the use of large language models can be “to autonomously plan, adapt, and execute the ransomware attack lifecycle.” The researchers, however, reported the malware had “clear limitations: it omits persistence, lateral movement, and advanced evasion tactics” and served as little more than a demonstration of the feasibility of AI for such purposes. Prior to the paper’s release, security firm ESET said it had discovered the sample and hailed it as “the first AI-powered ransomware.” Don’t believe the hype Like the other four samples Google analyzed—FruitShell, PromptFlux, PromptSteal, and QuietVault—PromptLock was easy to detect, even by less-sophisticated endpoint protections that rely on static signatures. All samples also employed previously seen methods in malware samples, making them easy to counteract. They also had no operational impact, meaning they didn’t require defenders to adopt new defenses.Read full article Comments",

Losses in court left Google to make sweeping changes to the Play Store, but Google appeared poised to take the case all the way to the Supreme Court. That is unlikely now that Epic and Google have reached a settlement in the case. It still needs to be approved by the judge, but the agreement provides a framework for long-term changes to Android app distribution that would apply globally. Late last month, Google was forced to make the first round of mandated changes to the Play Store to comply with the court’s ruling. It grudgingly began allowing developers to direct users to alternative payment options and app downloads outside of Google’s ecosystem. By next summer, Google was supposed to open up Android to third-party app stores in a big way. These changes were only mandated for three years and in the United States. The new agreement includes a different vision for third-party stores on Android—one that Google finds more palatable and that still gives Epic what it wants. If approved, the settlement will lower Google’s standard fee for developers. There will also be new support in Android for third-party app stores that will reduce the friction of leaving the Google bubble. Under the terms of the settlement, Google will support these changes through at least June 2032.Read full article Comments",

After the “sticks” were deployed, a “carrot” was offered. Penn became one of just nine schools nationally to be offered a special “compact” with the federal government, which would give the feds broad control over the school and its speech in return for preferential access to federal funds. Penn declined to sign the deal. (Making the whole surreal situation stranger was the fact that one of Penn’s own wealthy boosters apparently helped the Trump administration write the compact.) In other words, Penn has become an obvious target of the Trump administration; now it has been targeted by a hacker claiming to share Trump and Musk’s grievances over affirmative action and “wokeness.”Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Syphilis can be a tricky disease to diagnose—especially when a patient may not be sharing the whole story. Doctors in Belgium met with a real head-scratcher when an 83-year-old married man came in with a rare form of secondary syphilis—the second of four stages of the sexually transmitted bacterial infection that has been called a “master of disguise.” The man told doctors up front that he was in a monogamous 50-year-long marriage and had been sexually inactive in recent years following treatment for cancer. In a Clinical Problem-Solving report published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, doctors laid out the step-by-step tests and reasoning they used to get to the right diagnosis, which still didn’t answer all their questions.Read full article Comments",

If adopted, the rule change would allow DHS agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), to broadly collect facial imagery, finger and palm prints, iris scans, and voice prints. They may also request DNA, which DHS claimed “would only be collected in limited circumstances,” like to verify family relations. These updates would cost taxpayers $288.7 million annually, DHS estimated, including $57.1 million for DNA collection alone. Annual individual charges to immigrants submitting data will likely be similarly high, estimated at around $231.5 million. Costs could be higher, DHS admitted, especially if DNA testing is conducted more widely than projected.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Quantum computers based on ions or atoms have one major advantage: The qubits themselves aren’t manufactured, and there’s no device-to-device among atoms. Every atom is the same and should perform similarly every time. And since the qubits themselves can be moved around, it’s theoretically possible to entangle any atom or ion with any other in the system, allowing for a lot of flexibility in how algorithms and error correction are performed. This combination of consistent, high-fidelity performance with all-to-all connectivity has led many key demonstrations of quantum computing to be done on trapped-ion hardware. Unfortunately, the hardware has been held back a bit by relatively low qubit counts—a few dozen compared to the hundred or more seen in other technologies. But on Wednesday, a company called Quantinuum announced a new version of its trapped-ion hardware that significantly boosts the qubit count and uses some interesting technology to manage their operation. Trapped-ion computing Both neutral atom and trapped-ion computers store their qubits in the spin of the nucleus. That spin is somewhat shielded from the environment by the cloud of electrons around the nucleus, giving these qubits a relatively long coherence time. While neutral atoms are held in place by a network of lasers, trapped ions are manipulated via electromagnetic control based on the ion’s charge. This means that key components of the hardware can be built using standard electronic manufacturing, although lasers are still needed for manipulations and readout.Read full article Comments",

In addition to reducing access to popular live content, the corporate conflict is highlighting another frustration in the streaming era. As Google and Disney continue duking it out, their customers have lost some access to content they thought was permanent: DVR files and digital movie purchases. A perk of subscribing to YouTube TV, per Google’s marketing, is the ability to “record it all with unlimited DVR space.” A footnote on the YouTube TV homepage notes that unlimited DVR is subject to “device, regional, and Internet restrictions” but overlooks an additional restriction in the form of multi-conglomerate spats.Read full article Comments",

Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), called for a federal investigation, alleging that Flock has been “negligently handling Americans’ personal data” by failing to use cybersecurity best practices.
