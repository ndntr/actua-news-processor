          "content": "When The Rocky Horror Picture Show premiered in 1975, no one could have dreamed that it would become the longest-running theatrical release film in history. But that's what happened. Thanks to a killer soundtrack, campy humor, and a devoted cult following, Rocky Horror is still a mainstay of midnight movie culture. In honor of its 50th anniversary, Disney/20th Century Studios is releasing a newly restored 4K HDR version in October, along with deluxe special editions on DVD and Blu-ray. And the film has inspired not one, but two documentaries marking its five decades of existence: Strange Journey: The Story of Rocky Horror and Sane Inside Insanity: The Phenomenon of Rocky Horror. (Spoilers below, because it's been 50 years.) The film is an adaption of Richard O'Brien's 1973 musical for the stage, The Rocky Horror Show. At the time, he was a struggling actor and wrote the musical as an homage to the science fiction and B horror movies he'd loved since a child. In fact, the opening song (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature\") makes explicit reference to many of those, including 1951's The Day the Earth Stood Still, Flash Gordon (1936), King Kong (1933), The Invisible Man (1933), Forbidden Planet (1956), and The Day of the Triffids (1962), among others.Read full article Comments",

For scientists, that has long posed a problem: According to physicists’ best current theories, matter and its counterpart, antimatter, ought to have been created in equal amounts at the time of the Big Bang. But antimatter is vanishingly rare in the universe. So what happened? Physicists don’t know the answer to that question yet, but many think the solution must involve some subtle difference in the way that matter and antimatter behave. And right now, the most promising path into that unexplored territory centers on new experiments involving the mysterious subatomic particle known as the neutrino. “It’s not to say that neutrinos are definitely the explanation of the matter-antimatter asymmetry, but a very large class of models that can explain this asymmetry are connected to neutrinos,” says Jessica Turner, a theoretical physicist at Durham University in the United Kingdom.Read full article Comments",

This determination is based on sustained winds, which were measured by a US Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft on Saturday at 160 mph. There is some good news: Erin is threading a needle with its projected track. Although it should pass close to several landmasses between now and next Thursday, Erin should remain far enough away to avoid catastrophic damage. Erin is presently passing to the north of the Caribbean islands, and will turn northward before reaching the Bahamas and the Eastern United States.

The user revolt got so bad that OpenAI brought back the previous GPT-4o model as an option in an attempt to calm things down. To see just how much the new model changed things, we decided to put both GPT-5 and GPT-4o through our own gauntlet of test prompts. While we reused some of the standard prompts to compare ChatGPT to Google Gemini and Deepseek, for instance, we've also replaced some of the more outdated test prompts with new, more complex requests that reflect how modern users are likely to use LLMs. These eight prompts are obviously far from a rigorous evaluation of everything LLMs can do, and judging the responses obviously involves some level of subjectivity. Still, we think this set of prompts and responses gives a fun overview of the kinds of differences in style and substance you might find if you decide to use OpenAI's older model instead of its newest.Read full article Comments",

Created in 2019, the specification had languished in relative obscurity for years because the cheap, plentiful non-Express microSD cards were generally fast enough for the things that people were using them for, and because most hardware didn't support microSD Express cards in the first place. However, Nintendo's console needed performance closer to that of an internal SSD to run games, given that the more powerful Switch 2 can run more of the titles being developed for SSD-equipped systems such as the PlayStation 5, the Xbox Series S and X, and the PC. And now other companies are trying to push the \"fast, removable storage\" envelope even further. The Verge reports that a Chinese company called Biwin has developed the \"Mini SSD,\" a 15 by 17 mm-thick card that supports read speeds of up to 3,700MB per second due to a two-lane PCI Express 4.0 interface. The current microSD Express standard can support roughly the same peak speeds when connected to two PCIe 4.0 lanes. But in reality, most of today's cards top out around 900MB per second, roughly the amount of bandwidth available from a single PCI Express 3.0 lane.Read full article Comments",

Kennedy Jr. is reviving a long-defunct federal vaccine panel that anti-vaccine advocates, including Kennedy, have long sought and health experts fear will be used to dismantle evidence-based recommendations for life-saving childhood shots. The panel is a task force outlined in the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which is best known for setting up the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The law states that the task force's goal is to \"promote the development of childhood vaccines that result in fewer and less serious adverse reactions than those vaccines on the market on the effective date of this part and promote the refinement of such vaccines.\" The federal government has multiple overlapping procedures and systems that evaluate, review, and continuously monitor the safety of childhood vaccines, which have gone through rigorous testing and are well-established to be safe. Further, the government does, in effect, promote improved vaccines by providing grants to academic and industry researchers to develop advanced shots. It also conducts its own vaccine research toward that goal. For instance, researchers at the National Institutes of Health were critical in developing the mRNA vaccine technology that enabled the swift creation of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines that saved millions of lives at the height of the pandemic.Read full article Comments",

These talks have only just begun—with Intel branding them a rumor—and sources told the WSJ that Trump has yet to iron out how the potential arrangement might work. The WSJ's report comes after Trump called for Tan to \"resign immediately\" last week. Trump's demand was seemingly spurred by a letter that Republican senator Tom Cotton sent to Intel, accusing Tan of having \"concerning\" ties to the Chinese Communist Party.Read full article Comments",

Nevertheless, Duffy is putting his imprint on the space agency, seeking to emphasize the agency's human exploration plans, including the development of a lunar base, and ending NASA's efforts to study planet Earth and its changing climate.Read full article Comments",

The automaker has used this year's Monterey Car Week as a stage to show off a bright yellow prototype—the color is called Propulsion Yellow Pearl—ahead of the production car going on sale next year. And unlike the current generation (which Ars last tested in 2019) RDX, this crossover will be fully electric. It will be built at the Honda Marysville Auto Plant that we checked out in January. The 40-year-old factory has undergone a high-tech refit that has not only made the factory more energy efficient and a better working environment for employees but also prepared it to incorporate electric vehicles into the assembly line. In recent years, Acura has grappled with its self-image. Although it's often perceived as a luxury brand, Acura has always been more of a North American performance arm of Honda, and the automaker wants to lean into that. Unlike the brand's first battery electric vehicle the ZDX, which is a rebadged General Motors EV, the RSX was designed entirely in-house.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Welcome to Edition 8.06 of the Rocket Report! Two of the world's most storied rocket builders not named SpaceX achieved major successes this week. Arianespace's Ariane 6 rocket launched from French Guiana on its third flight Tuesday night with a European weather satellite. Less than 20 minutes later, United Launch Alliance's third Vulcan rocket lifted off from Florida on a US military mission. These are two of the three big rockets developed in the Western world that have made their orbital debuts in the last two years, alongside Blue Origin's New Glenn launcher. Ariane 6 narrowly won the \"race\" to reach its third orbital flight, but if you look at it another way, Ariane 6 reached its third flight milestone 13 months after its inaugural launch. It took Vulcan more than 19 months, and New Glenn has flown just once. SpaceX's Super Heavy/Starship rocket has flown nine times but has yet to reach orbit. As always, we welcome reader submissions.

Sixth success for sea-launched Chinese rocket. Private Chinese satellite operator Geespace added 11 spacecraft to its expanding Internet of Things constellation on August 8, aiming to boost low-power connectivity in key emerging markets, Space News reports. The 11 satellites rode into orbit aboard a solid-fueled Jielong 3 (Smart Dragon 3) rocket lifting off from an ocean platform in the Yellow Sea off the coast of Rizhao, a city in eastern China's Shandong province. This was the sixth flight of the Jielong 3, a rocket developed by a commercially oriented spinoff of the state-owned China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.Read full article Comments",
