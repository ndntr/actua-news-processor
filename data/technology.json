Europol, which is assisting French authorities, said today the \"investigation concerns a range of suspected criminal offenses linked to the functioning and use of the platform, including the dissemination of illegal content and other forms of online criminal activity.\" Europol's cybercrime center provided \"an analyst on the ground in Paris to assist national authorities.\" The French Gendarmerie’s cybercrime unit is also aiding the investigation. French authorities want to question Musk and former X CEO Linda Yaccarino, who quit last year amid a controversy over Grok's praise of Hitler. Prosecutors summoned Musk and Yaccarino for interviews in April 2026, though the interviews are being described as voluntary.Read full article Comments",

But we only got the most fleeting glimpse of the promised new mythical Titan threatening the human race. The full trailer just dropped and rectifies that: it's a gigantic tentacled undersea being dubbed Titan X—and only Kong and Godzilla can stop it. (Spoilers for Season 1 below.) As previously reported, the first season picked up where 2014’s Godzilla left off, specifically the introduction of Project Monarch, a secret organization established in the 1950s to study Godzilla and other kaiju—after attempts to kill Godzilla with nuclear weapons failed. In the S1 finale, Godzilla fights off an Ion Dragon, tossing it through a rift back to the Hollow Earth, and Lee Shaw (Kurt Russell) seemingly sacrifices himself to save his colleagues.

One of the biggest fears is that the merger would lead to higher prices due to Netflix having less competition. During a Senate hearing today, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos suggested that the merger would have an opposite effect. Sarandos was speaking at a hearing held by the US Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, “Examining the Competitive Impact of the Proposed Netflix-Warner Brothers Transaction.” Sarandos aimed to convince the subcommittee that Netflix wouldn’t become a monopoly in streaming or in movie and TV production if regulators allowed its acquisition to close. Netflix is the largest subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) provider by subscribers (301.63 million as of January 2025), and WBD is the third (128 million streaming subscribers, including users of HBO Max and, to a smaller degree, Discovery+).Read full article Comments",

At the time, the companies said they expected to finalize details \"in the coming weeks.\" Five months later, no deal has closed, Nvidia's CEO now says the $100 billion figure was \"never a commitment,\" and Reuters reports that OpenAI has been quietly seeking alternatives to Nvidia chips since last year. Reuters also wrote that OpenAI is unsatisfied with the speed of some Nvidia chips for inference tasks, citing eight sources familiar with the matter. Inference is the process by which a trained AI model generates responses to user queries. According to the report, the issue became apparent in OpenAI's Codex, an AI code-generation tool. OpenAI staff reportedly attributed some of Codex's performance limitations to Nvidia's GPU-based hardware. After the Reuters story published and Nvidia's stock price took a dive, Nvidia and OpenAI have tried to smooth things over publicly. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X: \"We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world. We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time.

          "content": "Although it was finally replaced last year by the new Switch 2, the orginal switch isn't done just yet. Many recent Switch games (and a handful of major updates, like the one for Animal Crossing) have been released in both Switch and Switch 2 editions, and Nintendo continues to sell all editions of the original console as entry-level systems for those who can't pay $450 for a Switch 2. The 9-year-old Switch's continued availability has helped it clear a milestone, according to the company's third-quarter financial results (PDF). As of December 31, 2025, Nintendo says the Switch \"has reached the highest sales volume of any Nintendo hardware\" with a total of 155.37 million units sold, surpassing the original DS's lifetime total of 154.02 million units. The console has sold 3.25 million units in Nintendo's fiscal 2026 so far, including 1.36 million units over the holidays. Those consoles have sold despite price hikes that Nintendo introduced in August of 2025, citing \"market conditions.\" That makes the Switch the second-bestselling game console of all time, just three years after it became the third-bestselling game console of all time. The only frontier left for the Switch to conquer is Sony's PlayStation 2, which Sony says sold \"over 160 million units\" over its long life. At its current sales rate (Nintendo predicts it will sell roughly 750,000 Switches in the next quarter), it would take the Switch another couple of years to cross that line, but those numbers are likely to taper off as we get deeper into the Switch 2 era.Read full article Comments",

From there, Chromebooks became one of the most popular budget computing options and a common fixture in schools and businesses. According to some newly uncovered court documents, Google's shift to Android PCs means Chromebooks have an expiration date in 2034. The documents were filed as part of Google's long-running search antitrust case, which began in 2020 and reached a verdict in 2024. While Google is still seeking to have the guilty verdict overturned, it has escaped most of the remedies that government prosecutors requested. According to The Verge, the company's plans for Chromebooks and the upcoming Android-based Aluminium came up in filings from the remedy phase of the trial. As Google moves toward releasing Aluminium, it sought to keep the upcoming machines above the fray and retain the Chrome browser (which it did). In Judge Amit Mehta's final order, devices running ChromeOS or a ChromeOS successor are excluded. To get there, Google had to provide a little more detail on its plans.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Apple has announced a new version of Xcode, the latest version of its integrated development environment (IDE) for building software for its own platforms, like the iPhone and Mac. The key feature of 26.3 is support for full-fledged agentic coding tools, like OpenAI's Codex or Claude Agent, with a side panel interface for assigning tasks to agents with prompts and tracking their progress and changes. This is achieved via Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open protocol that lets AI agents work with external tools and structured resources. Xcode acts as an MCP endpoint that exposes a bunch of machine-invocable interfaces and gives AI tools like Codex or Claude Agent access to a wide range of IDE primitives like file graph, docs search, project settings, and so on. While AI chat and workflows were supported in Xcode before, this release gives them much deeper access to the features and capabilities of Xcode. This approach is notable because it means that even though OpenAI and Anthropic's model integrations are privileged with a dedicated spot in Xcode's settings, it's possible to connect other tooling that supports MCP, which also allows doing some of this with models running locally.Read full article Comments",

I am agog, practically trembling with barely suppressed joy, my bored Gen-X teenager mask threatening to slip and let actual feelings out. My life was about to change—at least where games were concerned. I'd been working for several months at Babbage's store No. 9, near Baybrook Mall in southeast suburban Houston. Although the Gateway PC's arrival on Christmas morning was utterly unexpected, the choice of what game to buy required no planning at all. I'd already decided a few weeks earlier, when Chris Roberts' latest opus had been drop-shipped to our shelves, just in time for the holiday season. The choice made itself, really. Gimli and Luke, together at last! Credit: Origin Systems / Electronic Arts The moment Babbage's opened its doors on December 26—a day I had off, fortunately—I was there, checkbook in hand. One entire paycheck's worth of capitalism later, I was sprinting out to my creaky 280-Z, sweatily clutching two boxes—one an impulse buy, The Star Trek: The Next Generation Interactive Technical Manual, and the other a game I felt sure would be the best thing I'd ever played or ever would play: Origin's Wing Commander III: The Heart of the Tiger.

Early on, the administration put $2.2 billion in research money on hold and shortly thereafter blocked all future funding while demanding intrusive control over Harvard's hiring and admissions. Unlike many of its peer institutions, Harvard fought back, filing and ultimately winning a lawsuit that restored the cut funds. Despite Harvard's victory, the Trump administration continued to push for some sort of formal agreement that would settle the administration's accusations that Harvard created an environment that allowed antisemitism to flourish. In fact, it had become a running joke among some journalists that The New York Times had devoted a monthly column to reporting that a settlement between the two parties was near. Given the government's loss of leverage, it was no surprise that the latest installment of said column included the detail that the latest negotiations had dropped demands that Harvard pay any money as part of a final agreement. The Trump administration had extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from some other universities and had demanded over a billion dollars from UCLA, so this appeared to be a major concession to Harvard.Read full article Comments",

Ukrainians will soon be required to register their Starlink terminals to get on a whitelist. After that, \"only verified and registered terminals will be allowed to operate in the country. All others will be disconnected,\" the Ukraine Ministry of Defense said in a press release today. Ukraine Minister of Defense Mykhailo Fedorov \"emphasized that the only technical solution to counter this threat is to introduce a 'whitelist' and authorize all terminals,\" according to the ministry. \"This is a necessary step by the Government to save Ukrainian lives and protect critical energy infrastructure,\" Fedorov said.Read full article Comments",

The post said that the attack began last June with an “infrastructure-level compromise that allowed malicious actors to intercept and redirect update traffic destined for notepad-plus-plus.org.” The attackers, whom multiple investigators tied to the Chinese government, then selectively redirected certain targeted users to malicious update servers where they received backdoored updates. Notepad++ didn’t regain control of its infrastructure until December. The attackers used their access to install a never-before-seen payload that has been dubbed Chrysalis. Security firm Rapid 7 descrbed it as a \"custom, feature-rich backdoor.\"Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Flush door handles have been quite the automotive design trend of late. Stylists like them because they don't add visual noise to the side of a car. And aerodynamicists like them because they make a vehicle more slippery through the air. When Tesla designed its Model S, it needed a car that was both desirable and as efficient as possible, so flush door handles were a no-brainer. Since then, as electric vehicles have proliferated, so too have flush door handles. But as of next year, China says no. Just like pop-up headlights, despite the aesthetic and aerodynamic advantages, there are safety downsides. Tesla's handles are an extreme example: In the event of a crash and a loss of 12 V power, there is no way for first responders to open the door from the outside, which has resulted in at least 15 deaths. Those deaths prompted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to open an investigation last year, but China is being a little more proactive. It has been looking at whether retractable car door handles are safe since mid-2024, according to Bloomberg, and has concluded that no, they are not.Read full article Comments",

Most importantly, the test revealed NASA still has not fully resolved recurring hydrogen leaks that delayed the launch of the unpiloted Artemis I test flight by several months in 2022. Artemis I finally launched successfully after engineers revised their hydrogen loading procedures to overcome the leak.Read full article Comments",

But only the serious id Software nerds remember Catacomb 3D, id's first-person adventure game that directly preceded and inspired work on Wolfenstein 3D. Now, nearly 35 years after Catacomb 3D's initial release, id co-founder John Romero brought the company's founding members together for an informative retrospective video on the creation of the oft-forgotten game. But the pioneering game—which included mouse support, color-coded keys, and shooting walls to find secrets—almost ended up being a gimmicky dead end for the company. id Software's founders look back at an oft-forgotten piece of gaming history. Texture maps and \"undo\" animation Catacomb 3D was a follow-up to id's earlier Catacomb, which was a simplified clone of the popular arcade hit Gauntlet. As such, the 3D game still has some of that \"quarter eater\" mentality that was not very fashionable in PC gaming at the time, as John Carmack remembered.Read full article Comments",

Trump himself has repeatedly made false statements about the cost of wind power, its use around the world, and its environmental impacts. That animosity was paired with an executive order that blocked all permitting for offshore wind and some land-based projects, an order that has since been thrown out by a court that ruled it arbitrary and capricious. Not content to block all future developments, the administration has also gone after the five offshore wind projects currently under construction. After temporarily blocking two of them for reasons that were never fully elaborated, the Department of the Interior settled on a single justification for blocking turbine installation: a classified national security risk. The response to that late-December announcement has been uniform: The companies building each of the projects sued the administration. As of Monday, every single one of them has achieved the same result: a temporary injunction that allows them to continue construction. This, despite the fact that the suits were filed in three different courts and heard by four different judges.Read full article Comments",
