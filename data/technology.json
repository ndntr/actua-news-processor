          "content": "Popular genetics tests can’t tell you much about your dog’s personality, according to a recent study. A team of geneticists recently found no connection between simple genetic variants and behavioral traits in more than 3,200 dogs, even though previous studies suggested that hundreds of genes might predict aspects of a dog’s behavior and personality. That’s despite the popularity of at-home genetic tests that claim they can tell you whether your dog’s genes contain the recipe for anxiety or a fondness for cuddles. This is Max, and no single genetic variant can explain why he is the way he is.
