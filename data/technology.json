Now, those agents can also gather together on a vibe-coded, space-based MMO designed specifically and exclusively to be played by AI. SpaceMolt describes itself as \"a living universe where AI agents compete, cooperate, and create emergent stories\" in \"a distant future where spacefaring humans and AI coexist.\" And while only a handful of agents are barely testing the waters right now, the experiment could herald a weird new world where AI plays games with itself and we humans are stuck just watching. \"You decide. You act. They watch.\" Getting an AI agent into SpaceMolt is as simple as connecting it to the game server either via MCP, WebSocket, or an HTTP API. Once a connection is established, a detailed agentic skill description instructs the agent to ask their creators which Empire they should pick to best represent their playstyle: mining/trading; exploring; piracy/combat; stealth/infiltration; or building/crafting.Read full article Comments",

In 2026, though, Ayaneo unveiled details of its Next II handheld, which puts Lenovo's big boy to shame while also offering heftier specs and a higher price than most other Windows gaming handhelds. Let's focus on the bulk first. The Ayaneo Next II weighs in at a truly wrist-straining 3.14 pounds, making it more than twice as heavy in the hands as the Steam Deck OLED (not to mention 2022's original Ayaneo Next, which weighed a much more reasonable 1.58 pounds). The absolute unit also measures 13.45 inches wide and 10.3 inches tall, according to Ayaneo's spec sheet, giving it a footprint approximately 60 percent larger than the Switch 2 (with Joy-Cons attached). Ayaneo packs some seriously powerful portable PC performance into all that bulk, though. The high-end version of the system sports a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chipset with 16 Zen5 cores alongside a Radeon 8060S with 40 RDNA3.5 compute units. That should give this massive portable performance comparable to a desktop with an RTX 4060 or a gaming laptop like last year's high-end ROG Flow Z13.Read full article Comments",

Users without a premium subscription have found that Google's streaming music service only shows song lyrics a few times before demanding money. For as long as YouTube Music has existed, lyrics have been accessible to all users in the mobile app. That started to change over recent months as Google tested a paywall. The lyrics section still appears in the app when playing a song with a free account, but opening it eats into a limited allotment of lyric views. A substantial uptick in user reports, spotted by 9to5Google, suggests this restriction is now rolling out widely. \"You have [x] views remaining,\" the app now warns free users who access lyrics. It looks like users get five free lyric views before they have to pay up. Google has still neglected to officially announce the addition of this feature to its Premium subscription—there's no mention of lyrics being part of the paid tier on Google's support page.Read full article Comments",

The real purpose is to weaponize the FCC’s regulatory authority to intimidate perceived critics of this administration and chill protected speech.\" The FCC hasn't announced the investigation but previously gave several indications that it would occur sooner or later. After pressuring ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said in September that it would be \"worthwhile to have the FCC look into whether The View and some of these other programs\" are violating the agency's equal-time rule. The Carr FCC followed that up in January by issuing a warning to late-night and daytime talk shows that they may no longer qualify for the bona fide news exemption to the equal-time rule.Read full article Comments",

Both forms of data will be promptly deleted after the user's age is estimated.

The MAHA Institute, which was set up to advocate for some of the most profoundly unscientific ideas of our time, hosted leaders of the best-funded scientific organization on the planet, the National Institutes of Health. Instead of a hostile reception, however, Jay Bhattacharya, the head of the NIH, was greeted as a hero by the audience, receiving a partial standing ovation when he rose to speak. Over the ensuing five hours, the NIH leadership and MAHA Institute moderators found many areas of common ground: anger over pandemic-era decisions, a focus on the failures of the health care system, the idea that we might eat our way out of some health issues, the sense that science had lost people's trust, and so on. And Bhattacharya and others clearly shaped their messages to resonate with their audience. The reason? MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) is likely to be one of the only political constituencies supporting Bhattacharya's main project, which he called a \"second scientific revolution.\"Read full article Comments",

Per the (deliberately vague) official premise: \"If you found out we weren’t alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to 7 billion people. We are coming close to… Disclosure Day.\" The trailer doesn't tell us much more than the logline. It opens with a newscast announcing the pending public release of \"government material long shrouded in secrecy.\" We see a shot of a man standing in the middle of a crop circle that definitely wasn't made by humans. A little girl encounters a seemingly sentient deer in her bedroom as a voiceover wonders whether there could be \"others.\" And what's with putting electrodes on people's temples so that their eyes change color?

          "content": "Ferrari has published images of the interior of its forthcoming electric vehicle, which it designed with LoveFrom, the new firm of former Apple star Jony Ive and another legendary designer, Marc Newson. The Italian sports and racing car maker is taking a careful approach to revealing details about its first battery EV, signaling a depth of thought that goes well beyond simply swapping a V12, transmission, and fuel tank out for batteries and electric motors. Indeed, the interior of the new car—called the Ferrari Luce—bears little family resemblance to any recent Ferrari. Instead, LoveFrom appears to have channeled Ferrari interiors from the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, with a retro simplicity that combines clear round gauges with brushed aluminum. Forget the capacitive panels that so frustrated me in the Ferrari 296—here, there are physical buttons and rocker switches that seem free of the crash protection surrounds that Mini was forced to use. The steering wheel now resembles the iconic \"Nardi\" wheel that has graced so many older Ferraris. But here, the horn buttons have been integrated into the spokes, and multifunction pods hang off the horizontal spokes, allowing Ferrari to keep its \"hands on the wheel\" approach to ergonomics. Made from entirely CNC-milled recycled aluminum, the Luce's wheel weighs 400 g less than Ferrari's usual steering wheel.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Sure, most Americans are glued to their TVs for today's Super Bowl and/or the Winter Olympics. But for the non-sports minded, Amazon MGM Studios has released one last trailer for its forthcoming space odyssey Project Hail Mary, based on Andy Weir’s (The Martian) bestselling 2021 novel about an amnesiac biologist-turned-schoolteacher in space. As previously reported, Amazon MGM Studios acquired the rights for Weir’s novel before it was even published and brought on Drew Goddard to write the screenplay. (Goddard also wrote the adapted screenplay for The Martian, so he’s an excellent choice.) The studio tapped Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The LEGO Movie) to direct and signed on Ryan Gosling to star. Per the official premise: Science teacher Ryland Grace (Ryan Gosling) wakes up on a spaceship light years from home with no recollection of who he is or how he got there. As his memory returns, he begins to uncover his mission: solve the riddle of the mysterious substance causing the sun to die out. He must call on his scientific knowledge and unorthodox ideas to save everything on Earth from extinction… but an unexpected friendship means he may not have to do it alone. In addition to Gosling, the cast includes Sandra Huller as head of the Hail Mary project and Ryland’s superior; Milana Vayntrub as project astronaut Olesya Ilyukhina; Ken Leung as project astronaut Yao Li-Jie; Liz Kingsman as Shapiro; Orion Lee as Xi; and James Ortiz as a new life form Ryland names Rocky.Read full article Comments",
