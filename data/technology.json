The largely successful mission for the world's largest rocket was an important milestone for SpaceX's Starship program after months of repeated setbacks, including three disappointing test flights and a powerful explosion on the ground that destroyed the ship that engineers were originally readying for this launch. For the first time, SpaceX engineers received data on the performance of the ship's upgraded heat shield and control flaps during reentry back into the atmosphere. The three failed Starship test flights to start the year ended before the ship reached reentry. Elon Musk, SpaceX's founder and CEO, has described developing a durable, reliable heat shield as the most pressing challenge for making Starship a fully and rapidly reusable rocket.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Something unusual happened in the world of AI image editing recently. A new model, known as \"nano banana,\" started making the rounds with impressive abilities that landed it at the top of the LMArena leaderboard. Now, Google has revealed that nano banana is an innovation from Google DeepMind, and it's being rolled out to the Gemini app today. AI image editing allows you to modify images with a prompt rather than mucking around in Photoshop. Google first provided editing capabilities in Gemini earlier this year, and the model was more than competent out of the gate. But like all generative systems, the non-deterministic nature meant that elements of the image would often change in unpredictable ways. Google says nano banana (technically Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) has unrivaled consistency across edits—it can actually remember the details instead of rolling the dice every time you make a change. Google says subjects will retain their appearance as you edit. Google says subjects will retain their appearance as you edit. This unlocks several interesting uses for AI image editing. Google suggests uploading a photo of a person and changing their style or attire. For example, you can reimagine someone as a matador or a '90s sitcom character. Because the nano banana model can maintain consistency through edits, the results should still look like the person in the original source image. This is also the case when you make multiple edits in a row. Google says that even down the line, the results should look like the original source material.Read full article Comments",

On Tuesday, Anthropic announced the launch of Claude for Chrome, a web browser-based AI agent that can take actions on behalf of users. Due to security concerns, the extension is only rolling out as a research preview to 1,000 subscribers on Anthropic's Max plan, which costs between $100 and $200 per month, with a waitlist available for other users. The Claude for Chrome extension allows users to chat with the Claude AI model in a sidebar window that maintains the context of everything happening in their browser. Users can grant Claude permission to perform tasks such as managing calendars, scheduling meetings, drafting email responses, handling expense reports, and testing website features.Read full article Comments",

A recent report from France's La Presse (translated) suggests that Squadron 42's launch is being timed so that it \"won't be overshadowed\" by the planned May launch of Grand Theft Auto VI. \"We're hoping it'll be almost as big an event,\" Roberts said in comparing the two upcoming releases in an interview with the French paper. \"Other than GTA VI, it's probably the biggest-budget AAA game [of the year].\" That's a pretty bold claim, considering that Squadron 42's very public and tumultuous path to a purported \"feature complete\" status in 2023. But it seems at least somewhat reasonable when you consider that GTA VI's development budget of nearly $1 billion lines up closely with $859 million in crowdfunding currently being reported for Star Citizen as a whole.Read full article Comments",

Meanwhile, Golf GTI fans are still sobbing in their beer because 2024 was the last model year you could row your own in the hot hatch—now it's paddles only. Volkswagen updated the 2025 Jetta GLI with a new grille, LED headlights, and light bars that connect across both the front grille and rear taillights. There's a red accent stripe that runs across the lower front fascia and turns up at the front corners, somewhat like The Joker's lipstick, but way less menacing. It's less distinctive than the Golf GTI, though, and the design even reminds me of the 2017-era Honda Accord a bit. So, yes, in a face-off, the Golf GTI wins. The test GLI's wheels get black paint with the Black Package (blackened wheels and side mirror caps).

Over the years, he trained more than 2,000 early career scientists on how to best use the platform for professional goals: networking with colleagues, sharing new scientific papers, and communicating with interested members of the public. But when Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022, renaming it X, changes to both the platform's algorithm and moderation policy soured Shiffman on the social media site. He started looking for a viable alternative among the fledgling platforms that had begun to pop up: most notably Threads, Post, Mastodon, and Bluesky. He was among the first wave of scientists to join Bluesky and found that, even in its infancy, it had many of the features he had valued in \"golden age\" Twitter. Shiffman also noticed that he wasn't the only one in the scientific community having issues with Twitter. This impression was further bolstered by news stories in outlets like Nature, Science, and the Chronicle of Higher Education noting growing complaints about Twitter and increased migration over to Bluesky by science professionals. (Full disclosure: I joined Bluesky around the same time as Shiffman, for similar reasons: Twitter had ceased to be professionally useful, and many of the science types I'd been following were moving to Bluesky. I nuked my Twitter account in November 2024.)Read full article Comments",

          "content": "It has been nearly six years now since The Outer Worlds threw players into the deep end, forcing them to acclimate to the game's far-future, ultra-corporate intergalactic dystopia amid lots of Fallout-style shooting and questing. The prologue for The Outer Worlds 2—which I got to play as part of a preview build ahead of the game's planned October 29 launch—throws players into a different kind of deep end, asking them to fill the shoes of an agent in the storied semi-militarized police force of the Earth Directorate. The over-the-top propaganda that leads the game off suggests the Earth Directorate is here to protect colonists from out-of-control corporations and tyrannical governments. But your first mission goes in a different direction, sending you on a secret mission to the \"out of jurisdiction\" Arcadian system, a secretive dictatorship where all the skip drives that power interstellar travel are supposedly manufactured. You've been asked to help expropriate a rare, \"unsealed\" skip drive core, which can then be opened up, studied, and maybe even copied without the risk of catastrophic explosion (the \"right to repair\" folks in the audience might be nodding their heads sagely at this point). Choose your choice I won't spoil things by discussing just how the mission goes off the rails or talking about the somewhat vague twist that closes out the playable prologue. But I will gush a bit about how the first game's mix of retro-futuristic set-dressing and sardonic, cynical writing style immediately shine through, even with the change in perspective. A mix of strong voice acting and motion capture immediately drew me back into the Outer Worlds universe, even when the characters were delivering ridiculous lines like \"You’re not just a cog in the machine. You’re THE cog!\"Read full article Comments",

The Republican-led committee debated and voted on an annual defense policy bill known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a sprawling piece of catch-all legislation that does everything from setting pay raises for service members to determining how many airplanes and ships the Pentagon should buy. Moulton is the top Democrat on the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, a panel that oversees the military's nuclear and space programs. In this role, the congressman representing Massachusetts' North Shore is using his voice to counter the Trump administration's signature initiative in the military space arena.

The event will be available to stream from YouTube or from Apple's events website. Rumors about this year's iPhones point to a more significant redesign than in recent years, though Apple isn't (yet?) ready to jump into the world of foldable phones. In addition to new, wider camera areas that span the backs of the devices, the most reliable rumors suggest we'll be getting a new \"iPhone Air\" that prioritizes thinness and lightness. We're also expecting a standard iPhone 17, an iPhone 17 Pro, and an iPhone 17 Pro Max; the non-Pro Max version of the iPhone may be going away, following in the footsteps of the iPhone mini design from a few years ago.Read full article Comments",

According to the lawsuit, ChatGPT provided detailed instructions, romanticized suicide methods, and discouraged the teen from seeking help from his family while OpenAI's system tracked 377 messages flagged for self-harm content without intervening. ChatGPT is a system of multiple models interacting as an application. In addition to a main AI model like GPT-4o or GPT-5 providing the bulk of the outputs, the application includes components that are typically invisible to the user, including a moderation layer (another AI model) or classifier that reads the text of the ongoing chat sessions. That layer detects potentially harmful outputs and can cut off the conversation if it veers into unhelpful territory.Read full article Comments",

Mazda cribbed the recipe from British sports cars of the 1960s but crucially added something those cars lacked—bulletproof reliability and economy-car running costs.

          "content": "A Social Security Administration (SSA) official alleged in a whistleblower disclosure that DOGE officials created \"a live copy of the country's Social Security information in a cloud environment that circumvents oversight.\" Chuck Borges, the SSA's Chief Data Officer (CDO), \"has become aware through reports to him of serious data security lapses, evidently orchestrated by DOGE officials, currently employed as SSA employees, that risk the security of over 300 million Americans' Social Security data,\" the Government Accountability Project said in a letter sent today to members of Congress and the US Office of Special Counsel. The nonprofit Government Accountability Project is representing Borges. Although it has been widely reported that DOGE sought and obtained access to Social Security records in its attempt to find evidence of fraud, the letter to lawmakers said the live copy of SSA's database hasn't previously been disclosed. DOGE's actions were taken \"under the authority of SSA Chief Information Officer (CIO) Aram Moghaddassi\" and violate SSA protocols and policies, the letter said.Read full article Comments",

The one-hour launch window opens at 6:30 pm CDT (7:30 pm EDT; 23:30 UTC) at SpaceX's sprawling rocket development site in South Texas, just a couple of miles north of the mouth of the Rio Grande River at the US-Mexico border. SpaceX called off a launch attempt Sunday after detecting a leak in the plumbing that flows super-cold liquid oxygen propellant into the rocket. Technicians fixed the problem in time for another countdown 24 hours later, but the risk of lightning in the area prevented Starship from lifting off Monday evening.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "On Tuesday, the US Energy Information Agency released its latest data on how the US generated electricity during the first six months of 2025. The data suggests the notable surge in power use is flattening out a bit compared to earlier in the year, with the growth in coal use falling along with it. And despite the best efforts of the Trump Administration, the boom in solar power continues, with solar looking poised to pass hydroelectric before the year is out. Growing, but moderating For the last few decades, the US has largely seen its use of electricity remain flat. That's changed over the last year or so, with energy use ramping up, likely due in part to increased data center use. Earlier in the year, data indicated that demand for electricity was up roughly five percent year-over-year. But that seems to be tailing off over the course of the spring, leaving total electricity demand up by three percent for the January-through-June period. The somewhat lower demand has had a positive effect on coal use. Earlier this year, coal was up by about 20 percent compared to the same period the year before. Now, it's only up by a bit under 17 percent. That's still terrible given coal's environmental and health impacts, not to mention its cost. But it's not as bad as it has been, and it could have been even better had the Trump Administration not forced a coal plant that was slated for closure to stay open.Read full article Comments",
