          "standfirst": "Anthropic on Tuesday released Claude Sonnet 4.6, a model that amounts to a seismic repricing event for the AI industry. It delivers near-flagship intelligence at mid-tier cost, and it lands squarely in the middle of an unprecedented corporate rush to deploy AI agents and automated coding tools.The model is a full upgrade across coding, computer use, long-context reasoning, agent planning, knowledge work, and design. It features a 1M token context window in beta. It is now the default model in claude.ai and Claude Cowork, and pricing holds steady at $3/$15 per million tokens — the same as its predecessor, Sonnet 4.5.That pricing detail is the headline that matters most. Anthropic&#x27;s flagship Opus models cost $15/$75 per million tokens — five times the Sonnet price. Yet performance that would have previously required reaching for an Opus-class model — including on real-world, economically valuable office tasks — is now available with Sonnet 4.6. For the thousands of enterprises now deploying AI agents that make millions of API calls per day, that math changes everything.Why the cost of running AI agents at scale just dropped dramaticallyTo understand the significance of this release, you need to understand the moment it arrives in. The past year has been dominated by the twin phenomena of \"vibe coding\" and agentic AI. Claude Code — Anthropic&#x27;s developer-facing terminal tool — has become a cultural force in Silicon Valley, with engineers building entire applications through natural-language conversation. The New York Times profiled its meteoric rise in January. The Verge recently declared that Claude Code is having a genuine \"moment.\" OpenAI, meanwhile, has been waging its own offensive with Codex desktop applications and faster inference chips.The result is an industry where AI models are no longer evaluated in isolation. They are evaluated as the engines inside autonomous agents — systems that run for hours, make thousands of tool calls, write and execute code, navigate browsers, and interact with enterprise software. Every dollar spent per million tokens gets multiplied across those thousands of calls. At scale, the difference between $15 and $3 per million input tokens is not incremental. It is transformational.The benchmark table Anthropic released paints a striking picture. On SWE-bench Verified, the industry-standard test for real-world software coding, Sonnet 4.6 scored 79.6% — nearly matching Opus 4.6&#x27;s 80.8%. On agentic computer use (OSWorld-Verified), Sonnet 4.6 scored 72.5%, essentially tied with Opus 4.6&#x27;s 72.7%. On office tasks (GDPval-AA Elo), Sonnet 4.6 actually scored 1633, surpassing Opus 4.6&#x27;s 1606. On agentic financial analysis, Sonnet 4.6 hit 63.3%, beating every model in the comparison, including Opus 4.6 at 60.1%.These are not marginal differences. In many of the categories enterprises care about most, Sonnet 4.6 matches or beats models that cost five times as much to run. An enterprise running an AI agent that processes 10 million tokens per day was previously forced to choose between inferior results at lower cost or superior results at rapidly scaling expense. Sonnet 4.6 largely eliminates that trade-off.In Claude Code, early testing found that users preferred Sonnet 4.6 over Sonnet 4.5 roughly 70% of the time. Users even preferred Sonnet 4.6 to Opus 4.5, Anthropic&#x27;s frontier model from November, 59% of the time. They rated Sonnet 4.6 as significantly less prone to over-engineering and \"laziness,\" and meaningfully better at instruction following. They reported fewer false claims of success, fewer hallucinations, and more consistent follow-through on multi-step tasks.How Claude&#x27;s computer use abilities went from &#x27;experimental&#x27; to near-human in 16 monthsOne of the most dramatic storylines in the release is Anthropic&#x27;s progress on computer use — the ability of an AI to operate a computer the way a human does, clicking a mouse, typing on a keyboard, and navigating software that lacks modern APIs.When Anthropic first introduced this capability in October 2024, the company acknowledged it was \"still experimental — at times cumbersome and error-prone.\" The numbers since then tell a remarkable story: on OSWorld, Claude Sonnet 3.5 scored 14.9% in October 2024. Sonnet 3.7 reached 28.0% in February 2025. Sonnet 4 hit 42.2% by June. Sonnet 4.5 climbed to 61.4% in October. Now Sonnet 4.6 has reached 72.5% — nearly a fivefold improvement in 16 months.This matters because computer use is the capability that unlocks the broadest set of enterprise applications for AI agents. Almost every organization has legacy software — insurance portals, government databases, ERP systems, hospital scheduling tools — that was built before APIs existed. A model that can simply look at a screen and interact with it opens all of these to automation without building bespoke connectors.Jamie Cuffe, CEO of Pace, said Sonnet 4.6 hit 94% on their complex insurance computer use benchmark, the highest of any Claude model tested. \"It reasons through failures and self-corrects in ways we haven&#x27;t seen before,\" Cuffe said in a statement sent to VentureBeat. Will Harvey, co-founder of Convey, called it \"a clear improvement over anything else we&#x27;ve tested in our evals.\"The safety dimension of computer use also got attention. Anthropic noted that computer use poses prompt injection risks — malicious actors hiding instructions on websites to hijack the model — and said its evaluations show Sonnet 4.6 is a major improvement over Sonnet 4.5 in resisting such attacks. For enterprises deploying agents that browse the web and interact with external systems, that hardening is not optional.Enterprise customers say the model closes the gap between Sonnet and Opus pricing tiersThe customer reaction has been unusually specific about cost-performance dynamics. Multiple early testers explicitly described Sonnet 4.6 as eliminating the need to reach for the more expensive Opus tier.Caitlin Colgrove, CTO of Hex Technologies, said the company is moving the majority of its traffic to Sonnet 4.6, noting that with adaptive thinking and high effort, \"we see Opus-level performance on all but our hardest analytical tasks with a more efficient and flexible profile. At Sonnet pricing, it&#x27;s an easy call for our workloads.\"Ben Kus, CTO of Box, said the model outperformed Sonnet 4.5 in heavy reasoning Q&A by 15 percentage points across real enterprise documents. Michele Catasta, President of Replit, called the performance-to-cost ratio \"extraordinary.\" Ryan Wiggins of Mercury Banking put it more bluntly: \"Claude Sonnet 4.6 is faster, cheaper, and more likely to nail things on the first try. That combination was a surprising combination of improvements, and we didn&#x27;t expect to see it at this price point.\"The coding improvements resonate particularly given Claude Code&#x27;s dominance in the developer tools market. David Loker, VP of AI at CodeRabbit, said the model \"punches way above its weight class for the vast majority of real-world PRs.\" Leo Tchourakov of Factory AI said the team is \"transitioning our Sonnet traffic over to this model.\" GitHub&#x27;s VP of Product, Joe Binder, confirmed the model is \"already excelling at complex code fixes, especially when searching across large codebases is essential.\"Brendan Falk, Founder and CEO of Hercules, went further: \"Claude Sonnet 4.6 is the best model we have seen to date. It has Opus 4.6 level accuracy, instruction following, and UI, all for a meaningfully lower cost.\"A simulated business competition reveals how AI agents plan over months, not minutesBuried in the technical details is a capability that hints at where autonomous AI agents are heading. Sonnet 4.6&#x27;s 1M token context window can hold entire codebases, lengthy contracts, or dozens of research papers in a single request. Anthropic says the model reasons effectively across all that context — a claim the company demonstrated through an unusual evaluation.The Vending-Bench Arena tests how well a model can run a simulated business over time, with different AI models competing against each other for the biggest profits. Without human prompting, Sonnet 4.6 developed a novel strategy: it invested heavily in capacity for the first ten simulated months, spending significantly more than its competitors, and then pivoted sharply to focus on profitability in the final stretch. The model ended its 365-day simulation at approximately $5,700 in balance, compared to Sonnet 4.5&#x27;s roughly $2,100.This kind of multi-month strategic planning, executed autonomously, represents a qualitatively different capability than answering questions or generating code snippets. It is the type of long-horizon reasoning that makes AI agents viable for real business operations — and it helps explain why Anthropic is positioning Sonnet 4.6 not just as a chatbot upgrade, but as the engine for a new generation of autonomous systems.Anthropic&#x27;s Sonnet 4.6 arrives as the company expands into enterprise markets and defenseThis release does not arrive in a vacuum. Anthropic is in the middle of the most consequential stretch in its history, and the competitive landscape is intensifying on every front.On the same day as this launch, TechCrunch reported that Indian IT giant Infosys announced a partnership with Anthropic to build enterprise-grade AI agents, integrating Claude models into Infosys&#x27;s Topaz AI platform for banking, telecoms, and manufacturing. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei told TechCrunch there is \"a big gap between an AI model that works in a demo and one that works in a regulated industry,\" and that Infosys helps bridge it. TechCrunch also reported that Anthropic opened its first India office in Bengaluru, and that India now accounts for about 6% of global Claude usage, second only to the U.S. The company, which CNBC reported is valued at $183 billion, has been expanding its enterprise footprint rapidly.Meanwhile, Anthropic president Daniela Amodei told ABC News last week that AI would make humanities majors \"more important than ever,\" arguing that critical thinking skills would become more valuable as large language models master technical work. It is the kind of statement a company makes when it believes its technology is about to reshape entire categories of white-collar employment.The competitive picture for Sonnet 4.6 is also notable. The model outperforms Google&#x27;s Gemini 3 Pro and OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.2 on multiple benchmarks. GPT-5.2 trails on agentic computer use (38.2% vs. 72.5%), agentic search (77.9% vs. 74.7% for Sonnet 4.6&#x27;s non-Pro score), and agentic financial analysis (59.0% vs. 63.3%). Gemini 3 Pro shows competitive performance on visual reasoning and multilingual benchmarks, but falls behind on the agentic categories where enterprise investment is surging.The broader takeaway may not be about any single model. It is about what happens when Opus-class intelligence becomes available for a few dollars per million tokens rather than a few tens of dollars. Companies that were cautiously piloting AI agents with small deployments now face a fundamentally different cost calculus. The agents that were too expensive to run continuously in January are suddenly affordable in February.Claude Sonnet 4.6 is available now on all Claude plans, Claude Cowork, Claude Code, the API, and all major cloud platforms. Anthropic has also upgraded its free tier to Sonnet 4.6 by default. Developers can access it immediately using claude-sonnet-4-6 via the Claude API.",

Gemini 3 Pro shows competitive performance on visual reasoning and multilingual benchmarks, but falls behind on the agentic categories where enterprise investment is surging.The broader takeaway may not be about any single model. It is about what happens when Opus-class intelligence becomes available for a few dollars per million tokens rather than a few tens of dollars. Companies that were cautiously piloting AI agents with small deployments now face a fundamentally different cost calculus. The agents that were too expensive to run continuously in January are suddenly affordable in February.Claude Sonnet 4.6 is available now on all Claude plans, Claude Cowork, Claude Code, the API, and all major cloud platforms. Anthropic has also upgraded its free tier to Sonnet 4.6 by default. Developers can access it immediately using claude-sonnet-4-6 via the Claude API.",

          "standfirst": "The chatbot era may have just received its obituary. Peter Steinberger, the creator of OpenClaw — the open-source AI agent that took the developer world by storm over the past month, raising concerns among enterprise security teams — announced over the weekend that he is joining OpenAI to \"work on bringing agents to everyone.\" The OpenClaw project itself will transition to an independent foundation, though OpenAI is already sponsoring it and may have influence over its direction.The move represents OpenAI&#x27;s most aggressive bet yet on the idea that the future of AI isn&#x27;t about what models can say, but what they can do. For IT leaders evaluating their AI strategy, the acquisition is a signal that the industry&#x27;s center of gravity is shifting decisively from conversational interfaces toward autonomous agents that browse, click, execute code, and complete tasks on users&#x27; behalf.From playground project to the hottest acquisition target in AIOpenClaw&#x27;s path to OpenAI was anything but conventional. The project began life last year as \"ClawdBot\" — a nod to Anthropic&#x27;s Claude model that many developers were using to power it. Released in November 2025, it was the work of Steinberger, a veteran software developer with 13 years of experience building and running a company, who pivoted to exploring AI agents as what he described as a \"playground project.\"The agent distinguished itself from previous attempts at autonomous AI — most notably the AutoGPT moment of 2023 — by combining several capabilities that had previously existed in isolation: tool access, sandboxed code execution, persistent memory, skills and easy integration with messaging platforms like Telegram, WhatsApp, and Discord. The result was an agent that didn&#x27;t just think, but acted.In December 2025 and especially January and early February 2026, OpenClaw saw a rapid, \"hockey stick\" rate of adoption among AI \"vibe coders\" and developers impressed with its ability to complete tasks autonomously across applications and the entire PC environment, including carrying on messenger conversations with users and posting content on its own. In his blog post announcing the move to OpenAI, Steinberger framed the decision in characteristically understated terms. He acknowledged the project could have become \"a huge company\" but said that wasn&#x27;t what interested him. Instead, he wrote that his next mission is to \"build an agent that even my mum can use\" — a goal he believes requires access to frontier models and research that only a major lab can provide.Sam Altman confirmed the hire in a post stating that Steinberger would drive the next generation of personal agents at OpenAI.Anthropic&#x27;s missed opportunityThe acquisition also raises uncomfortable questions for Anthropic. OpenClaw was originally built to work on Claude and carried a name — ClawdBot — that nodded to the model. Rather than embrace the community building on its platform, Anthropic reportedly sent Steinberger a cease-and-desist letter, giving him a matter of days to rename the project and sever any association with Claude, or face legal action. The company even refused to allow the old domains to redirect to the renamed project.The reasoning was not without merit — early OpenClaw deployments were rife with security issues, as users ran agents with root access and minimal safeguards on unsecured machines. But the heavy-handed legal approach meant Anthropic effectively pushed the most viral agent project in recent memory directly into the arms of its chief rival.\"Catching lightning in a bottle\": LangChain CEO weighs in Harrison Chase, co-founder and CEO of LangChain, offered a candid assessment of the OpenClaw phenomenon and its acquisition in an exclusive interview for an upcoming episode of VentureBeat&#x27;s Beyond The Pilot podcast.Chase drew a direct parallel between OpenClaw&#x27;s rise and the breakout moments that defined earlier waves of AI tooling. He noted that success in the space often comes down to timing and momentum rather than technical superiority alone. He pointed to his own experience with LangChain, as well as ChatGPT and AutoGPT, as examples of projects that captured the developer imagination at exactly the right moment — while similar projects that launched around the same time did not.What set OpenClaw apart, Chase argued, was its willingness to be \"unhinged\" — a term he used affectionately. He revealed that LangChain told its own employees they could not install OpenClaw on company laptops due to the security risks involved. That very recklessness, he suggested, was what made the project resonate in ways that a more cautious lab release never could.\"OpenAI is never going to release anything like that. They can&#x27;t release anything like that,\" Chase said. \"But that&#x27;s what makes OpenClaw OpenClaw. And so if you don&#x27;t do that, you also can&#x27;t have an OpenClaw.\"Chase credited the project&#x27;s viral growth to a deceptively simple playbook: build in public and share your work on social media. He drew a parallel to the early days of LangChain, noting that both projects gained traction through their founders consistently shipping and tweeting about their progress, reaching the highly concentrated AI community on X.On the strategic value of the acquisition, Chase was more measured. He acknowledged that every enterprise developer likely wants a \"safe version of OpenClaw\" but questioned whether acquiring the project itself gets OpenAI meaningfully closer to that goal. He pointed to Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Cowork as a product that is conceptually similar — more locked down, fewer connections, but aimed at the same vision.Perhaps his most provocative observation was about what OpenClaw reveals about the nature of agents themselves. Chase argued that coding agents are effectively general-purpose agents, because the ability to write and execute code under the hood gives them capabilities far beyond what any fixed UI could provide. The user never sees the code — they just interact in natural language — but that&#x27;s what provides the agent with its expansive abilities.He identified three key takeaways from the OpenClaw phenomenon that are shaping LangChain&#x27;s own roadmap: natural language as the primary interface, memory as a critical enabler that allows users to \"build something without realizing they&#x27;re building something,\" and code generation as the engine of general-purpose agency.What this means for enterprise AI strategyFor IT decision-makers, the OpenClaw acquisition crystallizes several trends that have been building throughout 2025 and into 2026.First, the competitive landscape for AI agents is consolidating rapidly. Meta recently acquired Manus AI, a full agent system, as well as Limitless AI, a wearable device that captures life context for LLM integration. OpenAI&#x27;s own previous attempts at agentic products — including its Agents API, Agents SDK, and the Atlas agentic browser — failed to gain the traction that OpenClaw achieved seemingly overnight.Second, the gap between what&#x27;s possible in open-source experimentation and what&#x27;s deployable in enterprise settings remains significant. OpenClaw&#x27;s power came precisely from the lack of guardrails that would be unacceptable in a corporate environment. The race to build the \"safe enterprise version of OpenClaw,\" as Chase put it, is now the central question facing every platform vendor in the space.Third, the acquisition underscores that the most important AI interfaces may not come from the labs themselves. Just as the most impactful mobile apps didn&#x27;t come from Apple or Google, the killer agent experiences may emerge from independent builders who are willing to push boundaries the major labs cannot. IT decision-makers have to be asking themselves currently Will the claw close?The open-source community&#x27;s central concern is whether OpenClaw will remain genuinely open under OpenAI&#x27;s umbrella. Steinberger has committed to moving the project to a foundation structure, and Altman has publicly stated the project will stay open source. But OpenAI&#x27;s own complicated history with the word \"open\" — the company is currently facing litigation over its transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity — makes the community understandably skeptical.For now, the acquisition marks a definitive moment: the industry&#x27;s focus has officially shifted from what AI can say to what AI can do. Whether OpenClaw becomes the foundation of OpenAI&#x27;s agent platform or a footnote like AutoGPT before it will depend on whether the magic that made it viral — the unhinged, boundary-pushing, security-be-damned energy of an independent hacker — can survive inside the walls of a $300 billion company.As Steinberger signed off on his announcement: \"The claw is the law.\"",

But you’re still going to be wary of it dying on you if you’re on a trip or just having a particularly screen-heavy day. That’s where Apple’s iPhone Air MagSafe battery pack comes in, and it’s currently on sale for $79. This accessory only works with the iPhone Air, but much like the phone it attaches to, it’s extremely slim at 7.5mmm, so crucially doesn’t add so much bulk when attached that it defeats the point of having a thin phone in the first place. The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the AirPods Pro 3 as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack. At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an \"essential accessory\" for some users in his iPhone Air review. Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.

          "title": "SurrealDB 3.0 wants to replace your five-database RAG stack with one",
          "standfirst": "Building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for AI agents often involves using multiple layers and technologies for structured data, vectors and graph information. In recent months it has also become increasingly clear that agentic AI systems need memory, sometimes referred to as contextual memory, to operate effectively.The complexity and synchronization of having different data layers to enable context can lead to performance and accuracy issues. It&#x27;s a challenge that SurrealDB is looking to solve.SurrealDB on Tuesday launched version 3.0 of its namesake database alongside a $23 million Series A extension, bringing total funding to $44 million. The company had taken a different architectural approach than relational databases like PostgreSQL, native vector databases like Pinecone or a graph database like Neo4j. The OpenAI engineering team recently detailed how it scaled Postgres to 800 million users using read replicas — an approach that works for read-heavy workloads. SurrealDB takes a different approach: Store agent memory, business logic, and multi-modal data directly inside the database. Instead of synchronizing across multiple systems, vector search, graph traversal, and relational queries all run transactionally in a single Rust-native engine that maintains consistency.\"People are running DuckDB, Postgres, Snowflake, Neo4j, Quadrant or Pinecone all together, and then they&#x27;re wondering why they can&#x27;t get good accuracy in their agents,\" CEO and co-founder Tobie Morgan Hitchcock told VentureBeat. \"It&#x27;s because they&#x27;re having to send five different queries to five different databases which only have the knowledge or the context that they deal with.\"The architecture has resonated with developers, with 2.3 million downloads and 31,000 GitHub stars to date for the database. Existing deployments span edge devices in cars and defense systems, product recommendation engines for major New York retailers, and Android ad serving technologies, according to Hitchcock.Agentic AI memory baked into the databaseSurrealDB stores agent memory as graph relationships and semantic metadata directly in the database, not in application code or external caching layers. The Surrealism plugin system in SurrealDB 3.0 lets developers define how agents build and query this memory; the logic runs inside the database with transactional guarantees rather than in middleware.Here&#x27;s what that means in practice: When an agent interacts with data, it creates context graphs that link entities, decisions and domain knowledge as database records. These relationships are queryable through the same SurrealQL interface used for vector search and structured data. An agent asking about a customer issue can traverse graph connections to related past incidents, pull vector embeddings of similar cases, and join with structured customer data — all in one transactional query.\"People don&#x27;t want to store just the latest data anymore,\" Hitchcock said. \"They want to store all that data. They want to analyze and have the AI understand and run through all the data of an organization over the last year or two, because that informs their model, their AI agent about context, about history, and that can therefore deliver better results.\"How SurrealDB&#x27;s architecture differs from traditional RAG stacksTraditional RAG systems query databases based on data types. Developers write separate queries for vector similarity search, graph traversal, and relational joins, then merge results in application code. This creates synchronization delays as queries round-trip between systems.In contrast, Hitchcock explained that SurrealDB stores data as binary-encoded documents with graph relationships embedded directly alongside them. A single query through SurrealQL can traverse graph relationships, perform vector similarity searches, and join structured records without leaving the database.That architecture also affects how consistency works at scale: Every node maintains transactional consistency, even at 50+ node scale, Hitchcock said. When an agent writes new context to node A, a query on node B immediately sees that update. No caching, no read replicas.\"A lot of our use cases, a lot of our deployments are where data is constantly updated and the relationships, the context, the semantic understanding, or the graph connections between that data needs to be constantly refreshed,\" he said. \"So no caching. There&#x27;s no read replicas. In SurrealDB, every single thing is transactional.\"What this means for enterprise IT\"It&#x27;s important to say SurrealDB is not the best database for every task. I&#x27;d love to say we are, but it&#x27;s not. And you can&#x27;t be,\" Hitchcock said. \"If you only need analysis over petabytes of data and you&#x27;re never really updating that data, then you&#x27;re going to be best going with object storage or a columnar database. If you&#x27;re just dealing with vector search, then you can go with a vector database like Quadrant or Pinecone, and that&#x27;s going to suffice.\"The inflection point comes when you need multiple data types together. The practical benefit shows up in development timelines. What used to take months to build with multi-database orchestration can now launch in days, Hitchcock said.",

Existing deployments span edge devices in cars and defense systems, product recommendation engines for major New York retailers, and Android ad serving technologies, according to Hitchcock.Agentic AI memory baked into the databaseSurrealDB stores agent memory as graph relationships and semantic metadata directly in the database, not in application code or external caching layers. The Surrealism plugin system in SurrealDB 3.0 lets developers define how agents build and query this memory; the logic runs inside the database with transactional guarantees rather than in middleware.Here&#x27;s what that means in practice: When an agent interacts with data, it creates context graphs that link entities, decisions and domain knowledge as database records. These relationships are queryable through the same SurrealQL interface used for vector search and structured data. An agent asking about a customer issue can traverse graph connections to related past incidents, pull vector embeddings of similar cases, and join with structured customer data — all in one transactional query.\"People don&#x27;t want to store just the latest data anymore,\" Hitchcock said. \"They want to store all that data. They want to analyze and have the AI understand and run through all the data of an organization over the last year or two, because that informs their model, their AI agent about context, about history, and that can therefore deliver better results.\"How SurrealDB&#x27;s architecture differs from traditional RAG stacksTraditional RAG systems query databases based on data types. Developers write separate queries for vector similarity search, graph traversal, and relational joins, then merge results in application code. This creates synchronization delays as queries round-trip between systems.In contrast, Hitchcock explained that SurrealDB stores data as binary-encoded documents with graph relationships embedded directly alongside them. A single query through SurrealQL can traverse graph relationships, perform vector similarity searches, and join structured records without leaving the database.That architecture also affects how consistency works at scale: Every node maintains transactional consistency, even at 50+ node scale, Hitchcock said. When an agent writes new context to node A, a query on node B immediately sees that update. No caching, no read replicas.\"A lot of our use cases, a lot of our deployments are where data is constantly updated and the relationships, the context, the semantic understanding, or the graph connections between that data needs to be constantly refreshed,\" he said. \"So no caching. There&#x27;s no read replicas. In SurrealDB, every single thing is transactional.\"What this means for enterprise IT\"It&#x27;s important to say SurrealDB is not the best database for every task. I&#x27;d love to say we are, but it&#x27;s not. And you can&#x27;t be,\" Hitchcock said. \"If you only need analysis over petabytes of data and you&#x27;re never really updating that data, then you&#x27;re going to be best going with object storage or a columnar database. If you&#x27;re just dealing with vector search, then you can go with a vector database like Quadrant or Pinecone, and that&#x27;s going to suffice.\"The inflection point comes when you need multiple data types together. The practical benefit shows up in development timelines. What used to take months to build with multi-database orchestration can now launch in days, Hitchcock said.",

          "standfirst": "As AI-powered coding tools flood the market, a critical weakness has emerged: by default, as with most LLM chat sessions, they are temporary — as soon as you close a session and start a new one, the tool forgets everything you were just working on. Developers have worked around this by having coding tools and agents save their state to markdown and text files, but this solution is hacky at best. Qodo, the AI code review startup, believes it has a solution with the launch of what it calls the industry&#x27;s first intelligent Rules System for AI governance — a framework that gives AI code reviewers persistent, organizational memory.The new system, announced today as part of Qodo 2.1, replaces static, manually maintained rule files with an intelligent governance layer. It automatically generates rules from actual code patterns and past review decisions, continuously maintains rule health, enforces standards in every code review, and measures real-world impact.For Itamar Friedman, CEO and co-founder of Qodo, the release represents a pivotal moment not just for his company but for the entire AI development tools space.\"I strongly believe that this announcement of ours is most important we ever done,\" Friedman said in an interview with VentureBeat.The &#x27;Memento&#x27; problemTo explain the limitation of current AI coding tools, Friedman invokes the 2000 Christopher Nolan film Memento, in which the protagonist suffers from short-term memory loss and must tattoo notes on his body to remember crucial information.\"Every time you call them, it&#x27;s a machine that wakes up from scratch,\" Friedman said of today&#x27;s AI coding assistants. \"So all it can do is, before it goes to sleep and restart, it could write whatever it did in a file.\"This approach—saving context to markdown files like agents.md or napkin.md—has become a common workaround among developers using tools like Claude Code and Cursor. But Friedman argues this method breaks down at enterprise scale.\"Think about heavy duty software where you now have, let&#x27;s say, 100,000 of those sticky notes,\" he said. \"Some of them are sticky notes. Some of them are huge explanations. Some of them are stories. You wake up and you get a task. The first thing that [the AI] is doing is statistically starting to look for the right memos... It&#x27;s much better than not having it. But it&#x27;s very random.\"From stateless to statefulThe evolution of AI development tools has followed a clear trajectory, according to Friedman: from autocomplete (GitHub Copilot) to question-and-answer (ChatGPT) to agentic coding within the IDE (Cursor) to agentic capabilities everywhere (Claude Code). But he contends all of these remain fundamentally stateless.\"In order for software development to really revolutionize how we do software development for real world software, it needs to be a stateful machine,\" Friedman said.The core challenge, he explained, is that code quality is inherently subjective. Different organizations have different standards, and even teams within the same enterprise may approach problems differently.\"In order to really reach high level of automation, you need to be able to customize for the specific requirements of the enterprise,\" Friedman said. \"You need to be able to provide code in high quality. But quality is subjective.\"Qodo&#x27;s answer is what Friedman describes as \"memory that is built over a long time and is accessible to the coding agents, and then they can poke and check and verify that what they&#x27;re actually doing is according to the subjective needs of the enterprise.\"How Qodo&#x27;s Rules System worksQodo&#x27;s Rules System establishes what the company calls a unified source of truth for organizational coding standards. The system includes several key components:Automatic Rule Discovery: A Rules Discovery Agent generates standards from codebases and pull request feedback, eliminating manual authoring of rule files.Intelligent Maintenance: A Rules Expert Agent continuously identifies conflicts, duplicates, and outdated standards to prevent what the company calls \"rule decay.\"Scalable Enforcement: Rules are automatically enforced during pull request code review, with recommended fixes provided to developers.Real-World Analytics: Organizations can track adoption rates, violation trends, and improvement metrics to prove standards are being followed.Friedman emphasized that this represents a fundamental shift in how AI code review tools operate. \"It&#x27;s the first time that AI code review tool is moving from reactive to proactive,\" he said.The system surfaces rules based on code patterns, best practices, and its own library, then presents them to technical leads for approval. Once accepted, organizations receive statistics on rule adoption and violations across their entire codebase.A tighter connection between memory and agentsWhat distinguishes Qodo&#x27;s approach, according to Friedman, is how tightly the rules system integrates with the AI agents themselves—as opposed to treating memory as an external resource the AI must search through.\"At Qodo, this memory and agents are much more connected, like we have in our brain,\" Friedman said. \"There&#x27;s much more structure to it... where different parts are well connected and not separated.\"Friedman noted that Qodo applies fine-tuning and reinforcement learning techniques to this integrated system, which he credits for the company achieving an 11% improvement in precision and recall over other platforms, successfully identifying 580 defects across 100 real-world production PRs.Friedman offered a prediction for the industry: \"When you look one year ahead, it will be very clear that when we started 2026, we were in stateless machines that are trying to hack how they interact with memory. And we will have a very coupled way by the end of 2026, and Qodo 2.1 is the first blueprint of how to do that.\"Enterprise deployment and pricingQodo positions itself as an enterprise-first company, offering multiple deployment options. Organizations can deploy the system entirely within their own infrastructure via cloud premise or VPN, use a single-tenant SaaS option where Qodo hosts an isolated instance, or opt for traditional self-serve SaaS.The rules and memory files can reside wherever the enterprise requires—on their own cloud infrastructure or hosted by Qodo—addressing data governance concerns that enterprise customers typically raise.On pricing, Qodo is maintaining its existing seat-based model with usage quotas. At present, the company offers three pricing tiers: a free Developer plan for individuals with 30 PR reviews per month, a Teams plan at $38 per user per month (with 21% savings available for annual billing) that includes 20 PRs per user monthly and 2,500 IDE/CLI credits, and a custom-priced Enterprise plan with contact-us pricing that adds features like multi-repo context awareness, on-prem deployment options, SSO, and priority support.Friedman acknowledged the ongoing industry debate about whether seat-based pricing makes sense in an age of AI agents but said the company plans to address this topic more comprehensively later this year.\"If you get more value, you pay more,\" Friedman said. \"If you don&#x27;t, then we&#x27;re all good.\"Early customer responseOfer Morag Brin of HR technology company Hibob, an early user of the Rules System, reported positive results in a press statement Qodo shared with VentureBeat ahead of the launch.\"Qodo&#x27;s Rules System didn&#x27;t just surface the standards we had scattered across different places; it operationalized them,\" Brin said. \"The system continuously reinforces how our teams actually review and write code, and we are seeing stronger consistency, faster onboarding, and measurable improvements in review quality across teams.\"Founded in 2018, Qodo has raised $50 million from investors including TLV Partners, Vine Ventures, Susa Ventures, and Square Peg, with angel investors from OpenAI, Shopify, and Snyk.",

          "standfirst": "AirTags are basically an essential accessory for iPhone users who want to keep track of things like their keys, wallet and backpack. While it's easy enough to replace the battery in both versions of the AirTag, you may not want to have to rush to do so at the end of the battery's roughly two-year lifespan. That's where Elevation Lab's extended battery case for the AirTag comes in, and it's heavily discounted right now: it's 30 percent off and down to $16. The case usually sells for $23, so that's a 30 percent discount. It's not the first time we've seen this deal, but it's a pretty decent one all the same. This is arguably one of the more useful AirTag accessories around for certain use cases. It won't exactly be helpful for an AirTag that you put in a wallet or attach to your keys, as it's too bulky for such a purpose — and it doesn't have a hole for a keyring anyway. Still, if you're looking for an AirTag case that you can place in a suitcase or backpack and not have to touch for years, this could be the ticket. Elevation Lab says that, when you place a couple of AA batteries in the case, it can extend the tracker's battery life to as much as 10 years (the brand recommends using Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries for best results). The AirTag is slated to run for over a year on its standard CR2032 button cell. The case gives the AirTag more protection as well. It's sealed with four screws and it has a IP69 waterproof rating. What's more, it doesn't ostensibly look like an AirTag case, so someone who steals an item with one inside is perhaps less likely to realize that the object they pilfered is being tracked. There are some other downsides, though. Since the AirTag is locked inside a case, the sound it emits will be muffled. Elevation Lab says the device's volume will be about two-thirds the level of a case-free AirTag. However, the second-gen AirTag is louder than its predecessor, which should mitigate that issue somewhat.

          "standfirst": "Noise is hard to escape, whether it’s the hum of traffic, the buzz of a busy office or the neighbor’s lawn mower starting up right when you need to focus. That’s where noise-canceling headphones earn their keep. A good pair doesn’t just quiet the world around you, it creates a pocket of calm so you can actually enjoy your music, podcasts or peace and quiet.Modern noise-canceling headphones have come a long way, combining powerful ANC with clearer sound, longer battery life and smarter features like adaptive modes and multipoint connectivity. Some emphasize comfort for long flights, while others are tuned for audiophiles who want studio-level clarity.We’ve tested a wide range of options to find the best noise-canceling headphones for every listener. Whether you’re after something lightweight for travel or a premium set for focused work sessions, these picks deliver the sound, silence and comfort you need to tune out the chaos. Best noise-canceling headphones of 2026 How to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you Design When you’re shopping for the best wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of this guide, I focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear, active noise-canceling headphones are much more effective at blocking outside sounds since your ears are completely covered. For gamers, there are also gaming headsets that feature noise cancellation — some even have detachable microphones, so they can double as over-ear headphones. However, for the purpose of this article, we’re only going to be focusing on noise-canceling headphones rather than headsets. Look for models with a comfortable headband and memory foam ear cups to ensure you can wear them for long periods without discomfort. Many headphones also come with a range of color options, so if aesthetics matter to you, you’ll find plenty of choices beyond just black or white. Whether you’re looking for something neutral or a bold pop of color, brands now offer a variety of styles to match your personal taste. Finally, if you’re planning to wear your headphones for long periods of time, it’s important to pick a model with a comfortable fit. Memory foam ear cups, an adjustable headband, and lightweight materials can make all the difference during extended listening sessions. After all, great sound is only part of the equation; comfort matters just as much. Type of noise cancellation Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of headphones offers. You’ll come across terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside and on the outside of the device to detect outside noise and cancel it out. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn’t change. Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience. Customization You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master & Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments. How we test noise-canceling headphones The primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours. To test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones. ANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review. Other noise-canceling headphones we tested AirPods Max Apple’s AirPods Max are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancellation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us. Dyson On-Trac The On-Trac headphones have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor, which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot for a set of $500 headphones. Sonos Ace The Sonos Ace is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users. Sony ULT Wear If most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the ULT Wear is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range. Beats Studio Pro The Studio Pro lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average. Master & Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen) The MH40 are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut. Bowers & Wilkins Px8 The company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the Px8 is more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S3. Noble Audio FoKus Apollo While this is my top pick for overall sound quality in our main guide to the best wireless headphones, the ANC performance is less impressive than the Px7 S3. Bowers & Wilkins gets the nod here for its improved noise cancellation over the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, and its overall excellent audio quality. Noise-canceling headphones FAQs Does noise cancellation block all noise? Noise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds. Is there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones? In terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds. Does noise cancellation impact sound quality? ANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html?src=rss",

          "title": "The best Apple Watch in 2026",
          "standfirst": "There are just three models of Apple Watch — and $500 separates the most affordable from the premium model, with the flagship landing somewhere in between. Before the launch of the overhauled Apple Watch SE 3 in late 2025, it was pretty easy to direct most people to the Apple Watch Series 11. But with its new display and faster charging, the budget model makes a lot more sense now. There’s also a case for recommending the refreshed Apple Watch Ultra 3 to diehard adventurers and outdoor enthusiasts. Here, we spell out just what differentiates the models as well as what you get when you buy any Apple Watch. Using insights gleaned from Engadget’s own reviews, this guide will help you pick the best Apple Watch for you. Best Apple Watch in 2026 What to look for in an Apple Watch Like all Apple products, Apple Watches will only work with other devices from the brand's ecosystem. You won't be able to pair any Apple Watch to your Android phone. Note that you can pair other wearables (like a Garmin tracker or a Fitbit band) with your iPhone. There are some more features that are specific to Apple Watches and that set each of the three models apart from one another. Chips and sensors All three models in the current lineup have the same S10 SiP (system in a package) chip with a four-core Neural Engine. The chip allows for on-device processing of Siri requests as well as dictation, translation, automatic workout detection and the double tap and wrist flick gestures that let you control your watch hands-free. You get an optical heart rate sensor, temperature sensor, compass, altimeter, accelerometer, gyroscope and light sensor in every Apple Watch model, but the Series 11 and Ultra 3 have a more advanced heart monitor that in part enables the new hypertension detection feature. The two higher-end watches also have sensors that can generate an ECG and detect blood oxygen, water temperature and water depth. They also include an Ultra Wideband chip that works in conjunction with the latest AirTags to precisely find Apple’s trackers. Fall and crash detection come standard no matter which Apple wearable you pick and all support near field communication (NFC) for Apple Pay. If you opt for the cellular versions of the Series 11 or SE 3, your watch will have access to 5G networks. Cell connectivity comes standard on the Ultra 3 and the watch now also has satellite-enabled SOS, messaging and Find My abilities. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Displays and case options Every Apple Watch model now has an always-on display. The wide-angle OLED display on the Apple Watch 11 and Ultra 3 lets you see the always-on display from more angles. The SE can reach a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, the Series 11 can get as bright as 2,000 and the Ultra 3 hits 3,000 nits. Both higher-end screens can dim to a single nit, making them less distracting in the dark. And the Ultra model has the added night mode feature on certain watch faces that turns the dial red to preserve your night vision. As for case sizes, the SE 3 is available in 40 or 44mm. The Series 11 has a choice of a 42 or 46mm case. The Ultra 3 comes in just one size measuring 49mm. The SE 3 has an aluminum case in two colors (Starlight or Midnight). The Series 11 lets you pick from aluminum (in Rose Gold, Silver, Space Gray or Jet Black) or titanium (in Natural, Gold or Slate). And the Ultra 3 only comes in titanium (either Natural or Black). Battery life The Apple Watch Ultra 3 sports the biggest battery and can last for a claimed 42 hours on a charge. The Apple Watch 11 is rated to go for 24 hours and the SE 3 gets an estimated 18 hours before it needs a visit to the charger. Low power mode will get you many more hours, going for as long as 72 hours for the Ultra 3, 38 hours on the Series 11 and 32 hours on the SE 3. All three are now capable of fast charging and Apple states an 80 percent charge in 45 minutes for the SE 3 and Ultra 3 and 80 percent in 30 minutes for the Series 11. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Fitness and wellness features All three Apple Watches have similar fitness tracking chops. The Activity app uses three “rings” to keep tabs on how much you’re moving in a day: The Move ring tracks your active calories; the Exercise ring monitors the minutes you’ve spent walking, running, doing yoga and so on; and the Stand ring tells you how many hours in a day you’ve stood up and moved around for at least one minute. Different internal sensors detect those activities, for example the accelerometer senses when you’re moving versus sitting still, and the optical heart rate sensor judges how hard you're working out and how many calories you’ve burned. You can set your goals for each ring and you’ll earn badges and animations when you hit them. The Workout Buddy will work with all three watches, but you’ll need to have an Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhone nearby as well as Bluetooth headphones to use it. All three can access offline maps, which could prove useful when hiking far from cellular coverage. But if going off-grid is something you plan to do often, you may appreciate the satellite connectivity of the Apple Watch Ultra 3. Siri You can get the weather, start a workout, identify a song and dictate a text just by asking Siri. All Apple Watch models support the Raise to Speak feature that bypasses the need to say “Hey Siri” and will instead listen for your request when you lift your wrist near your mouth. Every Apple Watch model utilizes onboard processing of Siri requests now, too. That means executing simple requests like starting workouts and timers are quicker, as they won’t need to access external networks. However, requests like sending texts or getting weather forecasts still need to communicate with Wi-Fi or cellular, so you’ll need to have your phone nearby if you have a GPS-only model. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Carbon neutral claims Apple declared the Series 9 with the aluminum case its first carbon neutral product. But has since dropped those claims, possibly due to legal challenges in a German court. Instead, Apple states that all three watches have been designed to “reduce environmental impact” and the company still maintains its commitment to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. Price Perhaps the most surprising thing about the three new wearables was the lack of price increase from previous models. The Apple Watch SE still starts at $249, the Series 11 goes for $399 and up, and the Ultra 3 begins at $799. That puts a $550 difference between entry prices for the cheapest and most expensive Apple Watches. For $250 you can get the 40mm Apple Watch SE 3 with GPS-only connectivity; adding cellular connectivity ups the price by $50. The Apple Watch Series 11 starts at $399 for the 42mm, non-cellular model in aluminum and goes as high as $749 for the 46mm titanium case (which comes with cellular). The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is $799 for a titanium 49mm case with both GPS and cellular, but the price goes up with different bands. You may also need a few Apple Watch accessories, if so, you can factor that into your purchasing decision. Cherlynn Low for Engadget How we tested Apple Watches Engadget has been reviewing Apple Watches since the first one came out in 2015. Since then, we’ve tested every subsequent model Apple has released, including the Ultra and SE models, spending at least a few days or even a couple weeks with one strapped to our wrists. During that time, we run, hit the gym, go on hikes and wear it while sleeping, all the while gauging how it tracks various metrics, integrates with the iPhone and performs every other trick Apple claims its smartwatches can do. Since we also review smartwatches from other companies, such as Samsung's Galaxy Watches and Google Pixels, our editors can compare Apple Watches not just to previous generations, but also to other wearables on the market. Our buying guides and recommendations rely on first-hand testing by Engadget staff.

All three watches use the same Fitness and Workout apps to track your progress, and they all have sensors to track speed, cadence, distance and heart rate. But the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11 have more sensors than the Apple Watch SE 3. Additional tech includes an electrical heart rate sensor and a depth gauge. The two pricier watches also have a blood oxygen app and an ECG app, all of which may give you a better picture of your overall health. All three models are compatible with the AI-powered Workout Buddy from watchOS 26 (the feature also requires an AI-compatible iPhone). Are any of the Apple Watch series waterproof? All three models are water resistant. But they can all handle immersion in water, including a swim. The Apple Watch SE 3 and Series 11 can handle a depth of up to 50 meters while the Ultra 3 can be submerged up to 100 meters.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-apple-watch-160005462.html?src=rss",

But with its new display and faster charging, the budget model makes a lot more sense now. There’s also a case for recommending the refreshed Apple Watch Ultra 3 to diehard adventurers and outdoor enthusiasts. Here, we spell out just what differentiates the models as well as what you get when you buy any Apple Watch. Using insights gleaned from Engadget’s own reviews, this guide will help you pick the best Apple Watch for you. Best Apple Watch in 2026 What to look for in an Apple Watch Like all Apple products, Apple Watches will only work with other devices from the brand's ecosystem. You won't be able to pair any Apple Watch to your Android phone. Note that you can pair other wearables (like a Garmin tracker or a Fitbit band) with your iPhone. There are some more features that are specific to Apple Watches and that set each of the three models apart from one another. Chips and sensors All three models in the current lineup have the same S10 SiP (system in a package) chip with a four-core Neural Engine. The chip allows for on-device processing of Siri requests as well as dictation, translation, automatic workout detection and the double tap and wrist flick gestures that let you control your watch hands-free. You get an optical heart rate sensor, temperature sensor, compass, altimeter, accelerometer, gyroscope and light sensor in every Apple Watch model, but the Series 11 and Ultra 3 have a more advanced heart monitor that in part enables the new hypertension detection feature. The two higher-end watches also have sensors that can generate an ECG and detect blood oxygen, water temperature and water depth. They also include an Ultra Wideband chip that works in conjunction with the latest AirTags to precisely find Apple’s trackers. Fall and crash detection come standard no matter which Apple wearable you pick and all support near field communication (NFC) for Apple Pay. If you opt for the cellular versions of the Series 11 or SE 3, your watch will have access to 5G networks. Cell connectivity comes standard on the Ultra 3 and the watch now also has satellite-enabled SOS, messaging and Find My abilities. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Displays and case options Every Apple Watch model now has an always-on display. The wide-angle OLED display on the Apple Watch 11 and Ultra 3 lets you see the always-on display from more angles. The SE can reach a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, the Series 11 can get as bright as 2,000 and the Ultra 3 hits 3,000 nits. Both higher-end screens can dim to a single nit, making them less distracting in the dark. And the Ultra model has the added night mode feature on certain watch faces that turns the dial red to preserve your night vision. As for case sizes, the SE 3 is available in 40 or 44mm. The Series 11 has a choice of a 42 or 46mm case. The Ultra 3 comes in just one size measuring 49mm. The SE 3 has an aluminum case in two colors (Starlight or Midnight). The Series 11 lets you pick from aluminum (in Rose Gold, Silver, Space Gray or Jet Black) or titanium (in Natural, Gold or Slate). And the Ultra 3 only comes in titanium (either Natural or Black). Battery life The Apple Watch Ultra 3 sports the biggest battery and can last for a claimed 42 hours on a charge. The Apple Watch 11 is rated to go for 24 hours and the SE 3 gets an estimated 18 hours before it needs a visit to the charger. Low power mode will get you many more hours, going for as long as 72 hours for the Ultra 3, 38 hours on the Series 11 and 32 hours on the SE 3. All three are now capable of fast charging and Apple states an 80 percent charge in 45 minutes for the SE 3 and Ultra 3 and 80 percent in 30 minutes for the Series 11. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Fitness and wellness features All three Apple Watches have similar fitness tracking chops. The Activity app uses three “rings” to keep tabs on how much you’re moving in a day: The Move ring tracks your active calories; the Exercise ring monitors the minutes you’ve spent walking, running, doing yoga and so on; and the Stand ring tells you how many hours in a day you’ve stood up and moved around for at least one minute. Different internal sensors detect those activities, for example the accelerometer senses when you’re moving versus sitting still, and the optical heart rate sensor judges how hard you're working out and how many calories you’ve burned. You can set your goals for each ring and you’ll earn badges and animations when you hit them. The Workout Buddy will work with all three watches, but you’ll need to have an Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhone nearby as well as Bluetooth headphones to use it. All three can access offline maps, which could prove useful when hiking far from cellular coverage. But if going off-grid is something you plan to do often, you may appreciate the satellite connectivity of the Apple Watch Ultra 3. Siri You can get the weather, start a workout, identify a song and dictate a text just by asking Siri. All Apple Watch models support the Raise to Speak feature that bypasses the need to say “Hey Siri” and will instead listen for your request when you lift your wrist near your mouth. Every Apple Watch model utilizes onboard processing of Siri requests now, too. That means executing simple requests like starting workouts and timers are quicker, as they won’t need to access external networks. However, requests like sending texts or getting weather forecasts still need to communicate with Wi-Fi or cellular, so you’ll need to have your phone nearby if you have a GPS-only model. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Carbon neutral claims Apple declared the Series 9 with the aluminum case its first carbon neutral product. But has since dropped those claims, possibly due to legal challenges in a German court. Instead, Apple states that all three watches have been designed to “reduce environmental impact” and the company still maintains its commitment to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. Price Perhaps the most surprising thing about the three new wearables was the lack of price increase from previous models. The Apple Watch SE still starts at $249, the Series 11 goes for $399 and up, and the Ultra 3 begins at $799. That puts a $550 difference between entry prices for the cheapest and most expensive Apple Watches. For $250 you can get the 40mm Apple Watch SE 3 with GPS-only connectivity; adding cellular connectivity ups the price by $50. The Apple Watch Series 11 starts at $399 for the 42mm, non-cellular model in aluminum and goes as high as $749 for the 46mm titanium case (which comes with cellular). The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is $799 for a titanium 49mm case with both GPS and cellular, but the price goes up with different bands. You may also need a few Apple Watch accessories, if so, you can factor that into your purchasing decision. Cherlynn Low for Engadget How we tested Apple Watches Engadget has been reviewing Apple Watches since the first one came out in 2015. Since then, we’ve tested every subsequent model Apple has released, including the Ultra and SE models, spending at least a few days or even a couple weeks with one strapped to our wrists. During that time, we run, hit the gym, go on hikes and wear it while sleeping, all the while gauging how it tracks various metrics, integrates with the iPhone and performs every other trick Apple claims its smartwatches can do. Since we also review smartwatches from other companies, such as Samsung's Galaxy Watches and Google Pixels, our editors can compare Apple Watches not just to previous generations, but also to other wearables on the market. Our buying guides and recommendations rely on first-hand testing by Engadget staff.

All three watches use the same Fitness and Workout apps to track your progress, and they all have sensors to track speed, cadence, distance and heart rate. But the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11 have more sensors than the Apple Watch SE 3. Additional tech includes an electrical heart rate sensor and a depth gauge. The two pricier watches also have a blood oxygen app and an ECG app, all of which may give you a better picture of your overall health. All three models are compatible with the AI-powered Workout Buddy from watchOS 26 (the feature also requires an AI-compatible iPhone). Are any of the Apple Watch series waterproof? All three models are water resistant. But they can all handle immersion in water, including a swim. The Apple Watch SE 3 and Series 11 can handle a depth of up to 50 meters while the Ultra 3 can be submerged up to 100 meters.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-apple-watch-160005462.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Noise-canceling earbuds have become an everyday essential for a lot of people, whether you’re trying to survive a noisy commute, concentrate in a shared workspace or just carve out a little quiet time. Advances in active noise cancellation and audio processing mean today’s best earbuds do a much better job of cutting through background noise, without forcing you to move up to bulky over-ear headphones.The latest models also balance sound quality with convenience, offering stable Bluetooth connections, comfortable fits and battery life that can last through a full day with help from their charging cases. From premium options with the strongest ANC to more affordable picks that still get the basics right, there’s no shortage of solid choices depending on what you value most. Best noise-cancelling earbuds for 2026 How to choose the best noise-canceling earbuds for you Design Most true wireless earbuds these days have a “traditional” design that’s a round bud that fits in your ear canals. However, there are some variations on the formula in terms of shape, size and additional fitting elements. Some companies include fins or fit wings to help hold their in-ear earbuds in place while others opt for an over-the-ear hook on more sporty models. You’ll want to pay attention to these things to make sure they align with how you plan to use them. Also consider overall size and weight since those two factors can impact the fit. A less-than-ideal seal due to a weird fit will affect the performance of active noise-canceling earbuds. Type of noise cancellation Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of earbuds offer. You’ll see terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside and the outside of the device to detect ambient noise. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it’s at a constant level that doesn’t change. Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups or ear tips. Adaptive ANC is also better at combating wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using earbuds outdoors. For this top pick list of the best noise-canceling earbuds, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise in noisy environments. Customization You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of earbuds offers presets or adjustable levels of noise reduction. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help save battery life. Master & Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that either provide maximum noise-blocking or prioritize energy efficiency. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level. How we test noise-canceling earbuds The primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for ANC earbuds is typically 6-10 hours, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). When necessary, I’ll power the headphones off during a review without putting them back in the case. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to wear them for an entire day. To test ANC performance specifically, I use the earbuds in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I also use them during air travel, since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I’m not slated to hop on a flight, I simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well earbuds block human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC setups. I also do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double-checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set, and revisit the closest competition as well.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-earbuds-150026857.html?src=rss",

Stand at the base, however, and the illusion of smoothness vanishes. You see massive, jagged blocks of limestone. It is not a slope; it is a staircase.​Remember this the next time you hear futurists talking about exponential growth.​Intel’s co-founder Gordon Moore (Moore&#x27;s Law) is famously quoted for saying in 1965 that the transistor count on a microchip would double every year. Another Intel executive, David House, later revised this statement to “compute power doubling every 18 months.\" For a while, Intel’s CPUs were the poster child of this law. That is, until the growth in CPU performance flattened out like a block of limestone.​If you zoom out, though, the next limestone block was already there — the growth in compute merely shifted from CPUs to the world of GPUs. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, played a long game and came out a strong winner, building his own stepping stones initially with gaming, then computer visioniand recently, generative AI.​The illusion of smooth growth​Technology growth is full of sprints and plateaus, and gen AI is not immune. The current wave is driven by transformer architecture. To quote Anthropic’s President and co-founder Dario Amodei: “The exponential continues until it doesn’t. And every year we’ve been like, ‘Well, this can’t possibly be the case that things will continue on the exponential’ — and then every year it has.”​But just as the CPU plateaued and GPUs took the lead, we are seeing signs that LLM growth is shifting paradigms again. For example, late in 2024, DeepSeek surprised the world by training a world-class model on an impossibly small budget, in part by using the MoE technique.​Do you remember where you recently saw this technique mentioned? Nvidia’s Rubin press release: The technology includes “...the latest generations of Nvidia NVLink interconnect technology... to accelerate agentic AI, advanced reasoning and massive-scale MoE model inference at up to 10x lower cost per token.”​Jensen knows that achieving that coveted exponential growth in compute doesn’t come from pure brute force anymore. Sometimes you need to shift the architecture entirely to place the next stepping stone.​The latency crisis: Where Groq fits in​This long introduction brings us to Groq.​The biggest gains in AI reasoning capabilities in 2025 were driven by “inference time compute” — or, in lay terms, “letting the model think for a longer period of time.” But time is money. Consumers and businesses do not like waiting.​Groq comes into play here with its lightning-speed inference. If you bring together the architectural efficiency of models like DeepSeek and the sheer throughput of Groq, you get frontier intelligence at your fingertips. By executing inference faster, you can “out-reason” competitive models, offering a “smarter” system to customers without the penalty of lag.​From universal chip to inference optimization​For the last decade, the GPU has been the universal hammer for every AI nail. You use H100s to train the model; you use H100s (or trimmed-down versions) to run the model. But as models shift toward \"System 2\" thinking — where the AI reasons, self-corrects and iterates before answering — the computational workload changes.​Training requires massive parallel brute force. Inference, especially for reasoning models, requires faster sequential processing. It must generate tokens instantly to facilitate complex chains of thought without the user waiting minutes for an answer. ​Groq’s LPU (Language Processing Unit) architecture removes the memory bandwidth bottleneck that plagues GPUs during small-batch inference, delivering lightning-fast inference.​The engine for the next wave of growth​For the C-Suite, this potential convergence solves the \"thinking time\" latency crisis. Consider the expectations from AI agents: We want them to autonomously book flights, code entire apps and research legal precedent. To do this reliably, a model might need to generate 10,000 internal \"thought tokens\" to verify its own work before it outputs a single word to the user.​On a standard GPU: 10,000 thought tokens might take 20 to 40 seconds. The user gets bored and leaves.​On Groq: That same chain of thought happens in less than 2 seconds.​If Nvidia integrates Groq’s technology, they solve the \"waiting for the robot to think\" problem. They preserve the magic of AI. Just as they moved from rendering pixels (gaming) to rendering intelligence (gen AI), they would now move to rendering reasoning in real-time.​Furthermore, this creates a formidable software moat. Groq’s biggest hurdle has always been the software stack; Nvidia’s biggest asset is CUDA. If Nvidia wraps its ecosystem around Groq’s hardware, they effectively dig a moat so wide that competitors cannot cross it. They would offer the universal platform: The best environment to train and the most efficient environment to run (Groq/LPU).Consider what happens when you couple that raw inference power with a next-generation open source model (like the rumored DeepSeek 4): You get an offering that would rival today’s frontier models in cost, performance and speed. That opens up opportunities for Nvidia, from directly entering the inference business with its own cloud offering, to continuing to power a growing number of exponentially growing customers.​The next step on the pyramid​Returning to our opening metaphor: The \"exponential\" growth of AI is not a smooth line of raw FLOPs; it is a staircase of bottlenecks being smashed.​Block 1: We couldn&#x27;t calculate fast enough. Solution: The GPU.​Block 2: We couldn&#x27;t train deep enough. Solution: Transformer architecture.​Block 3: We can&#x27;t \"think\" fast enough. Solution: Groq’s LPU.​Jensen Huang has never been afraid to cannibalize his own product lines to own the future. By validating Groq, Nvidia wouldn&#x27;t just be buying a faster chip; they would be bringing next-generation intelligence to the masses.Andrew Filev, founder and CEO of Zencoder",

Over the past few months, analysts, supply-chain watchers and leakers have continued to sketch out what Apple’s first folding phone might look like and when it could finally arrive. Most signs still point to a late-2026 debut, though plenty could change between now and then.As always with unreleased Apple hardware, nothing here is confirmed. Plans can shift, features can be reworked and timelines can slip. Still, the volume and consistency of recent reporting gives us a better sense than ever of how the so-called iPhone Fold could take shape.Below, we’ve rounded up the most credible rumors so far, and we’ll keep this guide updated as new details emerge.When could the iPhone Fold launch?Rumors of a foldable iPhone date back as far as 2017, but more recent reporting suggests Apple has finally locked onto a realistic window. Most sources now point to fall 2026, likely alongside the iPhone 18 lineup.Mark Gurman has gone back and forth on timing, initially suggesting Apple could launch “as early as 2026,” before later writing that the device would ship at the end of 2026 and sell primarily in 2027. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also repeatedly cited the second half of 2026 as Apple’s target.Some reports still claim the project could slip into 2027 if Apple runs into manufacturing or durability issues, particularly around the hinge or display. Given Apple’s history of delaying products that it feels aren’t ready, that remains a real possibility.What will the iPhone Fold look like?Current consensus suggests Apple has settled on a book-style foldable design, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, rather than a clamshell flip phone.When unfolded, the iPhone Fold is expected to resemble a small tablet like the iPad mini (8.3 inches). Based on the rumor mill, though, the iPhone Fold may be a touch smaller, with an internal display measuring around 7.7 to 7.8 inches. When closed, it should function like a conventional smartphone, with an outer display in the 5.5-inch range.CAD leaks and alleged case-maker molds suggest the device may be shorter and wider than a standard iPhone when folded, creating a squarer footprint that better matches the aspect ratio of the inner display. Several reports have also pointed to the iPhone Air as a potential preview of Apple’s foldable design work, with its unusually thin chassis widely interpreted as a look at what one half of a future foldable iPhone could resemble.If that theory holds, it could help explain the Fold’s rumored dimensions. Thickness is expected to land between roughly 4.5 and 5.6mm when unfolded, putting it in a similar range to the iPhone Air, and just over 9 to 11mm when folded, depending on the final hinge design and internal layering.iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone AirEngadgetDisplay and the crease questionThe display is arguably the biggest challenge for any foldable phone, and it’s an area where Apple appears to have invested years of development.Multiple reports say Apple will rely on Samsung Display as its primary supplier. At CES 2026, Samsung showcased a new crease-less foldable OLED panel, which several sources — including Bloomberg — suggested could be the same technology Apple plans to use.According to these reports, the panel combines a flexible OLED with a laser-drilled metal support plate that disperses stress when folding. The goal is a display with a nearly invisible crease, something Apple reportedly considers essential before entering the foldable market.If Apple does use this panel, it would mark a notable improvement over current foldables, which still show visible creasing under certain lighting conditions.Cameras and biometricsCamera rumors suggest Apple is planning a four-camera setup. That may include:Two rear cameras (main and ultra-wide, both rumored at 48MP)One punch-hole camera on the outer displayOne under-display camera on the inner screenSeveral sources claim Apple will avoid Face ID entirely on the iPhone Fold. Instead, it’s expected to rely on Touch ID built into the power button, similar to recent iPad models. This would allow Apple to keep both displays free of notches or Dynamic Island cutouts.Under-display camera technology has historically produced lower image quality, but a rumored 24MP sensor would be a significant step up compared to existing foldables, which typically use much lower-resolution sensors.iPhone Fold’s hinge and materialsThe hinge is another area where Apple may diverge from competitors. Multiple reports claim Apple will use Liquidmetal, which is a long-standing trade name for a metallic glass alloy the company has previously used in smaller components. While often referred to as “liquid metal” or “Liquid Metal” in reports, Liquidmetal is the branding Apple has historically associated with the material.Liquidmetal is said to be stronger and more resistant to deformation than titanium, while remaining relatively lightweight. If accurate, this could help improve long-term durability and reduce wear on the foldable display.Leaks from Jon Prosser also reference a metal plate beneath the display that works in tandem with the hinge to minimize creasing — a claim that aligns with reporting from Korean and Chinese supply-chain sources.Battery and other components Battery life is another potential differentiator. According to Ming-Chi Kuo and multiple Asian supply-chain reports, Apple is testing high-density battery cells in the 5,000 to 5,800mAh range.That would make it the largest battery ever used in an iPhone, and competitive with (or larger than) batteries in current Android foldables. The device is also expected to use a future A-series chip and Apple’s in-house modem.PriceNone of this will come cheap, that’s for certain. Nearly every report agrees that the iPhone Fold will be Apple’s most expensive iPhone ever.Estimates currently place the price between $2,000 and $2,500 in the US. Bloomberg has said the price will be “at least $2,000,” while other analysts have narrowed the likely range to around $2,100 and $2,300. That positions the iPhone Fold well above the iPhone Pro Max and closer to Apple’s high-end Macs and iPads.Despite years of rumors, there’s still plenty that remains unclear. Apple hasn’t confirmed the name “iPhone Fold,” final dimensions, software features or how iOS would adapt to a folding form factor. Durability, repairability and long-term reliability are also open questions. For now, the safest assumption is that Apple is taking its time and that many of these details could still change before launch.

          "standfirst": "The gap between ransomware threats and the defenses meant to stop them is getting worse, not better. Ivanti’s 2026 State of Cybersecurity Report found that the preparedness gap widened by an average of 10 points year over year across every threat category the firm tracks. Ransomware hit the widest spread: 63% of security professionals rate it a high or critical threat, but just 30% say they are “very prepared” to defend against it. That’s a 33-point gap, up from 29 points a year ago.CyberArk’s 2025 Identity Security Landscape puts numbers to the problem: 82 machine identities for every human in organizations worldwide. Forty-two percent of those machine identities have privileged or sensitive access. The most authoritative playbook framework has the same blind spotGartner’s ransomware preparation guidance, the April 2024 research note “How to Prepare for Ransomware Attacks” that enterprise security teams reference when building incident response procedures, specifically calls out the need to reset “impacted user/host credentials” during containment. The accompanying Ransomware Playbook Toolkit walks teams through four phases: containment, analysis, remediation, and recovery. The credential reset step instructs teams to ensure all affected user and device accounts are reset.Service accounts are absent. So are API keys, tokens, and certificates. The most widely used playbook framework in enterprise security stops at human and device credentials. The organizations following it inherit that blind spot without realizing it.The same research note identifies the problem without connecting it to the solution. Gartner warns that “poor identity and access management (IAM) practices” remain a primary starting point for ransomware attacks, and that previously compromised credentials are being used to gain access through initial access brokers and dark web data dumps. In the recovery section, the guidance is explicit: updating or removing compromised credentials is essential because, without that step, the attacker will regain entry. Machine identities are IAM. Compromised service accounts are credentials. But the playbook’s containment procedures address neither.Gartner frames the urgency in terms few other sources match: “Ransomware is unlike any other security incident,” the research note states. “It puts affected organizations on a countdown timer. Any delay in the decision-making process introduces additional risk.” The same guidance emphasizes that recovery costs can amount to 10 times the ransom itself, and that ransomware is being deployed within one day of initial access in more than 50% of engagements. The clock is already running, but the containment procedures don’t match the urgency — not when the fastest-growing class of credentials goes unaddressed.The readiness deficit runs deeper than any single surveyIvanti’s report tracks the preparedness gap across every major threat category: ransomware, phishing, software vulnerabilities, API-related vulnerabilities, supply chain attacks, and even poor encryption. Every single one widened year over year. “Although defenders are optimistic about the promise of AI in cybersecurity, Ivanti’s findings also show companies are falling further behind in terms of how well prepared they are to defend against a variety of threats,” said Daniel Spicer, Ivanti’s Chief Security Officer. “This is what I call the ‘Cybersecurity Readiness Deficit,’ a persistent, year-over-year widening imbalance in an organization’s ability to defend their data, people, and networks against the evolving threat landscape.”CrowdStrike’s 2025 State of Ransomware Survey breaks down what that deficit looks like by industry. Among manufacturers who rated themselves “very well prepared,” just 12% recovered within 24 hours, and 40% suffered significant operational disruption. Public sector organizations fared worse: 12% recovery despite 60% confidence. Across all industries, only 38% of organizations that suffered a ransomware attack fixed the specific issue that allowed attackers in. The rest invested in general security improvements without closing the actual entry point.Fifty-four percent of organizations said they would or probably would pay if hit by ransomware today, according to the 2026 report, despite FBI guidance against payment. That willingness to pay reflects a fundamental lack of containment alternatives, exactly the kind that machine identity procedures would provide.Where machine identity playbooks fall shortFive containment steps define most ransomware response procedures today. Machine identities are missing from every one of them.Credential resets weren’t designed for machinesResetting every employee’s password after an incident is standard practice, but it doesn’t stop lateral movement through a compromised service account. Gartner’s own playbook template shows the blind spot clearly. The Ransomware Playbook Sample’s containment sheet lists three credential reset steps: force logout of all affected user accounts via Active Directory, force password change on all affected user accounts via Active Directory, and reset the device account via Active Directory. Three steps, all Active Directory, zero non-human credentials. No service accounts, no API keys, no tokens, no certificates. Machine credentials need their own chain of command.Nobody inventories machine identities before an incidentYou can’t reset credentials that you don’t know exist. Service accounts, API keys, and tokens need ownership assignments mapped pre-incident. Discovering them mid-breach costs days. Just 51% of organizations even have a cybersecurity exposure score, Ivanti&#x27;s report found, which means nearly half couldn’t tell the board their machine identity exposure if asked tomorrow. Only 27% rate their risk exposure assessment as “excellent,” despite 64% investing in exposure management. The gap between investment and execution is where machine identities disappear.Network isolation doesn’t revoke trust chainsPulling a machine off the network doesn’t revoke the API keys it issued to downstream systems. Containment that stops at the network perimeter assumes trust is bounded by topology. Machine identities don’t respect that boundary. They authenticate across it.Gartner’s own research note warns that adversaries can spend days to months burrowing and gaining lateral movement within networks, harvesting credentials for persistence before deploying ransomware. During that burrowing phase, service accounts and API tokens are the credentials most easily harvested without triggering alerts. Seventy-six percent of organizations are concerned about stopping ransomware from spreading from an unmanaged host over SMB network shares, according to CrowdStrike. Security leaders need to map which systems trusted each machine identity so they can revoke access across the entire chain, not just the compromised endpoint.Detection logic wasn’t built for machine behaviorAnomalous machine identity behavior doesn’t trigger alerts the way a compromised user account does. Unusual API call volumes, tokens used outside automation windows, and service accounts authenticating from new locations require detection rules that most SOCs haven’t written. CrowdStrike’s survey found 85% of security teams acknowledge traditional detection methods can’t keep pace with modern threats. Yet only 53% have implemented AI-powered threat detection. The detection logic that would catch machine identity abuse barely exists in most environments.Stale service accounts remain the easiest entry pointAccounts that haven’t been rotated in years, some created by employees who left long ago, are the single weakest surface for machine-based attacks. Gartner’s guidance calls for strong authentication for “privileged users, such as database and infrastructure administrators and service accounts,” but that recommendation sits in the prevention section, not in the containment playbook where teams need it during an active incident. Orphan account audits and rotation schedules belong in pre-incident preparation, not post-breach scrambles.The economics make this urgent nowAgentic AI will multiply the problem. Eighty-seven percent of security professionals say integrating agentic AI is a priority, and 77% report comfort with allowing autonomous AI to act without human oversight, according to the Ivanti report. But just 55% use formal guardrails. Each autonomous agent creates new machine identities, identities that authenticate, make decisions, and act independently. If organizations can’t govern the machine identities they have today, they’re about to add an order of magnitude more.Gartner estimates total recovery costs at 10 times the ransom itself. CrowdStrike puts the average ransomware downtime cost at $1.7 million per incident, with public sector organizations averaging $2.5 million. Paying doesn’t help. Ninety-three percent of organizations that paid had data stolen anyway, and 83% were attacked again. Nearly 40% could not fully restore data from backups after ransomware incidents. The ransomware economy has professionalized to the point where adversary groups now encrypt files remotely over SMB network shares from unmanaged systems, never transferring the ransomware binary to a managed endpoint.Security leaders who build machine identity inventory, detection rules, and containment procedures into their playbooks now won’t just close the gap that attackers are exploiting today — they’ll be positioned to govern the autonomous identities arriving next. The test is whether those additions survive the next tabletop exercise. If they don’t hold up there, they won’t hold up in a real incident.",

          "standfirst": "Presidents’ Day is a great time to buy appliances, mattresses and furniture as they are often on sale for the holiday. Tech also gets discounted around this time, but you have to do a bit more digging to find actually good deals. And this year, Presidents’ Day comes right after Valentine’s Day and Super Bowl 2026, which means there are some overlapping sales to consider. If you don’t want to sort through the mess of bad deals out there, Engadget has you covered. We’re curating the best President Day sales on tech we can find right here. We’ll update this post through the holiday as more deals become available. Presidents’ Day deals under $50 Disney+ and Hulu bundle (one month) for $10 ($3 off): You can get one month of Disney+ and Hulu access for only $10 right now. That represents a small savings over the standard $13-per-month price for the bundle, but a 58-percent discount when you compare it to the price of paying for both services separately. It’s a good way to test out the bundle without paying too much before you decide if you want to subscribe for the long haul. Anker Nano 45W USB-C charger for $30 ($10 off, Prime exclusive): Anker’s latest 45W charger has a small smart display on it that can show you real-time charging stats. It’s compact design is great for travel, as are its foldable prongs. Waterpik cordless rechargeable water flosser for $40 (20 percent off): A water flosser like this one can make it easier (and less painful in some cases) to floss your teeth on the regular. This model from Waterpik includes two interchangeable tips and has two pressure settings. Its battery life should last up to four weeks with regular use as well. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 ($20 off): Amazon’s most premium streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Wi-Fi 6E. You may even be able to get it for $10 less than the sale price listed, for a final price of $30, when using the code MAX4KFTV at checkout.

          "content": "Presidents’ Day is a great time to buy appliances, mattresses and furniture as they are often on sale for the holiday. Tech also gets discounted around this time, but you have to do a bit more digging to find actually good deals. And this year, Presidents’ Day comes right after Valentine’s Day and Super Bowl 2026, which means there are some overlapping sales to consider. If you don’t want to sort through the mess of bad deals out there, Engadget has you covered. We’re curating the best President Day sales on tech we can find right here. We’ll update this post through the holiday as more deals become available. Presidents’ Day deals under $50 Disney+ and Hulu bundle (one month) for $10 ($3 off): You can get one month of Disney+ and Hulu access for only $10 right now. That represents a small savings over the standard $13-per-month price for the bundle, but a 58-percent discount when you compare it to the price of paying for both services separately. It’s a good way to test out the bundle without paying too much before you decide if you want to subscribe for the long haul. Anker Nano 45W USB-C charger for $30 ($10 off, Prime exclusive): Anker’s latest 45W charger has a small smart display on it that can show you real-time charging stats. It’s compact design is great for travel, as are its foldable prongs. Waterpik cordless rechargeable water flosser for $40 (20 percent off): A water flosser like this one can make it easier (and less painful in some cases) to floss your teeth on the regular. This model from Waterpik includes two interchangeable tips and has two pressure settings. Its battery life should last up to four weeks with regular use as well. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 ($20 off): Amazon’s most premium streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Wi-Fi 6E. You may even be able to get it for $10 less than the sale price listed, for a final price of $30, when using the code MAX4KFTV at checkout. Blink Mini 2K+ — 2 cameras for $45 (50 percent off): Blink’s latest plug-in security cameras support 2K video and improved audio quality.

The Apple Watch Series 11 is on sale for $299 for Presidents' Day, which is $100 off and the lowest price we've seen. A number of other Apple devices are on sale for the holiday as well. We named the Apple Watch Series 11 as our choice for best smartwatch overall. It scored a 90 in our review thanks to its 24 hours-plus of battery life and a thin, light design that's easy to wear. It also offers new health metrics, including Apple's hypertension alerts system and Sleep Score. The Apple Watch Series 11 deal is available on the 42mm case with a small/medium band. It also only includes GPS and four colorways: the Jet Black and Space Gray aluminum cases with a Black sport band, the Rose Gold aluminum case with a Light Blush sport band and the Silver aluminum case with a Purple Fog sport band. Among the other Presidents' Day Apple deals are mostly accessories: there are solid deals on AirPods, AirTags (the first-gen trackers, not the new, second-gen ones), the iPhone Air battery pack and even Apple's new crossbody straps that attach to the company's iPhone cases so you can essentially \"wear\" your iPhone like a bag. As with most Apple first-party accessories, you can find plenty of more affordable, third-party versions of them as alternatives. But if you're keen on outfitting your phone with Apple's own gear, it's best to wait for discounts like these.

          "title": "The creators of Mixtape want to make a great hangout video game",
          "standfirst": "For most adventure games, the long-term goal can often focus on solving a grand mystery or chasing a lost artifact of the past. But for the upcoming Mixtape, from publisher Annapurna Interactive, it sets its sights on the misadventures of young friends enjoying their last days together before moving on. It's the type of narrative adventure game that shines a light on how good music can bring people together, and how much fun getting into trouble can be. From developer Beethoven and Dinosaur, the Australian creative team behind The Artful Escape, Mixtape is, in many ways, a tribute to classic '90s Americana and an ode to the rebellious youth of the average suburb. I recently got to play the latest build of Mixtape and spoke with game director Johnny Galvatron about the making of their latest game. Along with sharing his favorite '80s and ’90s films that helped shape his vision, he also explained how tough yet rewarding it is to make \"idleness\" in video games compelling. \"Idleness is hard to explore as a video game, and one of the interesting things about being a teenager is you just hang out a lot, and sometimes it just sucks,\" said Galvatron. \"So I love that we made a game that shows that idleness.” “I think it can be a really hard balance to make something that is based on what is really a hangout film, something like Wayne's World or Richard Linklater's Dazed and Confused, but to have that be paced well and to be exciting for a video game was a real challenge.\" Set in the 1990s, Rockford and her friends Slater and Cassandra prepare for one last hurrah before heading into adulthood. With Rockford deciding to make a daring move to New York City to hopefully connect with her music idol, the crew reminisces on the good times they had going for late-night fast food runs, evading the police in shopping carts, and first kisses with their crushes – and all to the tune of their favorite songs. Beethoven & Dinosaur On the surface, Mixtape is an interactive coming-of-age story about a crew of rebellious teens, with memories serving as playable mini-games and interludes that capture their feelings at the time. But that's actually what makes this interactive trip down memory lane so compelling. These segments are presented as exaggerated memories of the past, fueled by the music of Devo, Joy Division, and Siouxsie and the Banshees. They’re emotional, poignant moments for these characters, tapping into the idea of how moments from our youth seemed bigger and grander than they actually were. One section I enjoyed playing was an interactive head-bobbing segment where the crew drove across town to get fast food. Different buttons corresponded to fist-pumping and head-bobbing actions, but there were no specific directions, so I just had to go with the flow. This scene was a great bit of comedy that showed off how goofy Rockford and her friends could get while vibing, but it was also a fun callback to films like Pulp Fiction, which used rear-projection sets to simulate car driving scenes (the memory even plays out on a film set). Another segment focused on a photo booth with Rockford and Slater, which put them in a position to capture the best or funniest shots. But it's not all fun and games with the crew. One segment focused on the friends tossing toilet paper rolls around their school principal's home, which quickly takes a turn for the worse when one of them decides to take the blame to spare Rockford from expulsion. It's a surprisingly heartfelt and sad moment, but it also foreshadows a simmering conflict for these characters. It's clear that Mixtape seeks to capture the experiences of a particular era, and that the developers themselves had a particular fondness for American movies and pop culture of the time. It captures the feeling of the so-called MTV generation and the intersection of media and the emotional expression of youth during this period. This is also evident in the game's use of a \"mixed media, liquid television\" editing style, which intercuts clips from TV shows and movies to emphasize emotional and comedic beats.. Rockford even does a Ferris Bueller-style narration for the players. Given that video game-to-movie adaptations have never been more popular, game director Johnny Galvatron has also had some talks about a potential movie adaptation. \"Obviously, Annapurna is also a film company, and they have those kinds of connections, and let me tell you, those meetings are fun as fuck,\" said the director. \"When people pitch you stuff, it's super cool. I would just say that, yes, I can see it coming. I would probably be totally hands-off on it.\" “When you develop video games, you should be changing them to work better within the medium,\" he continued. \"I think when they try to adhere too closely to the way a game works, that can sometimes break down. But yeah, I think if there were to be some adaptation stuff for Mixtape, probably, and I will stay clear of it.\" Beethoven & Dinosaur Mixtape feels like a heartfelt tribute to the '90s. While nostalgia bait is increasingly common these days, I felt there's a much deeper message under the hood, and getting to take part in these larger-than-life days of being a young adult has really got me excited for what's to come. I'm hoping the final game will deliver an adventure where I can really savor those listless hangouts with friends. Mixtape is set to be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S later this year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-creators-of-mixtape-want-to-make-a-great-hangout-video-game-140026928.html?src=rss",

          "title": "The best gaming handhelds for 2026",
          "standfirst": "Handheld gaming systems aren’t niche anymore. Today’s devices range from compact devices built around retro emulation to full-fledged portable PCs capable of running modern AAA games. That variety is exciting, but it also makes shopping harder. The “best” gaming handheld now depends less on a single, standout device and more on how, where and what you want to play.Some handhelds are designed for quick sessions and classic libraries, prioritizing simplicity, long battery life and pocketable designs. Others blur the line between console and PC, offering large screens, powerful chips and access to massive game libraries, often at the cost of size, price or endurance. There are even more experimental options that focus on unusual controls or intentionally limited experiences.We’ve spent months testing and tracking the fast-moving handheld space to figure out which devices are actually worth your money right now. Whether you’re looking for a versatile all-rounder, a premium portable gaming PC or a dedicated machine for retro games, these are the gaming handhelds that stand out in an increasingly crowded field.Editor’s note (11/7/25): A barrage of new mobile emulation handhelds have been announced since our last update, including two follow-ups to our current “best for most” pick (the Retroid Pocket 6 and the more marginally updated Retroid Pocket G2) and a new version of our “best overall” pick (the AYN Odin 3). Other competitors like Ayaneo’s KONKR Pocket Fit are also on the way, and there’s been a wave of new dual-screen models like the AYN Thor, Ayaneo Pocket DS and Anbernic RG DS. We think our current recommendations will still satisfy most shoppers, but since we’re still working to test most of these newer devices, we wanted to give a heads-up for anyone who wants the absolute latest. In the meantime, we’ve added testing notes on a few other emulation-focused handhelds as well as a couple new portable PCs like the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X. Best handheld gaming devices for 2026 What about the Nintendo Switch 2? Sam Rutherford for Engadget Read our full Nintendo Switch 2 review The new Nintendo Switch 2 is already more popular than any of the handhelds above, but we haven’t made it a formal pick in this guide since it exists in its own world. As one of the newest devices from the big three console manufacturers, most people aren’t choosing between it and the handheld PCs or emulation devices above. The main reason to buy a Switch 2 is to play new Nintendo games, and no other device can (legally) offer that. Likewise, the Switch 2 doesn’t even try to offer the flexibility of a Steam Deck, ROG Ally X or even the Retroid Pocket 5. That said, the hardware itself is a significant upgrade over its predecessor, with dramatically improved performance, a sharper, faster and bigger 7.9-inch display, magnetic Joy-Con controllers and more storage. It’s a wholly more polished take on the Switch 1’s ideas. Does that make it a must-buy right now? Unless you’re worried about a tariff-induced price hike — which may not be the most outlandish fear — not really. Donkey Kong Bananza is a joy, Mario Kart World is fun enough and playing Cyberpunk 2077 on a Nintendo console is kind of surreal, but the list of true must-plays that are exclusive to the Switch 2 is still limited. That’s OK — it’s only been a few months. But don’t feel like you must rush out and splash the cash today unless you have a serious case of Donkey Kong-induced FOMO. Other gaming handhelds we've tested The Lenovo Legion Go 2. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Note: This is a selection of noteworthy gaming handhelds we’ve tested, not a comprehensive list of everything we've ever tried. Lenovo Legion Go 2 The Lenovo Legion Go 2 is a capable alternative to the ROG Xbox Ally X with a mondo-sized 8.8-inch display. That screen is the main reason to consider it, as it’s a vivid OLED panel that supports VRR and has a 144Hz native refresh rate. Like the Switch, it also comes with detachable controllers — one of which includes a useful touchpad for navigating Windows — plus a built-in kickstand for tabletop play. That said, it’s an absolute tank at just over two pounds, and we found it to perform a little worse than the Xbox Ally X at equal settings. It’s also even more expensive, starting at $1,100 and rising to $1,350 for a config with the same Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip. It’s a lovely device if you’ve got cash to burn — and to be fair, none of these Windows handhelds are for anyone looking for “value” — but the Xbox Ally X is a better buy for most. The MSI Claw 8 AI+. Sam Rutherford for Engadget MSI Claw 8 AI+ The original MSI Claw was a flop, but the newer Claw 8 AI+ is much more appealing if you’re willing to pay for a larger and slightly more powerful alternative to the ASUS ROG Ally X. With its Intel Core Ultra 7-258V chip and 32GB of RAM, it typically pumped out 10 to 15 percent higher frame rates than last-gen models like the ROG Ally X and Lenovo Legion Go in our testing. (Another model is available with the Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip.) Battery life is relatively strong, while its 8-inch 120Hz IPS display is plenty bright and supports VRR. There are smooth Hall effect thumbsticks and triggers, two Thunderbolt 4 ports and a built-in fingerprint sensor beyond that. The Claw’s main issue is its price: At $1,100 after recent price hikes, it’s hard to justify over the ROG Xbox Ally X, which is already too expensive for most people. ASUS' handheld is lighter and easier to grip on top of that — though the Claw is thinner — and its overhauled Xbox UI, while far from perfect, is still easier to get around than MSI’s Center M hub. There's a smaller 7-inch version of this handheld for $900 as well, but we haven’t tested that one. The ModRetro Chromatic. Jeff Dunn for Engadget ModRetro Chromatic The ModRetro Chromatic is a competitor to the Analogue Pocket that can similarly play actual Game Boy cartridges via FPGA. With its premium metal frame, loud speaker, tight d-pad and beautifully bright 2.56-inch display, it’s an impressive modernization of Nintendo’s classic handheld. ModRetro also publishes a number of games specifically for the device, including a pretty great version of Tetris that comes bundled in the box. However, for many, its faithfulness to the original Game Boy probably goes too far: It requires three AA batteries for power, and unlike the Analogue Pocket it doesn’t support custom save states. It’s also designed for Game Boy and Game Boy Color games only; it can’t play any Game Boy Advance cartridges or games from other retro handhelds like Analogue’s device, nor does doesn’t support ROMs. For only $20 less than the Pocket, that makes it a tough sell, even if the hardware is arguably higher-quality. There’s also the lethal, autonomous elephant in the room: ModRetro is founded by Palmer Luckey, the idiosyncratic entrepreneur behind the Oculus Rift who has gone on to form Anduril Industries, a defense contractor that makes drones, surveillance systems and other AI-powered military tech. He has also espoused political views that many people — and this is the tamest way I can put this — may not be comfortable backing. We are not here to police where you can spend your money, and the Chromatic does much of what it wants to do well. Still, all of these handhelds are just so inessential, and no other option that we know of is as closely tied to an arms dealer. The Lenovo Legion Go S. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Lenovo Legion Go S (Windows, Z2 Go chip) The Windows 11 version of the Lenovo Legion Go S has the same relatively comfortable design and commendable 8-inch 120Hz display as the SteamOS model we highlight above. With the Z2 Go model we tested, though, its performance lags too far behind the ROG Ally X, Claw 8 AI+ and original Legion Go for something priced at $730. Windows is still clunky, too. The Ayaneo Flip DS. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Ayaneo Flip DS The Ayaneo Flip DS is a cool concept: a powerful Windows machine with a clamshell design and dual displays, sort of like a supercharged Nintendo DS. It feels sturdy, it performs roughly on par with the other Ryzen 7 7840U (or 8840U) handhelds in this guide, and its 7-inch top display is sharp, fast and bright. The second screen makes it a natural fit for emulating Wii U or 3DS games, but you could also, say, look up a guide or play a YouTube video without having to close whatever you’re playing. Unfortunately, this is more of a neat idea than a fully thought-out product. The folding design means that the joysticks have to be short and recessed, while the face buttons and d-pad are uncomfortably flat. The whole thing is overly thick and heavy, plus it runs very hot. Battery life tops out around two hours, and actually managing two displays on a Windows handheld is about as clunky as you'd expect. With prices now starting above $1,100, the Flip DS is hard to recommend unless you’re (oddly) desperate for a handheld Wii U emulator. We're always happy to see more weird hardware, though. The Ayaneo Kun. Photo by James Trew / Engadget Ayaneo Kun The Ayaneo Kun is one of the more decadent Windows handhelds we’ve tested. With a sharp 8.4-inch display, a Ryzen 7 8840U chip, up to 64GB of RAM, up to 4TB of storage, a sizable 75Whr battery and a 54W max TDP, it’s both a capable gaming device and a feasible replacement for a desktop PC. But it now starts at a pricey $999, it’s huge and it suffers from the usual Windows-related issues. It also lacks VRR, and that Ryzen chip is no longer the latest and greatest. The Kun is still a fine device in a vacuum, but the ROG Xbox Ally X is a better buy. This is technically an older model for Ayaneo, too, as the company seems to launch a new handheld every other hour these days. The Retroid Pocket Classic. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Retroid Pocket Classic The Retroid Pocket Classic is another Game Boy-style vertical handheld in the vein of the Analogue Pocket, but like the other Retroid models we’ve highlighted, it’s an Android device designed to emulate games via ROM files, not genuine cartridges. (Naturally, it can also play native Android games.) It’s still far clunkier to set up and use as a result, and its overall design feels more toy-like than either the Pocket or ModRetro Chromatic. But its Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 chip is easily powerful enough to play any classic handheld system (along with most other retro games that don’t require joystick controls), while its 3.9-inch OLED display is superbly bright, sharp and colorful. The battery can last more than 10 hours when emulating lower-power systems, and Retroid sells a version with six face buttons instead of the standard four if you want to play older Sega Genesis and Saturn games in particular. The Analogue Pocket is still more premium and rewarding to use, but if you want a similar form factor and can live with the typical quirks that come with a device like this, the Classic is a good value at $129. Of the many Game Boy-style handhelds out there that solely rely on software emulation, it’s the one we’d recommend first. The Retroid Pocket Mini (bottom) and Retroid Pocket 5. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Retroid Pocket Mini The Retroid Pocket Mini is essentially a smaller version of the Retroid Pocket 5. It runs on the same Snapdragon 865 chip and feels just as sturdy, but it has a smaller 3.92-inch display with a 4:3 aspect ratio. This makes it a more natural fit for older retro consoles, as you won’t get the black boxes you’d see on a 16:9 display like the one on the Pocket 5. If you mainly want to emulate systems like the SNES, Sega Genesis or Game Boy Color and don’t mind paying extra for a rich OLED display, it’s a good little device. But the tiny screen is limiting if you ever want to play newer games, and we wish there wasn't so much empty space around the display. This device had also generated some controversy within the retro gaming community for having persistent issues with inaccurate shaders (and for the slapdash way Retroid handled the matter). The company replaced the original model with a \"V2\" iteration that addresses those concerns, however. Retroid Pocket 4 Pro and Retroid Pocket 4 The 4.7-inch Retroid Pocket 4 Pro is the predecessor to the Pocket 5. Its performance isn’t significantly far off the newer model, so it remains a nice value if you’re determined to spend less than $200 on an emulation device. It misses out on the larger OLED display and more ergonomically-friendly design of its follow-up, however. The base Pocket 4 may also be worth a look if you want to stay under $150, but its weaker chip makes it less adept at emulating games from the PS2, GameCube and up. The Miyoo Mini Plus (left) and TrimUI Brick. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Miyoo Mini Plus The Miyoo Mini Plus is a highly affordable handheld with a well-built, Game Boy-style form factor that fits nicely with older games. Its 3.5-inch display pops for something in the $60 to $80 range, its battery lasts as long as it needs to and it can emulate consoles up to the original PlayStation without much issue. Its Linux-based software is extensively customizable, though it requires some tinkering to get it working optimally. Like many cheapo handhelds, it also lacks fast charging. Since it’s from a smaller Chinese firm and isn’t available at major retailers, it can also be difficult to actually buy. It's a nice choice if you want something more compact than the Retroid Pocket Classic, but that model's roomier design, more vibrant OLED panel and longer battery life makes it worth the extra cash for most people. TrimUI Brick The TrimUI Brick is another low-cost vertical handheld that’s surprisingly well-built for an $80-ish device, thanks to its brushed metal backplate and impressive 3.2-inch IPS display. It has a weaker chip than the Retroid Pocket Classic, but it can still emulate older handheld games just fine, and its tiny frame makes it much easier to actually fit in a pocket. That said, while it has a sharper and more vivid screen than the Miyoo Mini Plus (its closest rival), the face buttons, d-pad and especially back buttons are all stiffer, and its stock UI feels similarly bootleg. (Some of the icons for different systems in the game library: “GomeBuy,” “Fanicon,” and “PloyStotion.”) You can fix the latter with custom firmware, but Retroid’s interface is easier to grok by default, and its setup process is less annoying. Most people interested in this class of device will be happier paying up for the Pocket Classic instead. The Anbernic RG35XX Plus. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Anbernic RG35XX Plus The Anbernic RG35XX Plus is another wallet-friendly vertical handheld. For about the same price as the Miyoo Mini Plus, it offers a faster chipset, more RAM and a bigger battery alongside a similarly impressive design. Its stock OS is overly sloppy and cheap-looking, however, and while its stronger chip is appreciated, it's still far behind the Retroid Pocket Classic. The Anbernic RG35XXSP. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Anbernic RG35XXSP The Anbernic RG35XXSP is a variant of the RG35XX Plus based on the same internals, only it apes the clamshell form factor of the old Game Boy Advance SP. That’s a great design to rip off if you must pick one, and the hardware doesn’t feel nearly as cheap as its (pre-tariff) price tag of $60 or so would suggest. But the software issues noted above still apply (both here and with the many other devices in the same RGXX family). We’ve also seen several user reports of quality control issues with the RG35XXSP’s battery, which is automatically disqualifying. Anbernic RG405M The Anbernic RG405M is another 4:3 handheld with a 4-inch display and a pleasing metal frame. It's an OK alternative to the Retroid Pocket Mini if you want a little more screen space for less cash, but it’s slower, and it lacks the Mini’s OLED display. We find the Retroid’s grooved back to be comfier to hold over time as well. And again, Anbernic has paused handheld shipments to America as of this writing. The PlayStation Portal. Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget PlayStation Portal The PlayStation Portal is an odd accessory that’s designed to stream games from a PlayStation 5. It lacks built-in apps, so it doesn’t support traditional emulation. Because it’s entirely dependent on the quality of your home Wi-Fi, we can’t guarantee how well it’ll actually perform. It doesn’t work with Bluetooth earbuds either. The 8-inch display is fine and the DualSense-style controls are great, so PlayStation diehards who want a second screen for local PS5 streaming may see the appeal. Sony recently added the ability to stream a selection of games via the cloud, which is a step in the right direction, but you need an expensive PlayStation Plus Premium subscription to take advantage. In general, there’s little here that you can’t do with a smartphone and mobile game controller, so most people are better off saving their $200. Logitech G Cloud The Logitech G Cloud would’ve been a great Android pick when it launched if it cost about $150 less. Its 7-inch 1080p display is bright, vibrant and generally more pleasing to look at than the panel on the AYN Odin 2, its battery lasts a good 10 to 12 hours per charge and its design is comfy to hold for hours at a time. Alas, the G Cloud still tends to retail for $300, which is just too much when the Retroid Pocket 5 offers more power at a lower price. What to know about the gaming handheld market Jeff Dunn / Engadget You can break down the gaming handheld market into three broad tiers. At the top, you have x86-based portable gaming PCs like the Steam Deck or ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X. These are the most powerful handhelds you can buy, as they seek to replicate the experience of a moderately specced gaming desktop. The Steam Deck runs on Linux, but most others use Windows. If you want to play modern, recently released PC games on the go (and need something stronger than a Switch), this is the type of device you’d get. They can also emulate the widest range of retro consoles. They’re typically the largest and most cumbersome devices to hold, however, and their battery life can be short. Naturally, they’re also the most expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to more than $1,000. Further down on the price spectrum are \"mobile handhelds\" like the Logitech G Cloud or Retroid Pocket. These devices often run Android or Linux and can range from under $50 to $400-ish (before tariffs). They aren’t equipped to play modern console or PC titles, but they’re usually more compact than a portable PC, and you can still use them for mobile games and cloud streaming. While most are marketed toward those ends, many gamers actually buy them to emulate classic games through software like RetroArch. Getting emulators to work can be complicated, and accessing the BIOS and ROM files required to play games this way is legally murky. One lawsuit from Nintendo led to the shutdown of the most prominent Switch and 3DS emulators, for instance. (Engadget does not condone piracy.) Backing up files of games you already own for personal use only is considered more defensible, though, so for that a mobile handheld can be a more user- and wallet-friendly way to play the classics — provided you don’t want to just use your phone. We’ll call the last tier “handhelds that do their own thing.” This is a catch-all for things like the Switch 2 or Playdate: portable devices that run heavily customized software and aim to provide a unique gaming experience. They aren’t necessarily ideal for emulation or playing the latest multiplatform titles; instead, they often have distinct game libraries. They might not have the widest appeal as a result (Switch excluded), but they’re often easier for less tech-literate folks to just pick up and use. Recent updates November 2025: The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X replaces the older ROG Ally X as our new favorite Windows gaming handheld. We’ve also added testing notes on the Lenovo Legion Go 2, ModRetro Chromatic and a couple of emulation-based handhelds in the Retroid Pocket Classic and TrimUI Brick. We’re working to test several other recent releases for our next update, including updated versions of the Retroid Pocket 5 and AYN Odin 2. August 2025: We’ve added the SteamOS version of the Lenovo Legion Go S as a new recommendation and updated our top Windows pick to reflect the upcoming release of ASUS’ and Microsoft’s ROG Xbox Ally devices, which will feature an overhauled Windows UI. We’ve also added a note on the recently released Nintendo Switch 2. We’ll include testing notes on the Retroid Pocket Classic, TrimUI Brick and ModRetro Chromatic in the near future. (Note: Yours truly went on paternity leave after our last update — apologies for the delay!) May 2025: We’ve tested the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 and recommended it as an alternative to the Retroid Pocket 5. We’re also watching out for the first third-party devices that run SteamOS, starting with the new Lenovo Legion Go S, and the next ASUS ROG Ally device, which seems to be arriving soon based on recent leaks. March 2025: We’ve edited this guide for clarity and added testing notes for the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Lenovo Legion Go S (Windows version). Our main picks are unchanged. Looking ahead, we’re keeping an eye on upcoming Windows handhelds from Acer and Ayaneo, a pair of new emulation devices from Retroid, the first third-party devices to ship with SteamOS and more machines that run on AMD’s Ryzen Z2 chips, among others. January 2025: We have a new top pick among emulation-focused handhelds: the Retroid Pocket 5. Beyond that, we’ve added notes on a few other devices we’ve tested, including the Retroid Pocket Mini and Anbernic RG35XXSP; lightly edited other blurbs to reflect changes in the market; and removed a couple write-ups for products that’ve been discontinued. We're also keeping an eye on new handhelds that’ve recently been announced or are strongly rumored to arrive in the near future, including devices from MSI and Lenovo. August 2024: We’ve replaced the ASUS ROG Ally, our prior pick for the best Windows gaming handheld, with the new and improved ROG Ally X. We’ve also checked to make sure all availability and pricing details noted throughout the guide are accurate. June 2024: We’ve updated this guide to ensure all of our recommendations are up to date, adding a note on ASUS’ upcoming ROG Ally X in the process. We’ve also included details on two new handhelds we’ve tested since our previous update: the MSI Claw and Ayaneo Flip DS. Staying on top of this market is a tall task, but we’re currently looking at recent noteworthy releases like the PSP-esque AYN Odin 2 Mini and the GBA-style Anbernic RG35XXSP as well.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/best-handheld-gaming-system-140018863.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Handheld gaming systems aren’t niche anymore. Today’s devices range from compact devices built around retro emulation to full-fledged portable PCs capable of running modern AAA games. That variety is exciting, but it also makes shopping harder. The “best” gaming handheld now depends less on a single, standout device and more on how, where and what you want to play.Some handhelds are designed for quick sessions and classic libraries, prioritizing simplicity, long battery life and pocketable designs. Others blur the line between console and PC, offering large screens, powerful chips and access to massive game libraries, often at the cost of size, price or endurance.

But the tiny screen is limiting if you ever want to play newer games, and we wish there wasn't so much empty space around the display. This device had also generated some controversy within the retro gaming community for having persistent issues with inaccurate shaders (and for the slapdash way Retroid handled the matter). The company replaced the original model with a \"V2\" iteration that addresses those concerns, however. Retroid Pocket 4 Pro and Retroid Pocket 4 The 4.7-inch Retroid Pocket 4 Pro is the predecessor to the Pocket 5. Its performance isn’t significantly far off the newer model, so it remains a nice value if you’re determined to spend less than $200 on an emulation device. It misses out on the larger OLED display and more ergonomically-friendly design of its follow-up, however. The base Pocket 4 may also be worth a look if you want to stay under $150, but its weaker chip makes it less adept at emulating games from the PS2, GameCube and up. The Miyoo Mini Plus (left) and TrimUI Brick. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Miyoo Mini Plus The Miyoo Mini Plus is a highly affordable handheld with a well-built, Game Boy-style form factor that fits nicely with older games. Its 3.5-inch display pops for something in the $60 to $80 range, its battery lasts as long as it needs to and it can emulate consoles up to the original PlayStation without much issue. Its Linux-based software is extensively customizable, though it requires some tinkering to get it working optimally. Like many cheapo handhelds, it also lacks fast charging. Since it’s from a smaller Chinese firm and isn’t available at major retailers, it can also be difficult to actually buy. It's a nice choice if you want something more compact than the Retroid Pocket Classic, but that model's roomier design, more vibrant OLED panel and longer battery life makes it worth the extra cash for most people. TrimUI Brick The TrimUI Brick is another low-cost vertical handheld that’s surprisingly well-built for an $80-ish device, thanks to its brushed metal backplate and impressive 3.2-inch IPS display. It has a weaker chip than the Retroid Pocket Classic, but it can still emulate older handheld games just fine, and its tiny frame makes it much easier to actually fit in a pocket. That said, while it has a sharper and more vivid screen than the Miyoo Mini Plus (its closest rival), the face buttons, d-pad and especially back buttons are all stiffer, and its stock UI feels similarly bootleg. (Some of the icons for different systems in the game library: “GomeBuy,” “Fanicon,” and “PloyStotion.”) You can fix the latter with custom firmware, but Retroid’s interface is easier to grok by default, and its setup process is less annoying. Most people interested in this class of device will be happier paying up for the Pocket Classic instead. The Anbernic RG35XX Plus. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Anbernic RG35XX Plus The Anbernic RG35XX Plus is another wallet-friendly vertical handheld. For about the same price as the Miyoo Mini Plus, it offers a faster chipset, more RAM and a bigger battery alongside a similarly impressive design. Its stock OS is overly sloppy and cheap-looking, however, and while its stronger chip is appreciated, it's still far behind the Retroid Pocket Classic. The Anbernic RG35XXSP. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Anbernic RG35XXSP The Anbernic RG35XXSP is a variant of the RG35XX Plus based on the same internals, only it apes the clamshell form factor of the old Game Boy Advance SP. That’s a great design to rip off if you must pick one, and the hardware doesn’t feel nearly as cheap as its (pre-tariff) price tag of $60 or so would suggest. But the software issues noted above still apply (both here and with the many other devices in the same RGXX family). We’ve also seen several user reports of quality control issues with the RG35XXSP’s battery, which is automatically disqualifying. Anbernic RG405M The Anbernic RG405M is another 4:3 handheld with a 4-inch display and a pleasing metal frame. It's an OK alternative to the Retroid Pocket Mini if you want a little more screen space for less cash, but it’s slower, and it lacks the Mini’s OLED display. We find the Retroid’s grooved back to be comfier to hold over time as well. And again, Anbernic has paused handheld shipments to America as of this writing. The PlayStation Portal. Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget PlayStation Portal The PlayStation Portal is an odd accessory that’s designed to stream games from a PlayStation 5. It lacks built-in apps, so it doesn’t support traditional emulation. Because it’s entirely dependent on the quality of your home Wi-Fi, we can’t guarantee how well it’ll actually perform. It doesn’t work with Bluetooth earbuds either. The 8-inch display is fine and the DualSense-style controls are great, so PlayStation diehards who want a second screen for local PS5 streaming may see the appeal. Sony recently added the ability to stream a selection of games via the cloud, which is a step in the right direction, but you need an expensive PlayStation Plus Premium subscription to take advantage. In general, there’s little here that you can’t do with a smartphone and mobile game controller, so most people are better off saving their $200. Logitech G Cloud The Logitech G Cloud would’ve been a great Android pick when it launched if it cost about $150 less. Its 7-inch 1080p display is bright, vibrant and generally more pleasing to look at than the panel on the AYN Odin 2, its battery lasts a good 10 to 12 hours per charge and its design is comfy to hold for hours at a time. Alas, the G Cloud still tends to retail for $300, which is just too much when the Retroid Pocket 5 offers more power at a lower price. What to know about the gaming handheld market Jeff Dunn / Engadget You can break down the gaming handheld market into three broad tiers. At the top, you have x86-based portable gaming PCs like the Steam Deck or ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X. These are the most powerful handhelds you can buy, as they seek to replicate the experience of a moderately specced gaming desktop. The Steam Deck runs on Linux, but most others use Windows. If you want to play modern, recently released PC games on the go (and need something stronger than a Switch), this is the type of device you’d get. They can also emulate the widest range of retro consoles. They’re typically the largest and most cumbersome devices to hold, however, and their battery life can be short. Naturally, they’re also the most expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to more than $1,000. Further down on the price spectrum are \"mobile handhelds\" like the Logitech G Cloud or Retroid Pocket. These devices often run Android or Linux and can range from under $50 to $400-ish (before tariffs). They aren’t equipped to play modern console or PC titles, but they’re usually more compact than a portable PC, and you can still use them for mobile games and cloud streaming. While most are marketed toward those ends, many gamers actually buy them to emulate classic games through software like RetroArch. Getting emulators to work can be complicated, and accessing the BIOS and ROM files required to play games this way is legally murky. One lawsuit from Nintendo led to the shutdown of the most prominent Switch and 3DS emulators, for instance. (Engadget does not condone piracy.) Backing up files of games you already own for personal use only is considered more defensible, though, so for that a mobile handheld can be a more user- and wallet-friendly way to play the classics — provided you don’t want to just use your phone. We’ll call the last tier “handhelds that do their own thing.” This is a catch-all for things like the Switch 2 or Playdate: portable devices that run heavily customized software and aim to provide a unique gaming experience. They aren’t necessarily ideal for emulation or playing the latest multiplatform titles; instead, they often have distinct game libraries. They might not have the widest appeal as a result (Switch excluded), but they’re often easier for less tech-literate folks to just pick up and use. Recent updates November 2025: The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X replaces the older ROG Ally X as our new favorite Windows gaming handheld. We’ve also added testing notes on the Lenovo Legion Go 2, ModRetro Chromatic and a couple of emulation-based handhelds in the Retroid Pocket Classic and TrimUI Brick. We’re working to test several other recent releases for our next update, including updated versions of the Retroid Pocket 5 and AYN Odin 2. August 2025: We’ve added the SteamOS version of the Lenovo Legion Go S as a new recommendation and updated our top Windows pick to reflect the upcoming release of ASUS’ and Microsoft’s ROG Xbox Ally devices, which will feature an overhauled Windows UI. We’ve also added a note on the recently released Nintendo Switch 2. We’ll include testing notes on the Retroid Pocket Classic, TrimUI Brick and ModRetro Chromatic in the near future. (Note: Yours truly went on paternity leave after our last update — apologies for the delay!) May 2025: We’ve tested the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 and recommended it as an alternative to the Retroid Pocket 5. We’re also watching out for the first third-party devices that run SteamOS, starting with the new Lenovo Legion Go S, and the next ASUS ROG Ally device, which seems to be arriving soon based on recent leaks. March 2025: We’ve edited this guide for clarity and added testing notes for the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Lenovo Legion Go S (Windows version). Our main picks are unchanged. Looking ahead, we’re keeping an eye on upcoming Windows handhelds from Acer and Ayaneo, a pair of new emulation devices from Retroid, the first third-party devices to ship with SteamOS and more machines that run on AMD’s Ryzen Z2 chips, among others. January 2025: We have a new top pick among emulation-focused handhelds: the Retroid Pocket 5. Beyond that, we’ve added notes on a few other devices we’ve tested, including the Retroid Pocket Mini and Anbernic RG35XXSP; lightly edited other blurbs to reflect changes in the market; and removed a couple write-ups for products that’ve been discontinued. We're also keeping an eye on new handhelds that’ve recently been announced or are strongly rumored to arrive in the near future, including devices from MSI and Lenovo. August 2024: We’ve replaced the ASUS ROG Ally, our prior pick for the best Windows gaming handheld, with the new and improved ROG Ally X. We’ve also checked to make sure all availability and pricing details noted throughout the guide are accurate. June 2024: We’ve updated this guide to ensure all of our recommendations are up to date, adding a note on ASUS’ upcoming ROG Ally X in the process. We’ve also included details on two new handhelds we’ve tested since our previous update: the MSI Claw and Ayaneo Flip DS. Staying on top of this market is a tall task, but we’re currently looking at recent noteworthy releases like the PSP-esque AYN Odin 2 Mini and the GBA-style Anbernic RG35XXSP as well.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/best-handheld-gaming-system-140018863.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "A few years ago, it may have been fashionable to spend $1,000 on the latest flagship smartphone, but for most people, that’s neither practical nor necessary. You don't even have to spend $500 today to get a decent handset, whether it’s a refurbished iPhone or an affordable Android phone, as there are plenty of decent options as low as $160.However, navigating the budget phone market can be tricky; options that look good on paper may not be in practice, and some devices will end up costing you more when you consider many come with restrictive storage. While we spend most of our time reviewing mid- to high-end handsets at Engadget, we've tested a number of the latest budget-friendly phones on the market to see cut it as the best cheap phones you can get right now. Best cheap phones What to look for in a cheap phone For this guide, our top picks cost between $100 and $300. Anything less and you might as well go buy a dumb phone instead. Since they’re meant to be more affordable than flagship phones and even midrange handsets, budget smartphones involve compromises; the cheaper a device, the lower your expectations around specs, performance and experience should be. For that reason, the best advice I can give is to spend as much as you can afford. In this price range, even $50 or $100 more can get you a dramatically better product. Second, you should know what you want most from a phone. When buying a budget smartphone, you may need to sacrifice a decent main camera for long battery life, or trade a high-resolution display for a faster CPU. That’s just what comes with the territory, but knowing your priorities will make it easier to find the right phone. It’s also worth noting some features can be hard to find on cheaper handsets. For instance, you won’t need to search far for a device with all-day battery life — but if you want a phone with excellent camera quality, you’re better off shelling out for one of the recommendations in our midrange smartphone guide, which all come in at $600 or less. Wireless charging and waterproofing also aren’t easy to find in this price range and forget about the fastest chipset. On the bright side, most of our recommendations come with headphone jacks, so you won’t need to buy wireless headphones. iOS is also off the table, since, following the discontinuation of the iPhone SE, the $599 iPhone 16e is now the most affordable offering from Apple. That leaves Android as the only option in the under-$300 price range. Thankfully today, there’s little to complain about Google’s operating system – and you may even prefer it to iOS. Lastly, keep in mind most Android manufacturers typically offer far less robust software features and support for their budget devices. In some cases, your new phone may only receive one major software update and a year or two of security patches beyond that. That applies to the OnePlus and Motorola recommendations on our list. If you’d like to keep your phone for as long as possible, Samsung has the best software policy of any Android manufacturer in the budget space, offering at least four years of security updates on all of its devices. Recently, it even began offering six years of support on the $200 A16 5G, which we recommend below. That said, if software support (or device longevity overall) is your main focus, consider spending a bit more on the $500 Google Pixel 9a, or even the previous-gen Pixel 8a, which has planned software updates through mid-2031.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-cheap-phones-130017793.html?src=rss",

Hong Kong-based GameSir has primarily made a name for itself as a manufacturer of gaming peripherals—the company's social media profile includes a self-description as \"the Anti-Stick Drift Experts.\" Early last year, though, GameSir rolled out the Android GameHub app, which includes a GameFusion emulator that the company claims \"provides complete support for Windows games to run on Android through high-precision compatibility design.\" In practice, GameHub and GameFusion for Android haven't quite lived up to that promise. Testers on Reddit and sites like EmuReady report hit-or-miss compatibility for popular Steam titles on various Android-based handhelds. At least one Reddit user suggests that \"any Unity, Godot, or Game Maker game tends to just work\" through the app, while another reports \"terrible compatibility\" across a wide range of games.Read full article Comments",

They store not only passwords for pension, financial, and email accounts, but often cryptocurrency credentials, payment card numbers, and other sensitive data. All eight of the top password managers have adopted the term “zero knowledge” to describe the complex encryption system they use to protect the data vaults that users store on their servers. The definitions vary slightly from vendor to vendor, but they generally boil down to one bold assurance: that there is no way for malicious insiders or hackers who manage to compromise the cloud infrastructure to steal vaults or data stored in them. These promises make sense, given previous breaches of LastPass and the reasonable expectation that state-level hackers have both the motive and capability to obtain password vaults belonging to high-value targets. A bold assurance debunked Typical of these claims are those made by Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass, which together are used by roughly 60 million people. Bitwarden, for example, says that “not even the team at Bitwarden can read your data (even if we wanted to).” Dashlane, meanwhile, says that without a user’s master password, “malicious actors can’t steal the information, even if Dashlane’s servers are compromised.” LastPass says that no one can access the “data stored in your LastPass vault, except you (not even LastPass).”Read full article Comments",

Talarico \"was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,\" Colbert said on last night's episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. \"Then I was told in some uncertain terms that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on, and because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this.\" Colbert went on to describe some of the background Ars readers are already familiar with. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr recently issued a warning to late-night and daytime talk shows that they may no longer qualify for the bona fide news exemption to the equal-time rule, and subsequently opened an investigation into ABC’s The View after an interview with Talarico.Read full article Comments",

Today, CloudBolt Software released a report, \"The Mass Exodus That Never Was: The Squeeze Is Just Beginning,\" that provides insight into those struggles. CloudBolt is a hybrid cloud management platform provider that aims to identify VMware customers’ pain points so it can sell them relevant solutions. In the report, CloudBolt said it surveyed 302 IT decision-makers (director-level or higher) at North American companies with at least 1,000 employees in January. The survey is far from comprehensive, but it offers a look at the obstacles these users face. Broadcom closed its VMware acquisition in November 2023, and last month, 88 percent of survey respondents still described the change as “disruptive.” Per the survey, the most cited drivers of disruption were price increases (named by 89 percent of respondents), followed by uncertainty about Broadcom’s plans (85 percent), support quality concerns (78 percent), Broadcom shifting VMware from perpetual licenses to subscriptions (72 percent), changes to VMware’s partner program (68 percent), and the forced bundling of products (65 percent).Read full article Comments",

Valve had added a note to its Steam Deck page noting that the device would be \"out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages.\" None of Valve's three listed Steam Deck configurations are currently available to buy, nor are any of the certified refurbished Steam Deck configurations that Valve sometimes offers. Valve hasn't announced any price increases for the Deck, at least not yet—the 512GB OLED model is still listed at $549 and the 1TB version at $649. But the basic 256GB LCD model has been formally discontinued now that it has sold out, increasing the Deck's de facto starting price from $399 to $549. Valve announced in December that it was ending production on the LCD version of the Deck and that it wouldn't be restocked once it sold out.Read full article Comments",

As vehicles become platforms for software and subscriptions, their longevity is increasingly tied to the survival of the companies behind their code. When those companies fail, the consequences ripple far beyond a bad app update and into the basic question of whether a car still functions as a car. Over the years, automotive software has expanded from performing rudimentary engine management and onboard diagnostics to powering today’s interconnected, software-defined vehicles. Smartphone apps can now handle tasks like unlocking doors, flashing headlights, and preconditioning cabins—and some models won’t unlock at all unless a phone running the manufacturer’s app is within range.Read full article Comments",

Australia, Canada, Germany, and Spain are among the nations that currently lack the ability to independently put their own satellites into orbit but which are now spending money to establish a domestic launch industry. Others talk a big game but haven't committed the cash to back up their ambitions. The moves are part of a wider trend among US allies to increase defense spending amid strained relations with the Trump administration. Tariffs, trade wars, and threats to invade the territory of a NATO ally have changed the tune of many foreign leaders.

When you think about what makes a perfect single-car garage—occupied solely by a vehicle that can do it all—you probably think of some crossover or SUV like the Toyota RAV4 or BMW X5. Something that can handle the snow and weekend camping trips with a decent-sized cargo capacity. If you're European, you might gravitate toward a wagon like any of the Volvo Cross Country models or an Allroad from Audi. For a long time, Subaru offered a near-perfect solution in the Outback, but the new one is much more SUV than wagon. That left an opening for Toyota to swoop in, and the bZ Woodland is not only the best take on the Subaru Outback I've driven, but the nearly perfect single-car solution for the electric age. What makes it a Woodland? The bZ Woodland is a lifted wagon electric vehicle that is 6 inches longer than the non-Woodland bZ and has 33.8 cubic feet (957 L) of rear cargo space. That, on paper, is 6.1 more cubes (173 L) of storage with the second row in place but in practice feels even more spacious. The Woodland also has 8.3 inches (211 mm) of ground clearance, which is up one-tenth (2.5 mm) over the normal bZ. But like the cargo space, how the bZ Woodland uses those extra numbers is what makes it feel so different.Read full article Comments",

The changes come after Disney and Paramount Skydance sent cease-and-desist letters to ByteDance urging the Chinese company to promptly end the allegedly vast and blatant infringement. Studios claimed the infringement was widescale and immediate, with Seedance 2.0 users across social media sharing AI videos featuring copyrighted characters like Spider-Man, Darth Vader, and SpongeBob Square Pants. In its letter, Disney fumed that Seedance was \"hijacking\" its characters, accusing ByteDance of treating Disney characters like they were \"free public domain clip art,\" Axios reported.Read full article Comments",

Apple has announced an event for March 4, which in usual Apple fashion, it has branded a \"Special Apple Experience.\" Also in usual Apple fashion, it has not come out and said what it's going to be announcing. We have a pretty good idea, though. The event will kick off at 9AM ET on March 4—Ars will be on the ground in New York City to cover Apple's latest unveiling, whatever form it may take. Apple doesn't release most products on a set schedule, but some recent speculation about likely hardware updates can point us in the right direction. As we reported recently, the iPhone 17e may be making an appearance in Apple's lineup soon. This updated version of the budget-oriented iPhone will have an A19 chip inside, similar to the one powering the base model iPhone 17. It may also add MagSafe charging. Don't expect to see a multi-camera array like you'd get on the more expensive Apple phones, though. Pricing will be the most important thing to watch for should Apple announce this phone. Right now, the non-Pro iPhone 16 and 17 (including the 16e) are all clustered in the $600-800 range. Another $599 budget iPhone won't make waves.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "In a recent study, University of Alaska Fairbanks paleontologist Matthew Wooller and his colleagues radiocarbon-dated what they thought were pieces of two mammoth vertebrae, only to get a whale of a surprise and a whole new mystery. At first glance, it looked like Wooller and his colleagues might have found evidence that mammoths lived in central Alaska just 2,000 years ago. But ancient DNA revealed that two “mammoth” bones actually belonged to a North Pacific right whale and a minke whale—which raised a whole new set of questions. The team’s hunt for Alaska’s last mammoth had turned into an epic case of mistaken identity, starring two whale species and a mid-century fossil hunter. “The first signs that something was amiss” The aptly named Wooller and his team have radiocarbon-dated more than 300 mammoth fossils over the last four years, looking for the last survivors of the wave of extinctions that wiped out woolly mammoths and other Pleistocene megafauna at the end of the last Ice Age. Two specimens stood out immediately. Based on the radiocarbon dates, two mammoths had lived near Fairbanks as recently as 2,800 and 1,900 years ago. Wooller and his colleagues had been looking for the youngest woolly mammoth specimen in Alaska but were completely mystified.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Up to a third of people worldwide have shoulder pain; it's one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints. But medical imaging might not reveal the problem—in fact, it could even cloud it. In a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine this week, 99 percent of adults over 40 were found to have at least one abnormality in a rotator cuff on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The rotator cuff is the group of muscles and tendons in a shoulder joint that keeps the upper arm bone securely in the shoulder socket—and is often blamed for pain and other symptoms. The trouble is, the vast majority of people in the study had no shoulder problems. The finding calls into question the growing use of MRIs to try to diagnose shoulder pain—and, in turn, the growing problem of overtreatment of rotator cuff (RC) abnormalities, which includes partial- and full-thickness tears as well as signs of tendinopathy (tendon swelling and thickening).Read full article Comments",

But Michigan’s approach is different: accusing Big Oil not of deceiving consumers or misrepresenting climate change risks, but of driving up energy costs by colluding to suppress competition from cleaner and cheaper technologies like solar power and electric vehicles. The strategy is risky and might run into challenges, but it could potentially be a game changer if the state can overcome initial dismissal attempts by the industry defendants, legal experts say. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed the lawsuit last month in federal District Court against BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and the American Petroleum Institute. The suit, brought under federal and state antitrust laws, alleges a conspiracy to delay the transition to renewable energy and EVs and maintain market dominance of fossil fuels.Read full article Comments",

Some MacBooks were discounted as much as 99 percent, a local CW affiliate reported. In total, Best Buy lost more than $118,000 from the scheme.

Solar energy is a possible alternative, but while we have become reasonably good at storing solar electricity in lithium-ion batteries, we’re not nearly as good at storing heat. To store heat for days, weeks, or months, you need to trap the energy in the bonds of a molecule that can later release heat on demand. The approach to this particular chemistry problem is called molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage. While it has been the next big thing for decades, it never really took off. In a recent Science paper, a team of researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and UCLA demonstrate a breakthrough that might finally make MOST energy storage effective.Read full article Comments",

SAARISELKÄ, FINLAND—If you're expecting it, the feeling in the pit of your stomach when the rear of your car breaks traction and begins to slide is rather pleasant. It's the same exhilaration we get from roller coasters, but when you're in the driver's seat, you're in charge of the ride. When you're not expecting it, though, there's anxiety instead of excitement and, should the slide end with a crunch, a lot more negative emotions, too. Thankfully, fewer and fewer drivers will have to experience that kind of scare thanks to the proliferation and sophistication of modern electronic stability and traction control systems. For more than 30 years, these electronic safety nets have grown in capability and became mandatory in the early 2010s, saving countless crashes in the process.Read full article Comments",
