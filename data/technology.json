Federal health agencies, in general, have taken heavy blows in Trump’s second term. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in particular, has seen the abrupt dismantling of whole programs and divisions—teams that provide critical health services to Americans. CDC staff regularly describe being demoralized over the last year. Their Senate-confirmed director didn’t make it a full month before being dramatically ousted after allegedly refusing to rubber-stamp vaccine recommendations from a panel filled with vaccine skeptics by anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert. F. Kennedy Jr. While the CDC is in shambles, the FDA has turned into something of a sideshow, with concern mounting that it remains a serious enough regulator to keep America’s medicines and treatments modern and safe. Many of the scandals are tied to Vinay Prasad, the Trump administration’s top vaccine regulator, who also has the titles of chief medical officer and chief scientific officer. Prasad made a name for himself on social media during the pandemic as a COVID-19 response skeptic and, since joining the FDA, has been known for overruling agency scientists and sowing distrust, unrest, and paranoia among staff. He was pushed out of the agency in July only to be reinstated about two weeks later.Read full article Comments",

The sky-high energy costs and logistical headaches of managing all those data centers have prompted interest in space-based infrastructure. Moguls like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk have mused about putting GPUs in space, and now Google confirms it’s working on its own version of the technology. The company’s latest “moonshot” is known as Project Suncatcher, and if all goes as planned, Google hopes it will lead to scalable networks of orbiting TPUs. The space around Earth has changed a lot in the last few years. A new generation of satellite constellations like Starlink has shown it’s feasible to relay Internet communication via orbital systems. Deploying high-performance AI accelerators in space along similar lines would be a boon to the industry’s never-ending build-out. Google notes that space may be “the best place to scale AI compute.” Google’s vision for scalable orbiting data centers relies on solar-powered satellites with free-space optical links connecting the nodes into a distributed network. Naturally, there are numerous engineering challenges to solve before Project Suncatcher is real. As a reference, Google points to the long road from its first moonshot self-driving cars 15 years ago to the Waymo vehicles that are almost fully autonomous today.Read full article Comments",

But motion smoothing often results in the dreaded soap opera effect and unwanted visual artifacts. Two upcoming HDR standards, HDR10+ Advanced and Dolby Vision 2, are looking to change how we perceive motion smoothing and more closely align motion interpolation with a creator’s vision. However, it’s unclear if these standards can pull that off. HDR10+ Advanced’s Intelligent FRC Today, Samsung provided details about the next version of the HDR10 format, which introduces six new features. Among HDR10+ Advanced’s most interesting features is HDR10+ Intelligent FRC (frame rate conversion), which is supposed to improve motion smoothing.Read full article Comments",

Grasshoppers, mantises, and moths all have them, and for decades, we thought that female stinkbugs of the Dinidoridae family have them, too, although located a bit unusually on their hind rather than front legs. Suspecting that they use their hind leg tympanal organs to listen to male courtship songs, a team of Japanese researchers took a closer look at the organs in Megymenum gracilicorne, a Dinidoridae stinkbug species native to Japan. They discovered that these “tympanal organs” were not what they seemed. They’re actually mobile fungal nurseries of a kind we’ve never seen before. Portable gardens Dinidoridae is a small stinkbug family that lives exclusively in Asia. The bug did attract some scientific attention, but not nearly as much as its larger relatives like Pentatomidae. Prior work looking specifically into organs growing on the hind legs of Dinidoridae females was thus somewhat limited. “Most research relied on taxonomic and morphological approaches. Some taxonomists did describe that female Dinidoridae stinkbugs have an enlarged part on the hind legs that looks like the tympanal organ you can find, for example, in crickets,” said Takema Fukatsu, an evolutionary biologist at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Tokyo.Read full article Comments",

LAS VEGAS—About 100 miles from Las Vegas, at the northern end of the Mojave Desert, you’ll find a pretty large pile of sand. The Dumont Dunes formed thousands of years ago as sand from recently dried-up lakes blew in on the wind through gaps in the mountains. We’re talking real Lawrence of Arabia stuff—some dunes hundreds of feet high, and a large amount of it is run as a recreational area by the Bureau of Land Management for activities that include a bit of off-roading. Which is why we found a trailer full of Mercedes-Benz engineers and some preproduction prototype electric GLCs at work out there. When we last saw the next GLC, it was earlier this year at a German test track, wearing one of those black-and-white digital camouflage wraps that obscure the finer details of a new design. The automaker is dealing with the finishing touches ahead of the model going into production next year. The hardware is signed off on, but there’s plenty of code to tweak and calibrations to perform, including making sure that even when the terrain gets loose, the handling won’t. While I’m sure that the vast majority of GLC customers’ experience with rough surfaces won’t extend past the odd, particularly bad pothole, the car is being engineered to cope with much more. When fitted with the optional air suspension, the ground clearance can increase to up to 8.1 inches (206 mm) at low speed and 7.2 inches (183 mm) even up to highway speed, as long as the car is in the more extreme of the two Terrain modes. That allows for approach and departure angles as much as 21.4 degrees (approach) and 22.6 degrees (departure).Read full article Comments",

This isn’t the first update that these operating systems have gotten since they were released in September, but it is the first to add significant changes and tweaks to existing features, addressing the early complaints and bugs that inevitably come with any major operating system update. One of the biggest changes across most of the platforms is a new translucency control for Liquid Glass that tones it down without totally disabling the effect.

Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who claims the Gemma model generated false accusations of sexual misconduct against her. Blackburn published her letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Friday, just hours before the company announced the change to Gemma availability. She demanded Google explain how the model could fail in this way, tying the situation to ongoing hearings that accuse Google and others of creating bots that defame conservatives. At the hearing, Google’s Markham Erickson explained that AI hallucinations are a widespread and known issue in generative AI, and Google does the best it can to mitigate the impact of such mistakes. Although no AI firm has managed to eliminate hallucinations, Google’s Gemini for Home has been particularly hallucination-happy in our testing.Read full article Comments",

It seemed like a relatively routine driver release with a typical list of bug fixes and game performance improvements, except for one accompanying announcement: AMD said at the time that it would be moving support for Radeon RX 5000-series and 6000-series GPUs (and their RDNA 1 and RDNA 2 architectures) to “maintenance mode.” That meant that a bunch of GPUs, including some dedicated graphics cards launched as recently as 2022, would no longer get fresh fixes and performance optimizations for newly launched games. As reported by Tom’s Hardware, AMD released several clarifying statements to address the ensuing backlash, saying that these older GPUs would still get “new features, bug fixes, and game optimizations” based on “market needs.” That must not have quieted the complaints, because AMD then made an entirely separate post to confirm that the 25.10.2 driver release “is not the end of support for RDNA 1 and RDNA 2,” and that integrated and dedicated GPUs based on these architectures would continue to receive “game support for new releases,” “stability and game optimizations,” and “security and bug fixes.” AMD confirmed that these older GPU architectures had been moved to a separate driver path, but the company says this is meant to keep fixes and features intended for newer RDNA 3 and RDNA 4-based GPUs from inadvertently breaking things for RDNA 1 and RDNA 2 GPUs.Read full article Comments",

To get around this problem, Anthropic is expanding on its previous research into AI interpretability with a new study that aims to measure LLMs’ actual so-called “introspective awareness” of their own inference processes. The full paper on “Emergent Introspective Awareness in Large Language Models” uses some interesting methods to separate out the metaphorical “thought process” represented by an LLM’s artificial neurons from simple text output that purports to represent that process. In the end, though, the research finds that current AI models are “highly unreliable” at describing their own inner workings and that “failures of introspection remain the norm.” Inception, but for AI Anthropic’s new research is centered on a process it calls “concept injection.” The method starts by comparing the model’s internal activation states following both a control prompt and an experimental prompt (e.g. an “ALL CAPS” prompt versus the same prompt in lower case). Calculating the differences between those activations across billions of internal neurons creates what Anthropic calls a “vector” that in some sense represents how that concept is modeled in the LLM’s internal state.Read full article Comments",

The document bears the title “Athena,” and it purports to summarize the actions that private astronaut Jared Isaacman would have taken, were his nomination to become NASA administrator confirmed. The 62-page plan is notable both for the ideas to remake NASA that it espouses as well as the manner in which it has been leaked to the space community.

Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), who proclaimed the organization a “perfect fit” to expand “access to federal government publications amid an increasingly digital landscape.” The Internet Archive might sound like a thriving organization, but it only recently emerged from years of bruising copyright battles that threatened to bankrupt the beloved library project. In the end, the fight led to more than 500,000 books being removed from the Archive’s “Open Library.” “We survived,” Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle told Ars. “But it wiped out the Library.”Read full article Comments",
