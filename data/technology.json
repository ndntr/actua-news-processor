The Federal Communications Commission last year fined T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon, saying the carriers illegally shared access to customers' location information without consent and did not take reasonable measures to protect that sensitive data against unauthorized disclosure. The fines relate to sharing of real-time location data that was revealed in 2018, but it took years for the FCC to finalize the penalties. The three carriers appealed the rulings in three different courts, and the first major decision was handed down Friday. A three-judge panel at the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled unanimously against T-Mobile and its subsidiary Sprint.Read full article Comments",

The report, which has not been adopted by the White House, is being viewed as friendly to industry, and it contains little to no policy recommendations or proposed regulations. For instance, it includes no proposed restrictions on pesticides or ultra-processed foods, which are top priorities of the MAHA movement. Otherwise, the document mainly rehashes the talking points and priorities of Kennedy's health crusades. That includes attacking water fluoridation, casting doubt on the safety of childhood vaccines, pushing for more physical activity in children to reduce chronic diseases, getting rid of synthetic food dyes, and claiming that children are being overprescribed medications.Read full article Comments",

There are a couple of reasons I chose The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall this time around: its co-creator, Julian LeFay, recently passed away, so it seemed timely. Also, it was one of the defining games of my youth—one I have continued to revisit now and then. But it's also interesting because of where its developer, Bethesda—a studio people both love and hate—is at today. Going back to Daggerfall, we find a game that shows off so much of what we've lost from the bygone era of '90s PC gaming, but also one that makes it abundantly clear why the industry left those sensibilities behind.Read full article Comments",

And while I could just claim to be too busy to spend hours on Newegg or Amazon or other sites digging through dozens of near-identical parts, the lack of updates usually correlates with \"times when building a desktop PC is actually a pain in the ass.\" Through most of 2025, fluctuating and inflated graphics card pricing and limited availability have once again conspired to make a normally fun hobby an annoying slog—and honestly kind of a bad way to spend your money, relative to just buying a Steam Deck or something and ignoring your desktop for a while. But three things have brought me back for another round. First, GPU pricing and availability have improved a little since early 2025. Second, as unreasonable as pricing is for PC parts, pre-built PCs with worse specs and other design compromises are unreasonably priced, too, and people should have some sense of what their options are. And third, I just have the itch—it's been a while since I built (or helped someone else build) a PC, and I need to get it out of my system.Read full article Comments",

But accidental ingestions still happen—like the Chihuahua who vets discovered had somehow managed to ingest a significant quantity of cocaine, according to a case study published in the journal Frontiers in Veterinary Science. There have been several studies investigating the bad effects cocaine can have on the cardiovascular systems of both humans and animals. However, these controlled studies are primarily done in laboratory settings and often don't match the messier clinical realities. \"Case reports are crucial in veterinary medicine by providing real-world examples,\" said co-author Jake Johnson of North Carolina State University. \"They capture clinical scenarios that larger studies might miss, preserve unusual presentations for future reference, and help build our collective understanding of rare presentations, ultimately improving emergency preparedness and treatment protocols.\" In the case of a 2-year-old male Chihuahua, the dog presented as lethargic and unresponsive. His owners had found him with his tongue sticking out and unable to focus visually. The Chihuahua was primarily an outdoor dog but was also allowed inside, and all its vaccines were up to date. Examination revealed bradycardia, i.e., a slow heart rate, a blue tinge to the dog's mucus membranes—often a sign of too much unoxygenated hemoglobin circulating through the system—and dilated pupils. The dog's symptoms faded after the vet administered a large dose of atropine, followed by epinephrine.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "When The Rocky Horror Picture Show premiered in 1975, no one could have dreamed that it would become the longest-running theatrical release film in history. But that's what happened. Thanks to a killer soundtrack, campy humor, and a devoted cult following, Rocky Horror is still a mainstay of midnight movie culture. In honor of its 50th anniversary, Disney/20th Century Studios is releasing a newly restored 4K HDR version in October, along with deluxe special editions on DVD and Blu-ray. And the film has inspired not one, but two documentaries marking its five decades of existence: Strange Journey: The Story of Rocky Horror and Sane Inside Insanity: The Phenomenon of Rocky Horror. (Spoilers below, because it's been 50 years.) The film is an adaptation of Richard O'Brien's 1973 musical for the stage, The Rocky Horror Show. At the time, he was a struggling actor and wrote the musical as an homage to the science fiction and B horror movies he'd loved since a child. In fact, the opening song (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature\") makes explicit reference to many of those, including 1951's The Day the Earth Stood Still, Flash Gordon (1936), King Kong (1933), The Invisible Man (1933), Forbidden Planet (1956), and The Day of the Triffids (1962), among others.Read full article Comments",
