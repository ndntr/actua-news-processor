Even with Jimmy Kimmel Live! returning to its normal schedule, it’s still not clear whether all ABC affiliates will air it. The Verge reached out to Sinclair Broadcast Group and Nexstar for more information but didn’t immediately hear back. During the episode that got Jimmy Kimmel Live! pulled off the airwaves, Kimmel remarked that “we hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.” Federal Communications Chair Brendan Carr claimed the statement violated broadcasters’ mandate to act in the “public interest” and said they could handle Kimmel “the easy way or the hard way” — the latter with the FCC involved. The decision to suspend Kimmel’s talk show sparked outrage among Democratic lawmakers, free speech advocates, and hundreds of celebrities who signed a letter in support of Kimmel, calling the situation a “dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.” The FCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it would retaliate against Disney, ABC, or broadcasters that put Kimmel’s show back on the air. “I am glad to see Disney find its courage in the face of clear government intimidation,” Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez said in response to the decision. “It will continue to be up to us as citizens to push back against this Administration’s growing campaign of censorship and control.” Update, September 22nd: Added a statement from Gomez.",

Kennedy Jr. made an announcement—in line with earlier reporting—that there is a \"potential association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes,\" specifically autism. The Food and Drug Administration will work to update the drug's safety label and notify physicians of the concerns. At the same time, the administration also touted leucovorin (folinic acid) as a potential treatment for autism. Below is the original story, published at 2:47 pm ET today. Health Secretary and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is reportedly poised to announce that use of Tylenol (aka acetaminophen, paracetamol) during pregnancy is linked to autism—an unproven assertion that has sent Kennedy's anti-vaccine allies into a rage. \"We didn’t wait 20 years for Bobby to finally speak and then get served Tylenol as an answer,\" anti-vaccine group Georgia Coalition for Vaccine Choice wrote in an unhinged Facebook post on Monday morning. \"If that's all we hear - is that the end? Not thimerosal. Not aluminum. Not MMR. Not Hep B. Not the insane schedule pushed after pharma got liability protection. Are we supposed to just forget?\" Children's Health Defense (CHD)—the anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy—even got in on the backlash, retweeting a post on Monday about parents who falsely blame vaccines for their children's neurological condition, with the statement: \"THIS WAS NOT CAUSED BY TYLENOL.\"Read full article Comments",

US District Judge Leonie Brinkema has already ruled that Google operated an illegal monopoly in digital advertising, and now it's time to learn the consequences of that behavior. Google's had mixed luck with antitrust rulings lately, but it's not a great sign that Google has so many legal woes that it can be hard to keep them all straight. The case that just got underway is the remedy phase of the AdTech trial, in which the DOJ secured a ruling against Google several months ago. The remedy phase of the search trial wrapped up recently, which ended with Google holding on to Chrome but pledging an appeal to overturn the verdict. There's also the Google Play antitrust case, which was brought by Epic Games. In this case, Google has already lost its appeal, putting some major app changes on the table as it plans yet another appeal. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and Google are squaring off in Virginia federal court for the next two weeks or so, and there are no surprises in opening arguments. The government says the only way to deal with a monopolist like this is to break it up, but Google says it has already made numerous changes, and there's no way to excise it from online advertising without breaking the market.Read full article Comments",

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC that the planned 10 gigawatts equals the power consumption of between 4 million and 5 million graphics processing units, which matches the company's total GPU shipments for this year and doubles last year's volume. \"This is a giant project,\" Huang said in an interview alongside Altman and OpenAI President Greg Brockman.Read full article Comments",

Researchers at Google DeepMind spend a lot of time thinking about how generative AI systems can become threats, detailing it all in the company's Frontier Safety Framework. DeepMind recently released version 3.0 of the framework to explore more ways AI could go off the rails, including the possibility that models could ignore user attempts to shut them down. DeepMind's safety framework is based on so-called \"critical capability levels\" (CCLs). These are essentially risk assessment rubrics that aim to measure an AI model's capabilities and define the point at which its behavior becomes dangerous in areas like cybersecurity or biosciences. The document also details the ways developers can address the CCLs DeepMind identifies in their own models. Google and other firms that have delved deeply into generative AI employ a number of techniques to prevent AI from acting maliciously. Although calling an AI \"malicious\" lends it intentionality that fancy estimation architectures don't have. What we're talking about here is the possibility of misuse or malfunction that is baked into the nature of generative AI systems.Read full article Comments",

According to Tesla's crash reports, spotted by Brad Templeton over at Forbes, the automaker experienced not one but three crashes, all apparently on its first day of testing on July 1.

By contrast, Waymo's crash rate is more than two orders of magnitude lower, with 60 crashes logged over 50 million miles of driving.

Friday's practice sessions gave the Ferrari-supporting Tifosi something to look forward to, with Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc topping the times for FP2.

          "content": "Disney CEO Bob Iger has been under fire for several days now for pulling Jimmy Kimmel Live off the air \"indefinitely,\" with Disney+'s cancellation page actually crashing a couple of times from all the traffic as people rushed to make their displeasure known. So what better time for the studio to release the first teaser trailer for The Mandalorian and Grogu, a feature film spinoff from its megahit Star Wars series The Mandalorian? Grogu and Mando, together again on an exciting space adventure, will certainly be a crowd-pleaser. Grogu (aka Baby Yoda) won viewers' hearts from the moment he first appeared onscreen in the first season of The Mandalorian, and the relationship between the little green creature and his father-figure bounty hunter has only gotten stronger. With the 2023 Hollywood strikes delaying production on S4 of the series, director Jon Favreau got the green light to make this spinoff film. Per the official logline:Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Larry Page and Sergey Brin met each other at a graduate student orientation at Stanford in 1996. Both were studying for their PhDs in computer science, and both were interested in analyzing large sets of data. Because the web was growing so rapidly, they decided to start a project to improve the way people found information on the Internet. They weren’t the first to try this. Hand-curated sites like Yahoo had already given way to more algorithmic search engines like AltaVista and Excite, which both started in 1995. These sites attempted to find relevant webpages by analyzing the words on every page. Page and Brin’s technique was different. Their “BackRub” software created a map of all the links that pages had to each other. Pages on a given subject that had many incoming links from other sites were given a higher ranking for that keyword. Higher-ranked pages could then contribute a larger score to any pages they linked to. In a sense, this was a like a crowdsourcing of search: When people put “This is a good place to read about alligators” on a popular site and added a link to a page about alligators, it did a better job of determining that page’s relevance than simply counting the number of times the word appeared on a page.Read full article Comments",
