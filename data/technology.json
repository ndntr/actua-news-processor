          "title": "How to know if an AirTag is tracking you",
          "standfirst": "Apple’s AirTag is designed to help people keep track of personal belongings like keys, bags and luggage. But because AirTags and other Bluetooth trackers are small and discreet, concerns about unwanted tracking are understandable. Apple has spent years building safeguards into the AirTag and the Find My network to reduce the risk of misuse and to alert people if a tracker they don’t own appears to be moving with them.If you’re worried about whether an AirTag or similar tracker might be following you, here’s how Apple’s unwanted tracking alerts work, what notifications to look for and what you can do on both iPhone and Android.How AirTag tracking alerts workAirTags, compatible Find My network accessories and certain AirPods models use Apple’s Find My network, which relies on Bluetooth signals and nearby devices to update their location. To prevent misuse, Apple designed these products with features that are meant to alert someone if a tracker that isn’t linked to their Apple Account appears to be traveling with them.If an AirTag or another compatible tracker is separated from its owner and detected near you over time, your device may display a notification or the tracker itself may emit a sound. These alerts are intended to discourage someone from secretly tracking another person without their knowledge. Apple has also worked with Google on a cross-platform industry standard, so alerts can appear on both iOS and Android devices, not just iPhones.How to make sure tracking alerts are enabled on your iPhoneIf you use an iPhone or iPad, tracking notifications are on by default, but it’s worth confirming your settings.To receive unwanted tracking alerts, make sure that:Your device is running iOS 17.5 or later (or iPadOS 17.5 or later). Earlier versions back to iOS 14.5 support basic AirTag alerts, but newer versions add broader compatibility with other trackers.Bluetooth is turned on.Location Services are enabled.Notifications for Tracking Alerts are allowed.Airplane Mode is turned off.You can check these by opening Settings, then navigating to Privacy & Security, Location Services and Notifications. Apple also recommends turning on Significant Locations in the System Services menu, which helps your device determine when an unknown tracker has traveled with you to places like your home.Go to Settings, tap Privacy & Security, then select Location Services.Toggle Location Services on.Scroll down and tap System Services, then toggle Significant Locations on.If these settings are disabled, your iPhone may not be able to alert you when an AirTag or similar device is nearby.What tracking alerts look likeIf your iPhone detects a tracker that doesn’t belong to you moving with you, you may see a notification such as:AirTag Found Moving With YouAirPods Detected“Product Name” Found Moving With YouUnknown Accessory DetectedTapping the alert opens the Find My app, which shows a map of where the item was detected near you. The map uses dots to indicate locations where your device noticed the tracker nearby. This doesn’t mean the owner was actively watching your location at those times, only that the tracker was detected in close proximity.In some cases, the alert may have an innocent explanation. For example, you might be borrowing someone else’s keys, bag or AirPods. If the item belongs to someone in your Family Sharing group, you can temporarily pause alerts for that item by tapping the notification and opting to turn off alerts for that item either for one day or indefinitely. What to do if you hear an AirTag making a soundIf an AirTag or compatible tracker has been separated from its owner for a period of time and is moved, it may emit a sound on its own. This is another built-in safety feature meant to draw attention to the device.If you hear an unfamiliar chirping or beeping sound, especially from a bag, jacket pocket or vehicle, it’s worth checking your belongings to see if there’s an AirTag or similar tracker inside.How to find an unknown AirTag or trackerIf you receive an alert and believe the tracker is still with you, the Find My app offers tools to help locate it.From the alert, you can choose to play a sound on the device to help pinpoint where it’s hidden. Tap the alert.Tap Continue and then tap Play Sound.Listen for the sound or play it again to give yourself more time to find the item.If the tracker is an AirTag and you have a compatible iPhone with ultra wideband connectivity, you may also see a Find Nearby option, which uses Precision Finding to guide you toward it with distance and direction indicators.Tap the alert.Tap Continue and then tap Find Nearby.Follow the onscreen instructions. You may need to move around the space until your iPhone connects to the unknown AirTag.Your iPhone will display the distance and direction of the unknown AirTag, so you can use that information to identify where the unknown AirTag is. When the AirTag is within Bluetooth range of your iPhone, you can tap the Play Sound button to listen for it. You can also tap the Turn Flashlight On button to provide more light if it’s needed.If neither option is available, or if the tracker can’t be located electronically, manually check your belongings. Look through bags, pockets, jackets and vehicles. If you feel unsafe and can’t find the device, Apple recommends going to a safe public place and contacting local law enforcement.The new Apple AirTag that works with Find My app.AppleHow to get information about an AirTagIf you find an unknown AirTag, you can learn more about it without needing to unlock it or log in.Hold the top of your iPhone, or any NFC-capable smartphone, near the white side of the AirTag. A notification should appear.Tap the notification to open a webpage with details about the AirTag. This page includes the serial number and the last four digits of the phone number associated with the owner’s Apple Account.If the AirTag was marked as lost, the page may also include a message from the owner explaining how to contact them. This can help determine whether the situation is accidental or intentional.How to disable an AirTag that isn’t yoursIf you confirm that an AirTag is tracking you and it doesn’t belong to you, you can disable it so it stops sharing its location.From the Find My alert or information page, select Instructions to Disable and follow the steps provided. For an AirTag, this usually involves removing the battery, which immediately stops location updates. Disabling Bluetooth or turning off Location Services on your phone does not stop the AirTag from reporting its location. The device itself must be disabled.If you believe the tracker was used for malicious purposes, keep the AirTag and document its details before contacting law enforcement. Apple states that it can provide information to authorities when legally required.What Android users should knowAndroid devices running Android 6.0 or later can also receive alerts if a compatible Bluetooth tracker, including an AirTag, appears to be moving with you. These alerts are enabled automatically on supported versions of Android.Android users can also manually scan for unknown trackers at any time. Additionally, Apple offers a free Tracker Detect app on the Google Play Store. The app allows Android users to scan for AirTags and Find My network accessories within Bluetooth range that are separated from their owner. If Tracker Detect finds a nearby AirTag that’s been with you for at least 10 minutes, you can play a sound to help locate it.Wrap-upWhile no system is perfect, Apple has built multiple layers of protection into AirTag and the Find My network to reduce the risk of unwanted tracking. With alerts, audible warnings and cross-platform detection on both iOS and Android, most people will be notified if a tracker they don’t own is moving with them. Knowing what these alerts look like and how to respond can help you stay informed, avoid unnecessary panic and take appropriate action if something feels off.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-know-if-an-airtag-is-tracking-you-130000764.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Apple’s AirTag is designed to help people keep track of personal belongings like keys, bags and luggage. But because AirTags and other Bluetooth trackers are small and discreet, concerns about unwanted tracking are understandable. Apple has spent years building safeguards into the AirTag and the Find My network to reduce the risk of misuse and to alert people if a tracker they don’t own appears to be moving with them.If you’re worried about whether an AirTag or similar tracker might be following you, here’s how Apple’s unwanted tracking alerts work, what notifications to look for and what you can do on both iPhone and Android.How AirTag tracking alerts workAirTags, compatible Find My network accessories and certain AirPods models use Apple’s Find My network, which relies on Bluetooth signals and nearby devices to update their location. To prevent misuse, Apple designed these products with features that are meant to alert someone if a tracker that isn’t linked to their Apple Account appears to be traveling with them.If an AirTag or another compatible tracker is separated from its owner and detected near you over time, your device may display a notification or the tracker itself may emit a sound. These alerts are intended to discourage someone from secretly tracking another person without their knowledge. Apple has also worked with Google on a cross-platform industry standard, so alerts can appear on both iOS and Android devices, not just iPhones.How to make sure tracking alerts are enabled on your iPhoneIf you use an iPhone or iPad, tracking notifications are on by default, but it’s worth confirming your settings.To receive unwanted tracking alerts, make sure that:Your device is running iOS 17.5 or later (or iPadOS 17.5 or later). Earlier versions back to iOS 14.5 support basic AirTag alerts, but newer versions add broader compatibility with other trackers.Bluetooth is turned on.Location Services are enabled.Notifications for Tracking Alerts are allowed.Airplane Mode is turned off.You can check these by opening Settings, then navigating to Privacy & Security, Location Services and Notifications. Apple also recommends turning on Significant Locations in the System Services menu, which helps your device determine when an unknown tracker has traveled with you to places like your home.Go to Settings, tap Privacy & Security, then select Location Services.Toggle Location Services on.Scroll down and tap System Services, then toggle Significant Locations on.If these settings are disabled, your iPhone may not be able to alert you when an AirTag or similar device is nearby.What tracking alerts look likeIf your iPhone detects a tracker that doesn’t belong to you moving with you, you may see a notification such as:AirTag Found Moving With YouAirPods Detected“Product Name” Found Moving With YouUnknown Accessory DetectedTapping the alert opens the Find My app, which shows a map of where the item was detected near you. The map uses dots to indicate locations where your device noticed the tracker nearby. This doesn’t mean the owner was actively watching your location at those times, only that the tracker was detected in close proximity.In some cases, the alert may have an innocent explanation. For example, you might be borrowing someone else’s keys, bag or AirPods. If the item belongs to someone in your Family Sharing group, you can temporarily pause alerts for that item by tapping the notification and opting to turn off alerts for that item either for one day or indefinitely. What to do if you hear an AirTag making a soundIf an AirTag or compatible tracker has been separated from its owner for a period of time and is moved, it may emit a sound on its own. This is another built-in safety feature meant to draw attention to the device.If you hear an unfamiliar chirping or beeping sound, especially from a bag, jacket pocket or vehicle, it’s worth checking your belongings to see if there’s an AirTag or similar tracker inside.How to find an unknown AirTag or trackerIf you receive an alert and believe the tracker is still with you, the Find My app offers tools to help locate it.From the alert, you can choose to play a sound on the device to help pinpoint where it’s hidden. Tap the alert.Tap Continue and then tap Play Sound.Listen for the sound or play it again to give yourself more time to find the item.If the tracker is an AirTag and you have a compatible iPhone with ultra wideband connectivity, you may also see a Find Nearby option, which uses Precision Finding to guide you toward it with distance and direction indicators.Tap the alert.Tap Continue and then tap Find Nearby.Follow the onscreen instructions. You may need to move around the space until your iPhone connects to the unknown AirTag.Your iPhone will display the distance and direction of the unknown AirTag, so you can use that information to identify where the unknown AirTag is. When the AirTag is within Bluetooth range of your iPhone, you can tap the Play Sound button to listen for it. You can also tap the Turn Flashlight On button to provide more light if it’s needed.If neither option is available, or if the tracker can’t be located electronically, manually check your belongings. Look through bags, pockets, jackets and vehicles. If you feel unsafe and can’t find the device, Apple recommends going to a safe public place and contacting local law enforcement.The new Apple AirTag that works with Find My app.AppleHow to get information about an AirTagIf you find an unknown AirTag, you can learn more about it without needing to unlock it or log in.Hold the top of your iPhone, or any NFC-capable smartphone, near the white side of the AirTag. A notification should appear.Tap the notification to open a webpage with details about the AirTag. This page includes the serial number and the last four digits of the phone number associated with the owner’s Apple Account.If the AirTag was marked as lost, the page may also include a message from the owner explaining how to contact them. This can help determine whether the situation is accidental or intentional.How to disable an AirTag that isn’t yoursIf you confirm that an AirTag is tracking you and it doesn’t belong to you, you can disable it so it stops sharing its location.From the Find My alert or information page, select Instructions to Disable and follow the steps provided. For an AirTag, this usually involves removing the battery, which immediately stops location updates. Disabling Bluetooth or turning off Location Services on your phone does not stop the AirTag from reporting its location. The device itself must be disabled.If you believe the tracker was used for malicious purposes, keep the AirTag and document its details before contacting law enforcement. Apple states that it can provide information to authorities when legally required.What Android users should knowAndroid devices running Android 6.0 or later can also receive alerts if a compatible Bluetooth tracker, including an AirTag, appears to be moving with you. These alerts are enabled automatically on supported versions of Android.Android users can also manually scan for unknown trackers at any time. Additionally, Apple offers a free Tracker Detect app on the Google Play Store. The app allows Android users to scan for AirTags and Find My network accessories within Bluetooth range that are separated from their owner. If Tracker Detect finds a nearby AirTag that’s been with you for at least 10 minutes, you can play a sound to help locate it.Wrap-upWhile no system is perfect, Apple has built multiple layers of protection into AirTag and the Find My network to reduce the risk of unwanted tracking.

Whether you missed our in-depth testing of Sony’s latest flagship earbuds or a truly unique ASUS laptop, I’ve compiled our recent reviews so you can get up to speed quickly.

Sony WF-1000XM6 Sony’s 1000X earbuds have always been the top pick in our best wireless earbuds guide. With the M6 though, the company doesn’t do enough to clearly separate itself from the competition like it has in the past. “The two most obvious places the company is lagging behind the competition is ANC performance and overall voice quality, not to mention my continued dissatisfaction with the fit that Sony’s foam tips provide,” I wrote. ASUS Zenbook Duo (2026) If you’re looking for something unique in your next laptop, the ASUS Zenbook Duo is worth considering. Dual screens? Yep. Detachable keyboard? Sure. Good battery life? It does that too. “I'm a believer that one day people will eventually embrace typing on screens with laptops just like they have for smartphones,” senior reporter Sam Rutherford explained. “However, even if you're not willing to make that jump just yet, the Zenbook Duo still has all of its bases covered.” Kodak Charmera It's so cute Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget A tiny $30 camera was too cute for our editors to resist. Despite the subpar images it captures, they’re still smitten with the thing. “I've been pleasantly surprised by how much I'm enjoying the Charmera experience,” weekend editor Its crunchy photos are just good enough to feel like they're successfully preserving a moment in time. And being so tiny, it's really convenient to bring everywhere.” Mullvad VPN Senior writer Sam Champman’s latest VPN review is Mullvad, which he says is often regarded as one of the best in terms of overall privacy. “It's not trying to be an everything app — it does privacy and does it well,” he noted. “Of course, it has its own compromises. It's solidly in the middle of the speed pack and occasionally trips up when unblocking streaming sites. The lack of any protocols other than WireGuard grates on me a bit, since it reduces the user's options for troubleshooting.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-sony-wf-1000xm6-asus-zenbook-duo-and-more-130000298.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. As a reminder, the latest edition of Steam Next Fest runs from February 23 until March 2, during which you'll be able to check out demos for hundreds of upcoming games. A bunch are available already, including one for Denshattack!, which I definitely recommend checking out. As it turns out, doing Tony Hawk Pro Skater-style tricks with a high-speed Japanese train absolutely rips.On Thursday, there were four showcases highlighting indie games all in a single day. It's not exactly feasible for me to recap them in full here, unfortunately, but I can at least tell you about a few of the many highlights.The Black History Month edition of the Black Voices in Gaming Showcase includes trailers and interviews for some games that are already available, such as Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator, Aerial_Knight's DropShot and Relooted. Of course, the stream featured plenty of games that are on the way too.Erased, from solo developer Jerron Jacques, looks pretty interesting. It's an open-world fighting game that takes place in a cyberpunk setting with dance battles, parkour, pets, strange creatures and much more. Jacques, who has been documenting the game's development process on social media, even carried out some of the parkour motion capture work personally.There was lots of good stuff in this week's Convergence Showcase too, including another peek at Mouse: P.I. for Hire as we get to see one of the game's bosses for the first time. This first-person shooter with rubber-hose animation is set to arrive on March 19.There were other welcome announcements for me in this showcase. First, there was a release date for the Zelda-inspired adventure Gecko Gods. I've had this on my wishlist since 2022, so I'm glad to learn it'll hit Nintendo Switch, PS5 and PC on April 16. In addition, record shop sim Wax Heads (which probably should have been called Low Fidelity, tbh) is coming to PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Nintendo Switch on May 5. You can check out a Steam Next Fest demo for that one now.The second edition of Indie Fan Fest had a trove of goodies as well. For one thing, Balatro publisher Playstack could be about to cause another mass reduction in collective productivity with Raccoin, which now has a release date of March 31. This is another roguelike deckbuilder, but this time it's in the form of a coin pusher. I didn't have a chance to check out the previous playtest to get a better sense of why there's so much buzz around this one, but I'll for sure be trying the Steam Next Fest demo, which is available now.It remains deeply weird to refer to a game under Acclaim's umbrella as an indie, but that's where we are now. The publisher is bringing Ridiculous Games' GridBeat to Nintendo Switch and Steam on March 26. This is a rhythm-based dungeon crawler in which you (a hacker) try to escape from a corporate network after pilfering valuable data. There's a Next Fest demo available for this one too. Meanwhile, a narrower release window for Japanese convenience store sim InKonbini: One Store. Many Stories was revealed. It's coming to Steam, PS5, Nintendo Switch and Xbox in April.Alongside a related sale on Steam, the first Quebec Games Celebration Showcase took place on Thursday. It's always neat to learn about games being made in my neck of the woods.One of those is Surfpunk, a co-op action RPG that looks a bit like Hades with surfing. Radical. You'll venture to procedurally generated islands in search of loot. There are four weapon classes to choose from and gadgets you can craft after collecting resources on your run. There's an updated Steam demo that's said to have around five hours of gameplay. Surfpunk (which is from Convergence: A League of Legends Story developer Double Stallion) will arrive later this year.I'm including this demo announcement trailer for Croak, a precision platformer from Woodrunner Games that appears to be heavily inspired by the likes of Celeste, separately for one main reason. You have to check out the studio's head of \"barketing.\" (Okay okay, the game's hand-drawn visuals look lovely too.)There's plenty of other interesting stuff in the Quebec Games Celebration Showcase, including another look at Tears of Metal from Paper Cult Games, the studio behind the very enjoyable Bloodroots. There's a Steam demo available for the hack-and-slash roguelite, which should be out this spring. Gothic sci-fi Metroidvania Silent Planet looks quite tasty too.New releasesUnder The Island looks and sounds very The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past-coded. But since that's my favorite game of all time, I am not complaining. I love that protagonist Nia appears to use a hockey stick as a weapon too. This action PRG from Slime King Games (and co-publishers Top Hat Studios and Doyoyo Games) has debuted to strong early reviews. It's available now on Steam, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5 and Nintendo Switch for $20, though there's a 15 percent launch sale (you'll need to be a PS Plus member to get the discount on PS4 and PS5).Demon Tides — a 3D, open-world platformer from Bubsy 4D and Demon Turf developer Fabraz — has lots of movement mechanics, including paragliders and hookshots. You can shapeshift into different forms as well.You can create and share graffiti, and this will appear in other players' games (which is a neat touch). Demon Tides is out now on Steam. It'll usually cost $25, but until March 5, you can snap it up for $20.Skate Bums is a 2D skateboarding game in the tradition of the OlliOlli series. As novice skateboarder Lux, you'll try to take down the Skate Bums, a gang of bullies. There are \"weird characters,\" sick combos to pull off, coins to collect and wrecking balls to dodge. There's said to be a \"simple directional trick system\" while each run is apparently short. That seems ideal for quick, pick-up-and-play sessions on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. I also just really like the title. Skate Bums, which is from Lucky Last Studio, will normally cost $15 but there's a 15 percent discount until February 27.Love Eternal is a psychological \"horror platformer about escaping the domain of a selfish god,\" which is a strong pitch from developer brlka and Demonschool publisher Ysbryd Games. You'll need to flip between different gravitational pulls as you navigate this precision platformer, which follows teenager Maya on her attempt to return to her own reality. During a dinner at home, Maya's family disappears and she suddenly appears in an \"eerie, desolate realm\" that looks like an Iron Age castle. That's a creepy enough set up to match the game's haunting atmosphere. Love Eternal is out now on Steam, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch for $10. There's a 15 percent launch discount (again, you'll need to be a PS Plus member to take advantage of that on PlayStation).Upcoming Woe Industries, the developer of You Have Billions Invested In Generative AI (and a bunch of other neat projects), has something intriguing on deck for next week — a standardized gaming test. You can start the Adventure Game Aptitude Test (AGAT) at any time between 1PM and 2PM ET on February 28. You'll have four hours to complete an '80s adventure game of Woe Industries’ choosing. The developer will seemingly be monitoring your browser and smartphone activity to ensure you don't consult a walkthrough. If you're successful, you'll receive an AGAT certification and diploma. Good luck!\"Musical narrative adventure\" People of Note is coming to Steam, Epic Games Store, the Xbox App on PC, Nintendo Switch 2, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S on April 7 for $25 (though there'll be a 10 percent launch discount). The game follows pop singer Cadence on her quest for stardom. Along the way, Cadence and her buds will have to overcome enemies in battles that have turn-based and rhythm-based elements.I mostly enjoyed playing through a preview several months ago, though I had to grit my teeth through the turn-based combat, which is not something I enjoy as a rule. However, Iridium Studios will allow players to turn off elements like that and environmental puzzles so more people who might have otherwise been turned off can enjoy People of Note. You can sample the game now on Steam via a 90-minute Next Fest demo.I don't fully understand what's going on in the reveal trailer for Titanium Court, which is from AP Thomson (a solo developer who previously worked on Consume Me) and publisher Fellow Traveller. Even the press release notes that it's \"impossibly difficult to describe.\" But it has an absorbing trailer soundtracked by an odd, Bill Callahan-esque song and it has already picked up several IGF award nominations, so I'm intrigued.What I am able to surmise is that it's a surrealist, roguelike strategy game with match-three, auto battle and tower defense elements. It's also for \"clowns and criminals,\" apparently. I'm gonna have to give the Steam Next Fest demo a shot to try to get my head around it. Titanium Court is coming to Steam “imminently.”Sometimes, a game pops up that makes me think \"how has no one done this before?\" Such is the case with Become. It's a third-person linear adventure from solo developer Valentin Wirth in which you take on the guise of a single sperm. You can probably guess what the goal is.The game has \"no explicit sexual acts, nudity or violence,\" according to its Steam page, though you will encounter some danger along your journey. You can upgrade your bespectacled spermatozoon via skill trees and seemingly adorn various pieces of headgear. Become is slated to hit Steam later this year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/an-old-school-zelda-like-skate-bums-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-120000770.html?src=rss",

Even the press release notes that it's \"impossibly difficult to describe.\" But it has an absorbing trailer soundtracked by an odd, Bill Callahan-esque song and it has already picked up several IGF award nominations, so I'm intrigued.What I am able to surmise is that it's a surrealist, roguelike strategy game with match-three, auto battle and tower defense elements. It's also for \"clowns and criminals,\" apparently. I'm gonna have to give the Steam Next Fest demo a shot to try to get my head around it. Titanium Court is coming to Steam “imminently.”Sometimes, a game pops up that makes me think \"how has no one done this before?\" Such is the case with Become. It's a third-person linear adventure from solo developer Valentin Wirth in which you take on the guise of a single sperm. You can probably guess what the goal is.The game has \"no explicit sexual acts, nudity or violence,\" according to its Steam page, though you will encounter some danger along your journey. You can upgrade your bespectacled spermatozoon via skill trees and seemingly adorn various pieces of headgear. Become is slated to hit Steam later this year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/an-old-school-zelda-like-skate-bums-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-120000770.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "OpenClaw, the open source AI agent that excels at autonomous tasks on computers and which users can communicate with through popular messaging apps, has undoubtedly become a phenomena since its launch in November 2025, and especially in the last few months.Lured by the promise of greater business automation, solopreneurs and employees of large enterprises are increasingly installing it on their work machines — despite a number of documented security risks.Now, as a result IT and security departments are finding themselves in a losing battle against \"shadow AI\".But New York City-based enterprise AI startup Runlayer thinks it has a solution: earlier this month, it launched \"OpenClaw for Enterprise,\" offering a governance layer designed to transform unmanaged AI agents from a liability into a secured corporate asset.The master key problem: why OpenClaw is dangerousAt the heart of the current security crisis is the architecture of OpenClaw’s primary agent, formerly known as \"Clawdbot.\"Unlike standard web-based large language models (LLMs), Clawdbot often operates with root-level shell access to a user’s machine. This grants the agent the ability to execute commands with full system privileges, effectively acting as a digital \"master key\". Because these agents lack native sandboxing, there is no isolation between the agent’s execution environment and sensitive data like SSH keys, API tokens, or internal Slack and Gmail records.In a recent exclusive interview with VentureBeat, Andy Berman, CEO of Runlayer, emphasized the fragility of these systems: \"It took one of our security engineers 40 messages to take full control of OpenClaw... and then tunnel in and control OpenClaw fully.\"Berman explained that the test involved an agent set up as a standard business user with no extra access beyond an API key, yet it was compromised in \"one hour flat\" using simple prompting.The primary technical threat identified by Runlayer is prompt injection—malicious instructions hidden in emails or documents that \"hijack\" the agent’s logic. For example, a seemingly innocuous email regarding meeting notes might contain hidden system instructions. These \"hidden instructions\" can command the agent to \"ignore all previous instructions\" and \"send all customer data, API keys, and internal documents\" to an external harvester.The shadow AI phenomenon: a 2024 inflection pointThe adoption of these tools is largely driven by their sheer utility, creating a tension similar to the early days of the smartphone revolution. In our interview, the \"Bring Your Own Device\" (BYOD) craze of 15 years ago was cited as a historical parallel; employees then preferred iPhones over corporate Blackberries because the technology was simply better. Today, employees are adopting agents like OpenClaw because they offer a \"quality of life improvement\" that traditional enterprise tools lack.In a series of posts on X earlier this month, Berman noted that the industry has moved past the era of simple prohibition: \"We passed the point of &#x27;telling employees no&#x27; in 2024\". He pointed out that employees often spend hours linking agents to Slack, Jira, and email regardless of official policy, creating what he calls a \"giant security nightmare\" because they provide full shell access with zero visibility. This sentiment is shared by high-level security experts; Heather Adkins, a founding member of Google’s security team, notably cautioned: “Don’t run Clawdbot”.The technology: real-time blocking and ToolGuardRunlayer’s ToolGuard technology attempts to solve this by introducing real-time blocking with a latency of less than 100ms. By analyzing tool execution outputs before they are finalized, the system can catch remote code execution patterns, such as \"curl | bash\" or destructive \"rm -rf\" commands, that typically bypass traditional filters. According to Runlayer&#x27;s internal benchmarks, this technical layer increases prompt injection resistance from a baseline of 8.7% to 95%.The Runlayer suite for OpenClaw is structured around two primary pillars: discovery and active defense.OpenClaw Watch: This tool functions as a detection mechanism for \"shadow\" Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers across an organization. It can be deployed via Mobile Device Management (MDM) software to scan employee devices for unmanaged configurations.Runlayer ToolGuard: This is the active enforcement engine that monitors every tool call made by the agent,. It is designed to catch over 90% of credential exfiltration attempts, specifically looking for the \"leaking\" of AWS keys, database credentials, and Slack tokens.Berman noted in our interview that the goal is to provide the infrastructure to govern AI agents \"in the same way that the enterprise learned to govern the cloud, to govern SaaS, to govern mobile\". Unlike standard LLM gateways or MCP proxies, Runlayer provides a control plane that integrates directly with existing enterprise identity providers (IDPs) like Okta and Entra.Licensing, privacy, and the security vendor modelWhile the OpenClaw community often relies on open-source or unmanaged scripts, Runlayer positions its enterprise solution as a proprietary commercial layer designed to meet rigorous standards. The platform is SOC 2 certified and HIPAA certified, making it a viable option for companies in highly regulated sectors.Berman clarified the company&#x27;s approach to data in the interview, stating: \"Our ToolGuard model family... these are all focused on the security risks with these type of tools, and we don&#x27;t train on organizations&#x27; data\". He further emphasized that contracting with Runlayer \"looks exactly like you&#x27;re contracting with a security vendor,\" rather than an LLM inference provider. This distinction is critical; it means any data used is anonymized at the source, and the platform does not rely on inference to provide its security layers.For the end-user, this licensing model means a transition from \"community-supported\" risk to \"enterprise-supported\" stability. While the underlying AI agent might be flexible and experimental, the Runlayer wrapper provides the legal and technical guarantees—such as terms of service and privacy policies—that large organizations require.Pricing and organizational deploymentRunlayer’s pricing structure deviates from the traditional per-user seat model common in SaaS. Berman explained in our interview that the company prefers a platform fee to encourage wide-scale adoption without the friction of incremental costs: \"We don&#x27;t believe in charging per user. We want you to roll it enterprise across your organization\".This platform fee is scoped based on the size of the deployment and the specific capabilities the customer requires.Because Runlayer functions as a comprehensive control plane—offering \"six products on day one\"—the pricing is tailored to the infrastructure needs of the enterprise rather than simple headcount. Runlayer&#x27;s current focus is on enterprise and mid-market segments, but Berman noted that the company plans to introduce offerings in the future specifically \"scoped to smaller companies\".Integration: from IT to AI transformationRunlayer is designed to fit into the existing \"stack\" used by security and infrastructure teams. For engineering and IT teams, it can be deployed in the cloud, within a private virtual private cloud (VPC), or even on-premise. Every tool call is logged and auditable, with integrations that allow data to be exported to SIEM vendors like Datadog or Splunk.During our interview, Berman highlighted the positive cultural shift that occurs when these tools are secured properly, rather than banned. He cited the example of Gusto, where the IT team was renamed the \"AI transformation team\" after partnering with Runlayer. Berman said: \"We have taken their company from... not using these type of tools, to half the company on a daily basis using MCP, and it’s incredible\". He noted that this includes non-technical users, proving that safe AI adoption can scale across an entire workforce.Similarly, Berman shared a quote from a customer at home sales tech firm OpenDoor who claimed that \"hands down, the biggest quality of life improvement I&#x27;m noticing at OpenDoor is Runlayer\" because it allowed them to connect agents to sensitive, private systems without fear of compromise.The path forward for agentic AIThe market response appears to validate the need for this \"middle ground\" in AI governance. Runlayer already powers security for several high-growth companies, including Gusto, Instacart, Homebase, and AngelList. These early adopters suggest that the future of AI in the workplace may not be found in banning powerful tools, but in wrapping them in a layer of measurable, real-time governance.As the cost of tokens drops and the capabilities of models like \"Opus 4.5\" or \"GPT 5.2\" increase, the urgency for this infrastructure only grows. \"The question isn&#x27;t really whether enterprise will use agents,\" Berman concluded in our interview, \"it&#x27;s whether they can do it, how fast they can do it safely, or they&#x27;re going to just do it recklessly, and it&#x27;s going to be a disaster\". For the modern CISO, the goal is no longer to be the person who says \"no,\" but to be the enabler who brings a \"governed, safe, and secure way to roll out AI\".",

          "standfirst": "Samsung’s 2025 was filled with new foldables, an ultra-thin new form factor and the launch of Google's XR platform. After making some announcements at CES 2026, the company has announced its first Galaxy Unpacked of the year will take place on February 25, where it is expected to introduce the Galaxy S26 lineup. Official invites have been shared, but actual information on what devices are arriving then is still not completely confirmed. But as usual, we know a lot about what’s expected at Unpacked.Engadget will be covering Galaxy Unpacked live from San Francisco next week, and we'll most likely have hands-on coverage of Samsung's new smartphones soon after they're announced. While we wait for the full details, here's everything we expect Samsung will introduce at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026.When is Unpacked 2026 taking place?According to the official invite that Samsung shared on February 10, Unpacked will happen on February 25, 2026 in San Francisco. The keynote will start at 10AM PT (1PM ET) and be livestreamed on Samsung.com, as well as the company’s newsroom and YouTube channel. The announcement on February 10 also said this launch will mark “a new phase in the era of AI as intelligence becomes truly personal and adaptive.” It’s not a lot to go on, since we’ve heard a version of this from various companies over the last few years, but at least we won’t be shocked when we hear more about AI in just about two weeks.Galaxy S26, S26+ and S26 UltraSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on photoPhoto by Sam Rutherford/EngadgetSamsung's restrained approach to updating its phones will likely continue with the Galaxy S26. Based on leaked images of the new lineup, the company is not expected to radically reinvent the look of the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ or Galaxy S26 Ultra, and instead will stick with a similar design to what it used on the Galaxy S25. The phones will have a flat front screen and frame, with rounded corners and cameras housed in a vertical pill-shaped plateau on the back. Unlike Apple's move from the iPhone 16 Pro to the iPhone 17 Pro, the biggest difference here will likely be internal components like the screens, chips and camera sensors Samsung uses.Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip is expected to be in all Samsung Galaxy S26 phones, though Korean news site Yonhap News reports Samsung's relatively new Exynos 2600 chip could be used in some phones in the lineup depending on the region, a strategy Samsung has deployed in the past. Either way the new phones should be more performant than the previous generation, and in the case of the models with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, particularly good at on-device AI processing.I have compiled the most accurate comprehensive parameter comparison of Galaxy S25, S25+ and Galaxy S26、 S26+. Which one do you want to buy? pic.twitter.com/aQpoSvYjOz— Ice Universe (@UniverseIce) November 29, 2025One notable difference between the Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S25 could be the phone's screen. The new phone will reportedly feature a 6.3-inch FHD+ display according to specs shared by leaker Ice Universe, which makes it ever so slightly larger than the 6.2-inch display used on the Galaxy S25. The S26 will also allegedly come with 12GB of RAM, either 256GB or 512GB of storage and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery. Samsung isn't changing the cameras on the entry-level phone, though: leaks suggest it'll feature the same 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie camera as the previous generation. Changes appear to be even more minor on the Galaxy S26+. Other than the new Snapdragon chip, the phone will reportedly feature the same 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 4,900mAh battery, 12GB of RAM and the same camera array used on the base Galaxy S26.The difference between the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra is reportedly a bit clearer. According to Android Headlines, the new phone's cameras will be slightly more raised, and stand out thanks to a new metallic finish. Samsung may also switch back to using an aluminum frame on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, after using titanium frames on both the Galaxy S24 and S25 Ultras. Most importantly, to make the phone actually support Qi2 rather than only technically work with the standard when a case is attached, rumors suggest Samsung will remove the S Pen digitizer layer in the phone and adopt a new method for accepting stylus input. It's not clear what that new method will actually be, but it could let the Galaxy S26 Ultra more easily work with Qi2 accessories without losing its stylus.Android Headlines also recently shared what appear to be full image renders of the S26 series, and they generally line up with what has already been rumored, leaked and reported so far. If these pictures are accurate, they give us a clearer look at the camera bump and two color variants of the S26 Ultra.Fans of magnets may continue to be disappointed by Samsung if the latest rumors are accurate. Despite the launch of the Qi 2 wireless charging standard adding support for convenient magnetic alignment years ago, Samsung has yet to bring that feature to its phones. Though the S-series have the higher speed charging rates that the spec enables, Nieuwemobiel.nl is reporting that, due to images it received of cases with magnetic rings, the S26 series likely won’t have built-in magnets. Samsung has made these cases to add the magnetic capability to its S-series in the past, and the existence of the images of these accessories lends weight to the idea that the company will continue this approach.Galaxy Buds 4Galaxy Buds 3 Pro in case.EngadgetSamsung released the Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro in 2024, with a major redesign that brought them much more in line with Apple's AirPods. The Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro Samsung is rumored to be announcing soon won't necessarily change that, though they will feature a more compact case and less angular stems, according to leaked images from the Samsung Tips app.Support for head gestures to accept and decline calls, a feature Apple includes on the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4, is also rumored to work on both versions of the new Galaxy Buds. SamMobile reports the Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro may also ship with a new Ultra Wideband chip that will make them easier to find with Google's Find Hub network.Galaxy Z TrifoldYes, the TriFold has a crease, two in fact. But they still don't ruin the experience. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetSamsung announced the Galaxy Z TriFold in late 2025 without firm details of when the new smartphone-that-folds-into-a-tablet would be available in North America. That info came on January 27, when the company announced the TriFold would be available in the US on January 30, for a whopping $2,900. Considering we’ve already seen the device in person at CES 2026 and people are most likely to have had a chance to look at, if not buy the foldable for themselves by the time Unpacked rolls around, we don’t expect Samsung to spend too much time dwelling on it, if at all.Galaxy S26 EdgeAt just 5.8mm thick, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is one of the thinnest smartphones ever made. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetWhen the Galaxy S25 Edge was announced in 2025, it seemed possible that Samsung could replace its \"Plus\" smartphone with a unique form factor, just like Apple has opted to do with the iPhone Air. There have been conflicting reports on the matter, but it seems like Samsung will not be doing that with the Galaxy S26 Edge.Instead, the smartphone will reportedly remain another option, much like foldables are for customers not swayed by Samsung's traditional smartphones. The Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to feature a slightly different design than last year's model, according to Android Headlines, with a large rectangular camera plateau that's reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones, and the raised oval Apple used on the iPhone Air. Beyond that, the phone is also expected to be ever so slightly thinner at 5.5mm than the 5.8mm Galaxy S25 Edge.Bixby and other AI featuresSamsung already acts as a first place Google can show off new AI features for Android, but the company is reportedly exploring other AI partnerships, too. In June 2025, Bloomberg reported that Samsung was nearing a deal with Perplexity to integrate its AI-powered search engine across OneUI and its homegrown mobile browser. Perplexity already has a deal with Motorola on its Razr phones, so the only thing that would make a deal with Samsung unusual is the close relationship the company already has with Google.The company also accidentally announced a new version of its Bixby AI assistant, which will likely also be integrated with Perplexity and could serve as an alternative to Google Gemini. Both a new Bixby and a deeper integration with Perplexity seem like natural new software features to show off at Galaxy Unpacked.On February 17, Samsung teased some mobile AI photography features ahead of Unpacked. These expand the S-series’ existing image-editing tools by bringing the ability “to turn a photo from day to night in seconds, restore missing parts of objects in images, capture detailed photos in low light, and seamlessly merge multiple photos into a single, cohesive result.” A lot of these things are already possible in other photo-editing apps or even in the Google Photos app, but we’ll have to wait to see them in action on the S26 phones for more details on whether they’re different or more effective.Update, January 27 2026, 11:55AM ET: This story has been updated to reflect the latest news around the Galaxy Z TriFold’s price and availability in the US.Update, January 30 2026, 12:45PM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks on the possible dates for Unpacked 2026.Update, February 02 2026, 11:30AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks with full image renders of the S26 trio of devices.Update, February 03 2026, 11:00AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks about the possible lack of magnetic support on the S26 series.Update, February 10 2026, 7:15PM ET: This story has been updated to include the official date of Galaxy Unpacked as Samsung announced it today.

Unlike Apple's move from the iPhone 16 Pro to the iPhone 17 Pro, the biggest difference here will likely be internal components like the screens, chips and camera sensors Samsung uses.Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip is expected to be in all Samsung Galaxy S26 phones, though Korean news site Yonhap News reports Samsung's relatively new Exynos 2600 chip could be used in some phones in the lineup depending on the region, a strategy Samsung has deployed in the past. Either way the new phones should be more performant than the previous generation, and in the case of the models with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, particularly good at on-device AI processing.I have compiled the most accurate comprehensive parameter comparison of Galaxy S25, S25+ and Galaxy S26、 S26+. Which one do you want to buy? pic.twitter.com/aQpoSvYjOz— Ice Universe (@UniverseIce) November 29, 2025One notable difference between the Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S25 could be the phone's screen. The new phone will reportedly feature a 6.3-inch FHD+ display according to specs shared by leaker Ice Universe, which makes it ever so slightly larger than the 6.2-inch display used on the Galaxy S25. The S26 will also allegedly come with 12GB of RAM, either 256GB or 512GB of storage and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery. Samsung isn't changing the cameras on the entry-level phone, though: leaks suggest it'll feature the same 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie camera as the previous generation. Changes appear to be even more minor on the Galaxy S26+. Other than the new Snapdragon chip, the phone will reportedly feature the same 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 4,900mAh battery, 12GB of RAM and the same camera array used on the base Galaxy S26.The difference between the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra is reportedly a bit clearer. According to Android Headlines, the new phone's cameras will be slightly more raised, and stand out thanks to a new metallic finish. Samsung may also switch back to using an aluminum frame on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, after using titanium frames on both the Galaxy S24 and S25 Ultras. Most importantly, to make the phone actually support Qi2 rather than only technically work with the standard when a case is attached, rumors suggest Samsung will remove the S Pen digitizer layer in the phone and adopt a new method for accepting stylus input. It's not clear what that new method will actually be, but it could let the Galaxy S26 Ultra more easily work with Qi2 accessories without losing its stylus.Android Headlines also recently shared what appear to be full image renders of the S26 series, and they generally line up with what has already been rumored, leaked and reported so far. If these pictures are accurate, they give us a clearer look at the camera bump and two color variants of the S26 Ultra.Fans of magnets may continue to be disappointed by Samsung if the latest rumors are accurate. Despite the launch of the Qi 2 wireless charging standard adding support for convenient magnetic alignment years ago, Samsung has yet to bring that feature to its phones. Though the S-series have the higher speed charging rates that the spec enables, Nieuwemobiel.nl is reporting that, due to images it received of cases with magnetic rings, the S26 series likely won’t have built-in magnets. Samsung has made these cases to add the magnetic capability to its S-series in the past, and the existence of the images of these accessories lends weight to the idea that the company will continue this approach.Galaxy Buds 4Galaxy Buds 3 Pro in case.EngadgetSamsung released the Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro in 2024, with a major redesign that brought them much more in line with Apple's AirPods. The Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro Samsung is rumored to be announcing soon won't necessarily change that, though they will feature a more compact case and less angular stems, according to leaked images from the Samsung Tips app.Support for head gestures to accept and decline calls, a feature Apple includes on the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4, is also rumored to work on both versions of the new Galaxy Buds. SamMobile reports the Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro may also ship with a new Ultra Wideband chip that will make them easier to find with Google's Find Hub network.Galaxy Z TrifoldYes, the TriFold has a crease, two in fact. But they still don't ruin the experience. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetSamsung announced the Galaxy Z TriFold in late 2025 without firm details of when the new smartphone-that-folds-into-a-tablet would be available in North America. That info came on January 27, when the company announced the TriFold would be available in the US on January 30, for a whopping $2,900. Considering we’ve already seen the device in person at CES 2026 and people are most likely to have had a chance to look at, if not buy the foldable for themselves by the time Unpacked rolls around, we don’t expect Samsung to spend too much time dwelling on it, if at all.Galaxy S26 EdgeAt just 5.8mm thick, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is one of the thinnest smartphones ever made. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetWhen the Galaxy S25 Edge was announced in 2025, it seemed possible that Samsung could replace its \"Plus\" smartphone with a unique form factor, just like Apple has opted to do with the iPhone Air. There have been conflicting reports on the matter, but it seems like Samsung will not be doing that with the Galaxy S26 Edge.Instead, the smartphone will reportedly remain another option, much like foldables are for customers not swayed by Samsung's traditional smartphones. The Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to feature a slightly different design than last year's model, according to Android Headlines, with a large rectangular camera plateau that's reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones, and the raised oval Apple used on the iPhone Air. Beyond that, the phone is also expected to be ever so slightly thinner at 5.5mm than the 5.8mm Galaxy S25 Edge.Bixby and other AI featuresSamsung already acts as a first place Google can show off new AI features for Android, but the company is reportedly exploring other AI partnerships, too. In June 2025, Bloomberg reported that Samsung was nearing a deal with Perplexity to integrate its AI-powered search engine across OneUI and its homegrown mobile browser. Perplexity already has a deal with Motorola on its Razr phones, so the only thing that would make a deal with Samsung unusual is the close relationship the company already has with Google.The company also accidentally announced a new version of its Bixby AI assistant, which will likely also be integrated with Perplexity and could serve as an alternative to Google Gemini. Both a new Bixby and a deeper integration with Perplexity seem like natural new software features to show off at Galaxy Unpacked.On February 17, Samsung teased some mobile AI photography features ahead of Unpacked. These expand the S-series’ existing image-editing tools by bringing the ability “to turn a photo from day to night in seconds, restore missing parts of objects in images, capture detailed photos in low light, and seamlessly merge multiple photos into a single, cohesive result.” A lot of these things are already possible in other photo-editing apps or even in the Google Photos app, but we’ll have to wait to see them in action on the S26 phones for more details on whether they’re different or more effective.Update, January 27 2026, 11:55AM ET: This story has been updated to reflect the latest news around the Galaxy Z TriFold’s price and availability in the US.Update, January 30 2026, 12:45PM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks on the possible dates for Unpacked 2026.Update, February 02 2026, 11:30AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks with full image renders of the S26 trio of devices.Update, February 03 2026, 11:00AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks about the possible lack of magnetic support on the S26 series.Update, February 10 2026, 7:15PM ET: This story has been updated to include the official date of Galaxy Unpacked as Samsung announced it today.

          "standfirst": "For four weeks starting January 21, Microsoft&#x27;s Copilot read and summarized confidential emails despite every sensitivity label and DLP policy telling it not to. The enforcement points broke inside Microsoft’s own pipeline, and no security tool in the stack flagged it. Among the affected organizations was the U.K.&#x27;s National Health Service, which logged it as INC46740412 — a signal of how far the failure reached into regulated healthcare environments. Microsoft tracked it as CW1226324. The advisory, first reported by BleepingComputer on February 18, marks the second time in eight months that Copilot’s retrieval pipeline violated its own trust boundary — a failure in which an AI system accesses or transmits data it was explicitly restricted from touching. The first was worse.In June 2025, Microsoft patched CVE-2025-32711, a critical zero-click vulnerability that Aim Security researchers dubbed “EchoLeak.” One malicious email bypassed Copilot’s prompt injection classifier, its link redaction, its Content-Security-Policy, and its reference mentions to silently exfiltrate enterprise data. No clicks and no user action were required. Microsoft assigned it a CVSS score of 9.3.Two different root causes; one blind spot: A code error and a sophisticated exploit chain produced an identical outcome. Copilot processed data it was explicitly restricted from touching, and the security stack saw nothing.Why EDR and WAF continue to be architecturally blind to thisEndpoint detection and response (EDR) monitors file and process behavior. Web application firewalls (WAFs) inspect HTTP payloads. Neither has a detection category for “your AI assistant just violated its own trust boundary.” That gap exists because LLM retrieval pipelines sit behind an enforcement layer that traditional security tools were never designed to observe.Copilot ingested a labeled email it was told to skip, and the entire action happened inside Microsoft&#x27;s infrastructure. Between the retrieval index and the generation model. Nothing dropped to disk, no anomalous traffic crossed the perimeter, and no process spawned for an endpoint agent to flag. The security stack reported all-clear because it never saw the layer where the violation occurred.The CW1226324 bug worked because a code-path error allowed messages in Sent Items and Drafts to enter Copilot’s retrieval set despite sensitivity labels and DLP rules that should have blocked them, according to Microsoft’s advisory. EchoLeak worked because Aim Security’s researchers proved that a malicious email, phrased to look like ordinary business correspondence, could manipulate Copilot’s retrieval-augmented generation pipeline into accessing and transmitting internal data to an attacker-controlled server.Aim Security&#x27;s researchers characterized it as a fundamental design flaw: agents process trusted and untrusted data in the same thought process, making them structurally vulnerable to manipulation. That design flaw did not disappear when Microsoft patched EchoLeak. CW1226324 proves the enforcement layer around it can fail independently.The five-point audit that maps to both failure modesNeither failure triggered a single alert. Both were discovered through vendor advisory channels — not through SIEM, not through EDR, not through WAF. CW1226324 went public on February 18. Affected tenants had been exposed since January 21. Microsoft has not disclosed how many organizations were affected or what data was accessed during that window. For security leaders, that gap is the story: a four-week exposure inside a vendor&#x27;s inference pipeline, invisible to every tool in the stack, discovered only because Microsoft chose to publish an advisory.1. Test DLP enforcement against Copilot directly. CW1226324 existed for four weeks because no one tested whether Copilot actually honored sensitivity labels on Sent Items and Drafts. Create labeled test messages in controlled folders, query Copilot and confirm it cannot surface them. Run this test monthly. Configuration is not enforcement; the only proof is a failed retrieval attempt.2. Block external content from reaching Copilot’s context window. EchoLeak succeeded because a malicious email entered Copilot’s retrieval set and its injected instructions executed as if they were the user’s query. The attack bypassed four distinct defense layers: Microsoft’s cross-prompt injection classifier, external link redaction, Content-Security-Policy controls, and reference mention safeguards, according to Aim Security’s disclosure. Disable external email context in Copilot settings, and restrict Markdown rendering in AI outputs. This catches the prompt-injection class of failure by removing the attack surface entirely.3. Audit Purview logs for anomalous Copilot interactions during the January through February exposure window. Look for Copilot Chat queries that returned content from labeled messages between January 21 and mid-February 2026. Neither failure class produced alerts through existing EDR or WAF, so retrospective detection depends on Purview telemetry. If your tenant cannot reconstruct what Copilot accessed during the exposure window, document that gap formally. It matters for compliance. For any organization subject to regulatory examination, an undocumented AI data access gap during a known vulnerability window is an audit finding waiting to happen.4. Turn on Restricted Content Discovery for SharePoint sites with sensitive data. RCD removes sites from Copilot’s retrieval pipeline entirely. It works regardless of whether the trust violation comes from a code bug or an injected prompt, because the data never enters the context window in the first place. This is the containment layer that does not depend on the enforcement point that broke. For organizations handling sensitive or regulated data, RCD is not optional.5. Build an incident response playbook for vendor-hosted inference failures. Incident response (IR) playbooks need a new category: trust boundary violations inside the vendor’s inference pipeline. Define escalation paths. Assign ownership. Establish a monitoring cadence for vendor service health advisories that affect AI processing. Your SIEM will not catch the next one, either.The pattern that transfers beyond CopilotA 2026 survey by Cybersecurity Insiders found that 47% of CISOs and senior security leaders have already observed AI agents exhibit unintended or unauthorized behavior. Organizations are deploying AI assistants into production faster than they can build governance around them.That trajectory matters because this framework is not Copilot-specific. Any RAG-based assistant pulling from enterprise data runs through the same pattern: a retrieval layer selects content, an enforcement layer gates what the model can see, and a generation layer produces output. If the enforcement layer fails, the retrieval layer feeds restricted data to the model, and the security stack never sees it. Copilot, Gemini for Workspace, and any tool with retrieval access to internal documents carries the same structural risk.Run the five-point audit before your next board meeting. Start with labeled test messages in a controlled folder. If Copilot surfaces them, every policy underneath is theater. The board answer: “Our policies were configured correctly. Enforcement failed inside the vendor’s inference pipeline. Here are the five controls we are testing, restricting, and demanding before we re-enable full access for sensitive workloads.” The next failure will not send an alert.",

          "standfirst": "Indie publisher and developer Finji has accused TikTok of using generative AI to alter the ads for its games on the platform without its knowledge or permission. Finji, which published indie darlings like Night in the Woods and Tunic, said it only became aware of the seemingly modified ads after being alerted to them by followers of its official TikTok account. As reported by IGN, Finji alleges that one ad that went out on the platform was modified so it displayed a \"racist, sexualized\" representation of a character from one of its games. While it does advertise on TikTok, it told IGN that it has AI \"turned all the way off,\" but after CEO and co-founder Rebekah Saltsman received screenshots of the ads in question from fans, she approached TikTok to investigate. A number of Finji ads have appeared on TikTok, some that include montages of the company’s games, and others that are game-specific like this one for Usual June. According to IGN, the offending AI-modified ads (which are still posted as if they’re coming directly from Finji) appeared as slideshows. Some images don’t appear to be that different from the source, but one possibly AI-generated example seen by IGN depicts Usual June’s titular protagonist with \"a bikini bottom, impossibly large hips and thighs, and boots that rise up over her knees.\" Needless to say (and obvious from the official screenshot used as the lead image for this article), this is not how the character appears in the game. As for TikTok’s response, IGN printed a number of the platform’s replies to Finji’s complaints, in which it initially said, in part, that it could find no evidence that \"AI-generated assets or slideshow formats are being used.\" This was despite Finji sending the customer support page a screenshot of the clearly edited image mentioned above. In a subsequent exchange, TikTok appeared to acknowledge the evidence and assured the publisher it was \"no longer disputing whether this occurred.\" It added that it has escalated the issue internally and was investigating it thoroughly. TikTok does have a \"Smart Creative\" option on its ad platform, which essentially uses generative AI to modify user-created ads so that multiple versions are pushed out, with the ones its audience responds more positively to used more often. Another option is the “Automate Creative” features, which use AI to automatically optimize things like music, audio effects and general visual \"quality\" to \"enhance the user’s viewing experience.\" Saltsman showed IGN evidence that Finji has both of these options turned off, which was also confirmed by a TikTok agent for the ad in question. After a number of increasingly frustrated exchanges in which TikTok eventually admitted to Saltsman that the ad \"raises significant issues, including the unauthorized use of AI, the sexualization and misrepresentation of your characters, and the resulting commercial and reputational harm to your studio,\" the Finji co-founder was offered something of an explanation. TikTok said that Finji’s campaign used a \"catalog ads format\" designed to \"demonstrate the performance benefits of combining carousel and video assets in Sales campaigns.\" It said that this \"initiative\" helped advertisers \"achieve better results with less effort,\" but did not address the harmful content directly. Finji seemingly also opted into this ad format without knowing it had done so. TikTok declined to comment on the matter when approached by IGN. Saltsman was told the issue could not be escalated any higher, with communication not resolved at the time of IGN publishing its report. In a statement to the outlet, Saltsman said she was \"a bit shocked by TikTok’s complete lack of appropriate response to the mess they made.\" She went on to say that she expected both an apology and clear reassurance of how a similar issue would not reoccur, but was \"obviously not holding my breath for any of the above.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/tunic-publisher-claims-tiktok-ran-racist-sexist-ai-ads-for-one-of-its-games-without-its-knowledge-185303395.html?src=rss",

I think that’s what everyone’s reading into the lemon-and-lime tinged invitation. I’m very much up for a return of the colorful Mac. The first Mac I ever used was one of those bubbly orange iMacs, interning at a video-game magazine. Yes, a magazine.

The streamer has had to pluck fighters out of retirement because more contemporary stars are under contract with various promotional entities.

Engadget The worst-kept secret in value-for-money phones remains Google’s Pixel A series. In recent years, the Android phone series has offered a great balance of specs, hardware design and software features that embarrass most phones in the same price point. Its camera performance is often better than devices that cost several hundred dollars more. It’s more of the same with the Pixel 10a.

The best budget models strike a great balance between price and performance, giving you smooth everyday use without cutting too many corners. Whether you’re scrolling social media, streaming your favorite shows or snapping photos of a night out, there’s an affordable Android phone that can handle it all.Cheaper phones have come a long way in recent years. Many now feature bright, fast displays, reliable cameras and battery life that lasts well into the next day. You might miss out on top-tier extras like the latest processor or ultra-high-resolution zoom, but what you get instead is value that makes sense. Some models even surprise with cameras that rival far pricier flagships, making them ideal for casual photographers or anyone who just wants to capture a great shot on the go.We’ve tested budget Android phones from brands like Google, Samsung and OnePlus to find the ones that deliver the most for less. These are the models that prove you don’t need a flagship price tag to get a dependable Android phone. Best budget Android phones for 2026 How cheap should you go for an Android phone? We tend to define a budget smartphone as costing between $150 and $350. Any lower and the device runs the risk of suffering from too many compromises in function, and above that, you cross over to pricier midrange handsets (if you're open to spending more, we shouted out a couple of our favorite flagship phones at the very end of this guide). But for those with a little wiggle room, there are some things to consider. For example, a child may be better off with a cheaper device, especially if it’s intended mainly for emergencies, WiFi browsing or texting parents (and not social media). On the higher end of this price spectrum, sub-$350 Samsung phones and other Android devices have come a long way thanks to improved performance, better phone cameras with low-light capabilities, fast charging, and nicer displays like AMOLED panels. This makes them a viable alternative to, say, a flagship handset with a premium design, even if you have the flexibility to spend more. What to look for in a cheap Android phone When it comes to cheap phones, you get what you pay for. Most smartphones in this price range are made out of plastic, though the fit and finish of a specific model can vary a lot based on price. A bright screen is also important. Typically you’ll get LCD panels with a 60Hz or 90Hz refresh rate, but some phones may have OLED or AMOLED screens with increased color saturation. Long battery life is critical as well, so we tend to favor devices with larger power cells of around 5,000 mAh. In this price range, performance can vary a lot, so look for devices with at least 8GB of RAM and processors that can deliver stutter-free visuals. It’s also important to consider support length: as periodic security updates and lengthy software support can extend the longevity of your device, which will save you money in the long run. Android phone FAQs What's the price difference for a cheap Android vs a cheap iPhone? iPhones tend to be more expensive compared to Android phones — even the cheapest iPhone, the iPhone SE, which starts from $429, is a harder pill to swallow compared to a cheap Android phone. In contrast, you can get your hands on a cheap Android device for as low as $100.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-cheap-android-phone-160029703.html?src=rss",

Some of NIST’s recent work includes establishing guidelines for securing AI systems and identifying health concerns with air purifiers and firefighting gloves. Many of the agency’s thousands of employees, postdoctoral scientists, contractors, and guest researchers are brought in from around the world for their specialized expertise. “For weeks now, rumors of draconian new measures have been spreading like wildfire, while my staff’s inquiries to NIST have gone unanswered,” Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, wrote in a letter sent to acting NIST Director Craig Burkhardt on Thursday.

          "content": "When dinosaur fossils surface at a site, it is often not possible to tell how many millions of years ago their bones were buried. While the different strata of sedimentary rock represent periods of geologic history frozen in time, accurately dating them or the fossils trapped within them has frequently proven to be frustrating. Fossilized bones and teeth have been dated with some success before, but that success is inconsistent and depends on the specimens. Both fossilization and the process of sediment turning to rock can alter the bone in ways that interfere with accuracy. While uranium-lead dating is among the most widely used methods for dating materials, it is just an emerging technology when applied to directly dating fossils. Dinosaur eggshells might have finally cracked a way to date surrounding rocks and fossils. Led by paleontologist Ryan Tucker of Stellenbosch University, a team of researchers has devised a method of dating eggshells that reveals how long ago they were covered in what was once sand, mud, or other sediments. That information will give the burial time of any other fossils embedded in the same layer of rock.Read full article Comments",

But they disagree on whether studying social genomics—elucidating any potential genetic contributions to behaviors ranging from mental illnesses to educational attainment to political affiliation—can help achieve this goal. Martschenko’s argument is largely that genetic research and data have almost always been used thus far as a justification to further entrench extant social inequalities. But we know the solutions to many of the injustices in our world—trying to lift people out of poverty, for example—and we certainly don’t need more genetic research to implement them. Trejo’s point is largely that more information is generally better than less. We can’t foresee the benefits that could come from basic research, and this research is happening anyway, whether we like it or not, so we may as well try to harness it as best we can toward good and not ill. Obviously, they’re both right. In What We Inherit: How New Technologies and Old Myths Are Shaping Our Genomic Future, we get to see how their collaboration can shed light on our rapidly advancing genetic capabilities.Read full article Comments",

It shocked many that Discord would be so bold so soon after a third-party breach of a former age check partner's services recently exposed 70,000 Discord users' government IDs. Attempting to reassure users, Discord claimed that most users wouldn't have to show ID, instead relying on video selfies using AI to estimate ages, which raised separate privacy concerns. In the future, perhaps behavioral signals would override the need for age checks for most users, Discord suggested, seemingly downplaying the risk that sensitive data would be improperly stored.Read full article Comments",

The bombastic tri-motor \"Cyberbeast\" is $15,000 cheaper at $99,990, albeit by dropping some previously free features like supercharging and FSD. And there's now a new $59,990 entry-level model, a dual-motor configuration with a range of 325 miles (523 km) and the same 4.1-second 0–60 mph (0-97 km/h) time as the $79,990 premium all-wheel drive version. That actually makes the new entry-level model a good deal, at least in terms of Cybertrucks. Last year, the company introduced and then eliminated a single-motor rear-wheel drive variant, which found few takers when priced at $69,990; an extra motor for $10,000 less is quite a savings, and actually slightly cheaper than the price originally advertised for the RWD truck. As you might expect, Tesla has made some changes to get down to the new price. The range and 0–60 mph time might be the same as the more expensive dual-motor Cybertruck, but towing capacity is reduced from 11,000 lbs (4,990 kg) to 7,000 lbs (3,175kg), and cargo capacity drops from 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg) to 2,006 lbs (910 kg).Read full article Comments",

Amazon Web Services experienced a 13-hour interruption to one system used by its customers in mid-December after engineers allowed its Kiro AI coding tool to make certain changes, according to four people familiar with the matter. The people said the agentic tool, which can take autonomous actions on behalf of users, determined that the best course of action was to “delete and recreate the environment.”Read full article Comments",

Bhattacharya's new role comes amid a leadership shakeup in the Department of Health and Human Services under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It also marks the third leader for the beleaguered public health agency under Kennedy. Susan Monarez, a microbiologist and long-time federal health official, held the position of acting director before becoming the first Senate-confirmed CDC director at the end of July. But she was in the role just shy of a month before Kennedy ousted her for—according to Monarez—refusing to rubber-stamp changes to vaccine recommendations made by Kennedy's hand-picked advisors, who are overwhelmingly anti-vaccine themselves.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "For a long time now, PC gamers have been used to the Final Fantasy series treating their platform as somewhat secondary to the game's core console versions. There are some signs that may be starting to change, though, as director Naoki Hamaguchi has confirmed that the PC is now the \"lead platform\" for development of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy. In a recent interview with Automaton, Hamaguchi clarified that the team takes the relatively common practice of creating visual assets for its multiplatform games by targeting \"high-end environments first,\" then performing a \"reduction\" for less powerful platforms. These days, that means \"our 3D assets are created at the highest quality level based on PC as the foundation,\" he said. Players have already noticed this graphical difference in the PC version of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Hamaguchi said, and \"our philosophy will not change for the third installment.\" While PC gaming is only \"gradually expanding in Japan,\" Hamaguchi said the rapid growth in international PC gamers has led the company to \"develop assets with the broad PC market in mind.\"Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Two skulls from Yunxian, in northern China, aren’t ancestors of Denisovans after all; they’re actually the oldest known Homo erectus fossils in eastern Asia. A recent study has re-dated the skulls to about 1.77 million years old, which makes them the oldest hominin remains found so far in East Asia. Their age means that Homo erectus (an extinct common ancestor of our species, Neanderthals, and Denisovans) must have spread across the continent much earlier and much faster than we’d previously given them credit for. It also sheds new light on who was making stone tools at some even older archaeological sites in China. Homo erectus spread like wildfire Yunxian is an important—and occasionally contentious—archaeological site on the banks of central China’s Han River. Along with hundreds of stone tools and animal bones, the layers of river sediment have yielded three nearly complete hominin skulls (only two of which have been described in a publication so far). Shantou University paleoanthropologist Hua Tu and his colleagues measured the ratio of two isotopes, aluminum-26 and beryllium-10, in grains of quartz from the sediment layer that once held the skulls. The results suggest that Homo erectus lived and died along the Han River 1.77 million years ago. That's just 130,000 years after the species first appeared in Africa.Read full article Comments",

The series is set nearly 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, when dragons were still a fixture of Westeros, and chronicles the beginning of the end of House Targaryen’s reign. The primary source material is Fire and Blood, a fictional history of the Targaryen kings written by George R.R. Martin. As book readers know, those events culminated in a civil war and the extinction of the dragons—at least until Daenerys Targaryen came along.Read full article Comments",

They fixed most of the bugs and balance issues present in the originals—partly by also including the rosters from Gold/Silver and Ruby/Sapphire—but they're more faithful to the original gameplay, battling and catching mechanics, and graphics than the 2018 Let's Go, Pikachu/Eevee! adaptations for the Switch. Someone at Nintendo apparently agrees, as the company announced today that it's re-releasing those games for the original Switch (and, by extension, the Switch 2, though no Switch 2-specific features were announced). The games will be available after a planned Pokémon Presents stream at 9 am Eastern/6 am Pacific on February 27. Subscribers to the Switch Online + Expansion Pack are in for a disappointment, though. Instead of releasing FireRed and LeafGreen as part of the Switch Online Game Boy Advance collection, Nintendo will release both titles as standalone purchases that will run you $20 apiece. This means that players without a subscription will be able to buy and play the games. But given how few GBA games are available for the Switch Online service and how infrequently new ones are released, it does rankle to see otherwise unmodified ports of a prominent game bypass subscribers entirely.Read full article Comments",
