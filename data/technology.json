          "standfirst": "Traditional software governance often uses static compliance checklists, quarterly audits and after-the-fact reviews. But this method can&#x27;t keep up with AI systems that change in real time. A machine learning (ML) model might retrain or drift between quarterly operational syncs. This means that, by the time an issue is discovered, hundreds of bad decisions could already have been made. This can be almost impossible to untangle. In the fast-paced world of AI, governance must be inline, not an after-the-fact compliance review. In other words, organizations must adopt what I call an “audit loop\": A continuous, integrated compliance process that operates in real-time alongside AI development and deployment, without halting innovation. This article explains how to implement such continuous AI compliance through shadow mode rollouts, drift and misuse monitoring and audit logs engineered for direct legal defensibility.From reactive checks to an inline “audit loop”When systems moved at the speed of people, it made sense to do compliance checks every so often. But AI doesn&#x27;t wait for the next review meeting. The change to an inline audit loop means audits will no longer occur just once in a while; they happen all the time. Compliance and risk management should be \"baked in\" to the AI lifecycle from development to production, rather than just post-deployment. This means establishing live metrics and guardrails that monitor AI behavior as it occurs and raise red flags as soon as something seems off. For instance, teams can set up drift detectors that automatically alert when a model&#x27;s predictions go off course from the training distribution, or when confidence scores fall below acceptable levels. Governance is no longer just a set of quarterly snapshots; it&#x27;s a streaming process with alerts that go off in real time when a system goes outside of its defined confidence bands.Cultural shift is equally important: Compliance teams must act less like after-the-fact auditors and more like AI co-pilots. In practice, this might mean compliance and AI engineers working together to define policy guardrails and continuously monitor key indicators. With the right tools and mindset, real-time AI governance can “nudge” and intervene early, helping teams course-correct without slowing down innovation. In fact, when done well, continuous governance builds trust rather than friction, providing shared visibility into AI operations for both builders and regulators, instead of unpleasant surprises after deployment. The following strategies illustrate how to achieve this balance.Shadow mode rollouts: Testing compliance safelyOne effective framework for continuous AI compliance is “shadow mode” deployments with new models or agent features. This means a new AI system is deployed in parallel with the existing system, receiving real production inputs but not influencing real decisions or user-facing outputs. The legacy model or process continues to handle decisions, while the new AI’s outputs are captured only for analysis. This provides a safe sandbox to vet the AI’s behavior under real conditions. According to global law firm Morgan Lewis: “Shadow-mode operation requires the AI to run in parallel without influencing live decisions until its performance is validated,” giving organizations a safe environment to test changes. Teams can discover problems early by comparing the shadow model&#x27;s decisions to expectations (the current model&#x27;s decisions). For instance, when a model is running in shadow mode, they can check to see if its inputs and predictions differ from those of the current production model or the patterns seen in training. Sudden changes could indicate bugs in the data pipeline, unexpected bias or drops in performance. In short, shadow mode is a way to check compliance in real time: It ensures that the model handles inputs correctly and meets policy standards (accuracy, fairness) before it is fully released. One AI security framework showed how this method worked: Teams first ran AI in shadow mode (AI makes suggestions but doesn&#x27;t act on its own), then compared AI and human inputs to determine trust. They only let the AI suggest actions with human approval after it was reliable. For instance, Prophet Security eventually let the AI make low-risk decisions on its own. Using phased rollouts gives people confidence that an AI system meets requirements and works as expected, without putting production or customers at risk during testing. Real-time drift and misuse detectionEven after an AI model is fully deployed, the compliance job is never \"done.\" Over time, AI systems can drift, meaning that their performance or outputs change due to new data patterns, model retraining or bad inputs. They can also be misused or lead to results that go against policy (for example, inappropriate content or biased decisions) in unexpected ways. To remain compliant, teams must set up monitoring signals and processes to catch these issues as they happen. In SLA monitoring, they may only check for uptime or latency. In AI monitoring, however, the system must be able to tell when outputs are not what they should be. For example, if a model suddenly starts giving biased or harmful results. This means setting \"confidence bands\" or quantitative limits for how a model should behave and setting automatic alerts when those limits are crossed.Some signals to monitor include:Data or concept drift: When input data distributions change significantly or model predictions diverge from training-time patterns. For example, a model’s accuracy on certain segments might drop as the incoming data shifts, a sign to investigate and possibly retrain.Anomalous or harmful outputs: When outputs trigger policy violations or ethical red flags. An AI content filter might flag if a generative model produces disallowed content, or a bias monitor might detect if decisions for a protected group begin to skew negatively. Contracts for AI services now often require vendors to detect and address such noncompliant results promptly.User misuse patterns: When unusual usage behavior suggests someone is trying to manipulate or misuse the AI. For instance, rapid-fire queries attempting prompt injection or adversarial inputs could be automatically flagged by the system’s telemetry as potential misuse.When a drift or misuse signal crosses a critical threshold, the system should support “intelligent escalation” rather than waiting for a quarterly review. In practice, this could mean triggering an automated mitigation or immediately alerting a human overseer. Leading organizations build in fail-safes like kill-switches, or the ability to suspend an AI’s actions the moment it behaves unpredictably or unsafely. For example, a service contract might allow a company to instantly pause an AI agent if it’s outputting suspect results, even if the AI provider hasn’t acknowledged a problem. Likewise, teams should have playbooks for rapid model rollback or retraining windows: If drift or errors are detected, there’s a plan to retrain the model (or revert to a safe state) within a defined timeframe. This kind of agile response is crucial; it recognizes that AI behavior may drift or degrade in ways that cannot be fixed with a simple patch, so swift retraining or tuning is part of the compliance loop.By continuously monitoring and reacting to drift and misuse signals, companies transform compliance from a periodic audit to an ongoing safety net. Issues are caught and addressed in hours or days, not months. The AI stays within acceptable bounds, and governance keeps pace with the AI’s own learning and adaptation, rather than trailing behind it. This not only protects users and stakeholders; it gives regulators and executives peace of mind that the AI is under constant watchful oversight, even as it evolves.Audit logs designed for legal defensibilityContinuous compliance also means continuously documenting what your AI is doing and why. Robust audit logs demonstrate compliance, both for internal accountability and external legal defensibility. However, logging for AI requires more than simplistic logs. Imagine an auditor or regulator asking: “Why did the AI make this decision, and did it follow approved policy?” Your logs should be able to answer that.A good AI audit log keeps a permanent, detailed record of every important action and decision AI makes, along with the reasons and context. Legal experts say these logs \"provide detailed, unchangeable records of AI system actions with exact timestamps and written reasons for decisions.\" They are important evidence in court. This means that every important inference, suggestion or independent action taken by AI should be recorded with metadata, such as timestamps, the model/version used, the input received, the output produced and (if possible) the reasoning or confidence behind that output. Modern compliance platforms stress logging not only the result (\"X action taken\") but also the rationale (\"X action taken because conditions Y and Z were met according to policy\"). These enhanced logs let an auditor see, for example, not just that an AI approved a user&#x27;s access, but that it was approved \"based on continuous usage and alignment with the user&#x27;s peer group,\" according to Attorney Aaron Hall.Audit logs should also be well-organized and difficult to change if they are to be legally sound. Techniques like immutable storage or cryptographic hashing of logs ensure that records can&#x27;t be changed. Log data should be protected by access controls and encryption so that sensitive information, such as security keys and personal data, is hidden or protected while still being open. In regulated industries, keeping these logs can show examiners that you are not only keeping track of AI&#x27;s outputs, but you are retaining records for review. Regulators are expecting companies to show more than that an AI was checked before it was released. They want to see that it is being monitored continuously and there is a forensic trail to analyze its behavior over time. This evidentiary backbone comes from complete audit trails that include data inputs, model versions and decision outputs. They make AI less of a \"black box\" and more of a system that can be tracked and held accountable.If there is a disagreement or an event (for example, an AI made a biased choice that hurt a customer), these logs are your legal lifeline. They help you figure out what went wrong. Was it a problem with the data, a model drift or misuse? Who was in charge of the process? Did we stick to the rules we set? Well-kept AI audit logs show that the company did its homework and had controls in place. This not only lowers the risk of legal problems but makes people more trusting of AI systems. With AI, teams and executives can be sure that every decision made is safe because it is open and accountable.Inline governance as an enabler, not a roadblockImplementing an “audit loop” of continuous AI compliance might sound like extra work, but in reality, it enables faster and safer AI delivery. By integrating governance into each stage of the AI lifecycle, from shadow mode trial runs to real-time monitoring to immutable logging, organizations can move quickly and responsibly. Issues are caught early, so they don’t snowball into major failures that require project-halting fixes later. Developers and data scientists can iterate on models without endless back-and-forth with compliance reviewers, because many compliance checks are automated and happen in parallel. Rather than slowing down delivery, this approach often accelerates it: Teams spend less time on reactive damage control or lengthy audits, and more time on innovation because they are confident that compliance is under control in the background.There are bigger benefits to continuous AI compliance, too. It gives end-users, business leaders and regulators a reason to believe that AI systems are being handled responsibly. When every AI decision is clearly recorded, watched and checked for quality, stakeholders are much more likely to accept AI solutions. This trust benefits the whole industry and society, not just individual businesses. An audit-loop governance model can stop AI failures and ensure AI behavior is in line with moral and legal standards. In fact, strong AI governance benefits the economy and the public because it encourages innovation and protection. It can unlock AI&#x27;s potential in important areas like finance, healthcare and infrastructure without putting safety or values at risk. As national and international standards for AI change quickly, U.S. companies that set a good example by always following the rules are at the forefront of trustworthy AI.People say that if your AI governance isn&#x27;t keeping up with your AI, it&#x27;s not really governance; it&#x27;s \"archaeology.\" Forward-thinking companies are realizing this and adopting audit loops. By doing so, they not only avoid problems but make compliance a competitive advantage, ensuring that faster delivery and better oversight go hand in hand.Dhyey Mavani is working to accelerate gen AI and computational mathematics.

          "title": "How to send a message via satellite on iPhone",
          "standfirst": "Apple’s satellite features were originally designed for emergencies, allowing iPhone users to contact emergency services when cellular and Wi-Fi coverage is unavailable. With recent versions of iOS, Apple has expanded those capabilities to include sending and receiving messages via satellite. This makes it possible to stay in touch with friends and family from remote locations where traditional networks do not reach, such as hiking trails, rural areas or offshore locations.Messaging via satellite is built directly into the iPhone and works automatically when no cellular or Wi-Fi signal is available. While it is not intended to replace regular messaging, it can be a useful backup when coverage drops.How to send a message via satelliteBefore you can get started, you’ll need to turn on iMessage before you’re off the grid. It’s also important to set up an emergency contact as well as members of your Family Sharing group prior to your departure. This will enable them to message you via SMS without the need to message them first. To send a message via satellite, open the Messages app when no cellular or Wi-Fi signal is available. If the feature is supported in the current location, the app will display a prompt indicating that satellite messaging is available.Selecting the option to connect via satellite launches a guided connection screen. Your iPhone will provide real-time instructions to help maintain alignment with the satellite. Once connected, a text message can be typed and sent, although delivery may take longer than usual.The iPhone will notify you when the message has been sent successfully. Replies from the recipient will also be delivered via satellite, as long as the connection remains active.What you need before you can send satellite messagesSending messages via satellite requires a compatible iPhone model and the correct software version. The feature is supported on iPhone models with satellite hardware, beginning with iPhone 14 and later. The device must be running a version of iOS (iOS 18 or higher) that supports satellite messaging, which Apple has continued to refine through recent iOS updates.The feature also depends on location and availability. Satellite messaging is currently supported in select regions, including the United States and parts of Canada, with expanded support rolling out gradually. The iPhone must be outdoors with a clear view of the sky, as trees, buildings and terrain can interfere with the satellite connection.Satellite messaging is not designed for continuous conversations. Messages are compressed and sent at a slower pace than standard texts, and delivery times can vary depending on conditions and satellite positioning.How satellite messaging works on iPhoneWhen an iPhone loses access to cellular and Wi-Fi networks, the system automatically detects that only satellite connectivity is available. Instead of failing to send, the Messages app prompts the user to connect to a satellite.On-screen instructions guide the user to position the phone correctly. This typically involves holding the device up and following directional prompts to align it with an overhead satellite. The phone uses built-in sensors to help maintain the connection while the message is being sent.Messages sent via satellite are text-only and use a reduced data format to ensure they can be transmitted reliably. Images, videos, audio messages and large attachments are not supported.Who can receive satellite messages?Satellite messages can be sent to contacts using iMessage or standard SMS, depending on the recipient’s device and settings. If the recipient is using an Apple device with iMessage enabled, the message will be delivered through Apple’s messaging system. If not, the message will be sent as a standard text.Recipients do not need a satellite-capable device to receive messages. From their perspective, the message appears similar to a regular text, though delivery times may be longer.Tips for getting a reliable connectionA clear view of the sky is essential for satellite messaging to work properly. Open areas with minimal obstructions offer the best results. Movement, heavy foliage and nearby structures can interrupt the connection.Because satellite bandwidth is limited, keeping messages short improves reliability and delivery speed. The iPhone may prompt the user to edit longer messages to fit within satellite constraints.Battery life is also a consideration. Maintaining a satellite connection uses more power than standard messaging, so it helps to conserve battery when relying on satellite features for extended periods.Limitations to keep in mindSatellite messaging is designed for occasional use when other networks are unavailable. It does not support group messages, media attachments or read receipts in the same way as standard messaging.Delivery times can range from under a minute to several minutes, depending on environmental conditions and satellite availability. The feature should not be relied upon for time-sensitive communication unless no other option is available.Apple has also noted that satellite features may be offered free for a limited period, with potential pricing or subscription requirements introduced in the future depending on region and carrier arrangements.When satellite messaging can be usefulMessaging via satellite can be helpful for travelers, hikers and anyone spending time in remote areas where coverage is unreliable. It offers a way to check in, share basic updates or request non-emergency assistance when traditional networks are unavailable.While it is not a replacement for emergency services, it complements Apple’s existing emergency satellite features by providing an additional communication option when users are off the grid.As Apple continues to expand satellite support, messaging via satellite is likely to become a more familiar part of the iPhone experience, particularly for users who regularly venture beyond the reach of cellular networks.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-send-a-message-via-satellite-on-iphone-130000418.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Apple’s satellite features were originally designed for emergencies, allowing iPhone users to contact emergency services when cellular and Wi-Fi coverage is unavailable. With recent versions of iOS, Apple has expanded those capabilities to include sending and receiving messages via satellite. This makes it possible to stay in touch with friends and family from remote locations where traditional networks do not reach, such as hiking trails, rural areas or offshore locations.Messaging via satellite is built directly into the iPhone and works automatically when no cellular or Wi-Fi signal is available. While it is not intended to replace regular messaging, it can be a useful backup when coverage drops.How to send a message via satelliteBefore you can get started, you’ll need to turn on iMessage before you’re off the grid. It’s also important to set up an emergency contact as well as members of your Family Sharing group prior to your departure. This will enable them to message you via SMS without the need to message them first. To send a message via satellite, open the Messages app when no cellular or Wi-Fi signal is available. If the feature is supported in the current location, the app will display a prompt indicating that satellite messaging is available.Selecting the option to connect via satellite launches a guided connection screen. Your iPhone will provide real-time instructions to help maintain alignment with the satellite. Once connected, a text message can be typed and sent, although delivery may take longer than usual.The iPhone will notify you when the message has been sent successfully. Replies from the recipient will also be delivered via satellite, as long as the connection remains active.What you need before you can send satellite messagesSending messages via satellite requires a compatible iPhone model and the correct software version. The feature is supported on iPhone models with satellite hardware, beginning with iPhone 14 and later. The device must be running a version of iOS (iOS 18 or higher) that supports satellite messaging, which Apple has continued to refine through recent iOS updates.The feature also depends on location and availability. Satellite messaging is currently supported in select regions, including the United States and parts of Canada, with expanded support rolling out gradually. The iPhone must be outdoors with a clear view of the sky, as trees, buildings and terrain can interfere with the satellite connection.Satellite messaging is not designed for continuous conversations. Messages are compressed and sent at a slower pace than standard texts, and delivery times can vary depending on conditions and satellite positioning.How satellite messaging works on iPhoneWhen an iPhone loses access to cellular and Wi-Fi networks, the system automatically detects that only satellite connectivity is available.

          "standfirst": "A recent Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage that lasted 13 hours was reportedly caused by one of its own AI tools, according to reporting by Financial Times. This happened in December after engineers deployed the Kiro AI coding tool to make certain changes, say four people familiar with the matter. Kiro is an agentic tool, meaning it can take autonomous actions on behalf of users. In this case, the bot reportedly determined that it needed to \"delete and recreate the environment.\" This is what allegedly led to the lengthy outage that primarily impacted China. Amazon says it was merely a \"coincidence that AI tools were involved\" and that \"the same issue could occur with any developer tool or manual action.\" The company blamed the outage on \"user error, not AI error.\" It said that by default the Kiro tool “requests authorization before taking any action” but that the staffer involved in the December incident had \"broader permissions than expected — a user access control issue, not an AI autonomy issue.\" Multiple Amazon employees spoke to Financial Times and noted that this was \"at least\" the second occasion in recent months in which the company's AI tools were at the center of a service disruption. \"The outages were small but entirely foreseeable,\" said one senior AWS employee. A builder shares why their workflow finally clicked.Instead of jumping straight to code, the IDE pushed them to start with specs.✔️ Clear requirements.✔️ Acceptance criteria.✔️ Traceable tasks.Their takeaway:Think first.

Leadership set an 80 percent weekly use goal and has been closely tracking adoption rates. Amazon also sells access to the agentic tool for a monthly subscription fee. These recent outages follow a more serious event from October, in which a 15-hour AWS outage disrupted services like Alexa, Snapchat, Fortnite and Venmo, among others. The company blamed a bug in its automation software for that one. However, Amazon disagrees with the characterization of certain products and services being unavailable as an outage. In response to the Financial Times report, the company shared the following statement, which it also published on its news blog: We want to address the inaccuracies in the Financial Times' reporting yesterday. The brief service interruption they reported on was the result of user error—specifically misconfigured access controls—not AI as the story claims. The disruption was an extremely limited event last December affecting a single service (AWS Cost Explorer—which helps customers visualize, understand, and manage AWS costs and usage over time) in one of our 39 Geographic Regions around the world. It did not impact compute, storage, database, AI technologies, or any other of the hundreds of services that we run. The issue stemmed from a misconfigured role—the same issue that could occur with any developer tool (AI powered or not) or manual action. We did not receive any customer inquiries regarding the interruption. We implemented numerous safeguards to prevent this from happening again—not because the event had a big impact (it didn't), but because we insist on learning from our operational experience to improve our security and resilience. Additional safeguards include mandatory peer review for production access. While operational incidents involving misconfigured access controls can occur with any developer tool—AI-powered or not—we think it is important to learn from these experiences. The Financial Times' claim that a second event impacted AWS is entirely false. For more than two decades, Amazon has achieved high operational excellence with our Correction of Error (COE) process. We review these together so that we can learn from any incident, irrespective of customer impact, to address issues before their potential impact grows larger.

          "standfirst": "Apple’s AirTag is designed to help people keep track of personal belongings like keys, bags and luggage. But because AirTags and other Bluetooth trackers are small and discreet, concerns about unwanted tracking are understandable. Apple has spent years building safeguards into the AirTag and the Find My network to reduce the risk of misuse and to alert people if a tracker they don’t own appears to be moving with them.If you’re worried about whether an AirTag or similar tracker might be following you, here’s how Apple’s unwanted tracking alerts work, what notifications to look for and what you can do on both iPhone and Android.How AirTag tracking alerts workAirTags, compatible Find My network accessories and certain AirPods models use Apple’s Find My network, which relies on Bluetooth signals and nearby devices to update their location. To prevent misuse, Apple designed these products with features that are meant to alert someone if a tracker that isn’t linked to their Apple Account appears to be traveling with them.If an AirTag or another compatible tracker is separated from its owner and detected near you over time, your device may display a notification or the tracker itself may emit a sound. These alerts are intended to discourage someone from secretly tracking another person without their knowledge. Apple has also worked with Google on a cross-platform industry standard, so alerts can appear on both iOS and Android devices, not just iPhones.How to make sure tracking alerts are enabled on your iPhoneIf you use an iPhone or iPad, tracking notifications are on by default, but it’s worth confirming your settings.To receive unwanted tracking alerts, make sure that:Your device is running iOS 17.5 or later (or iPadOS 17.5 or later). Earlier versions back to iOS 14.5 support basic AirTag alerts, but newer versions add broader compatibility with other trackers.Bluetooth is turned on.Location Services are enabled.Notifications for Tracking Alerts are allowed.Airplane Mode is turned off.You can check these by opening Settings, then navigating to Privacy & Security, Location Services and Notifications. Apple also recommends turning on Significant Locations in the System Services menu, which helps your device determine when an unknown tracker has traveled with you to places like your home.Go to Settings, tap Privacy & Security, then select Location Services.Toggle Location Services on.Scroll down and tap System Services, then toggle Significant Locations on.If these settings are disabled, your iPhone may not be able to alert you when an AirTag or similar device is nearby.What tracking alerts look likeIf your iPhone detects a tracker that doesn’t belong to you moving with you, you may see a notification such as:AirTag Found Moving With YouAirPods Detected“Product Name” Found Moving With YouUnknown Accessory DetectedTapping the alert opens the Find My app, which shows a map of where the item was detected near you. The map uses dots to indicate locations where your device noticed the tracker nearby. This doesn’t mean the owner was actively watching your location at those times, only that the tracker was detected in close proximity.In some cases, the alert may have an innocent explanation. For example, you might be borrowing someone else’s keys, bag or AirPods. If the item belongs to someone in your Family Sharing group, you can temporarily pause alerts for that item by tapping the notification and opting to turn off alerts for that item either for one day or indefinitely. What to do if you hear an AirTag making a soundIf an AirTag or compatible tracker has been separated from its owner for a period of time and is moved, it may emit a sound on its own. This is another built-in safety feature meant to draw attention to the device.If you hear an unfamiliar chirping or beeping sound, especially from a bag, jacket pocket or vehicle, it’s worth checking your belongings to see if there’s an AirTag or similar tracker inside.How to find an unknown AirTag or trackerIf you receive an alert and believe the tracker is still with you, the Find My app offers tools to help locate it.From the alert, you can choose to play a sound on the device to help pinpoint where it’s hidden. Tap the alert.Tap Continue and then tap Play Sound.Listen for the sound or play it again to give yourself more time to find the item.If the tracker is an AirTag and you have a compatible iPhone with ultra wideband connectivity, you may also see a Find Nearby option, which uses Precision Finding to guide you toward it with distance and direction indicators.Tap the alert.Tap Continue and then tap Find Nearby.Follow the onscreen instructions. You may need to move around the space until your iPhone connects to the unknown AirTag.Your iPhone will display the distance and direction of the unknown AirTag, so you can use that information to identify where the unknown AirTag is. When the AirTag is within Bluetooth range of your iPhone, you can tap the Play Sound button to listen for it. You can also tap the Turn Flashlight On button to provide more light if it’s needed.If neither option is available, or if the tracker can’t be located electronically, manually check your belongings. Look through bags, pockets, jackets and vehicles. If you feel unsafe and can’t find the device, Apple recommends going to a safe public place and contacting local law enforcement.The new Apple AirTag that works with Find My app.AppleHow to get information about an AirTagIf you find an unknown AirTag, you can learn more about it without needing to unlock it or log in.Hold the top of your iPhone, or any NFC-capable smartphone, near the white side of the AirTag. A notification should appear.Tap the notification to open a webpage with details about the AirTag. This page includes the serial number and the last four digits of the phone number associated with the owner’s Apple Account.If the AirTag was marked as lost, the page may also include a message from the owner explaining how to contact them. This can help determine whether the situation is accidental or intentional.How to disable an AirTag that isn’t yoursIf you confirm that an AirTag is tracking you and it doesn’t belong to you, you can disable it so it stops sharing its location.From the Find My alert or information page, select Instructions to Disable and follow the steps provided. For an AirTag, this usually involves removing the battery, which immediately stops location updates. Disabling Bluetooth or turning off Location Services on your phone does not stop the AirTag from reporting its location. The device itself must be disabled.If you believe the tracker was used for malicious purposes, keep the AirTag and document its details before contacting law enforcement. Apple states that it can provide information to authorities when legally required.What Android users should knowAndroid devices running Android 6.0 or later can also receive alerts if a compatible Bluetooth tracker, including an AirTag, appears to be moving with you. These alerts are enabled automatically on supported versions of Android.Android users can also manually scan for unknown trackers at any time. Additionally, Apple offers a free Tracker Detect app on the Google Play Store. The app allows Android users to scan for AirTags and Find My network accessories within Bluetooth range that are separated from their owner. If Tracker Detect finds a nearby AirTag that’s been with you for at least 10 minutes, you can play a sound to help locate it.Wrap-upWhile no system is perfect, Apple has built multiple layers of protection into AirTag and the Find My network to reduce the risk of unwanted tracking. With alerts, audible warnings and cross-platform detection on both iOS and Android, most people will be notified if a tracker they don’t own is moving with them. Knowing what these alerts look like and how to respond can help you stay informed, avoid unnecessary panic and take appropriate action if something feels off.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-know-if-an-airtag-is-tracking-you-130000764.html?src=rss",

As a reminder, the latest edition of Steam Next Fest runs from February 23 until March 2, during which you'll be able to check out demos for hundreds of upcoming games. A bunch are available already, including one for Denshattack!, which I definitely recommend checking out. As it turns out, doing Tony Hawk Pro Skater-style tricks with a high-speed Japanese train absolutely rips.On Thursday, there were four showcases highlighting indie games all in a single day. It's not exactly feasible for me to recap them in full here, unfortunately, but I can at least tell you about a few of the many highlights.The Black History Month edition of the Black Voices in Gaming Showcase includes trailers and interviews for some games that are already available, such as Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator, Aerial_Knight's DropShot and Relooted. Of course, the stream featured plenty of games that are on the way too.Erased, from solo developer Jerron Jacques, looks pretty interesting. It's an open-world fighting game that takes place in a cyberpunk setting with dance battles, parkour, pets, strange creatures and much more. Jacques, who has been documenting the game's development process on social media, even carried out some of the parkour motion capture work personally.There was lots of good stuff in this week's Convergence Showcase too, including another peek at Mouse: P.I. for Hire as we get to see one of the game's bosses for the first time. This first-person shooter with rubber-hose animation is set to arrive on March 19.There were other welcome announcements for me in this showcase. First, there was a release date for the Zelda-inspired adventure Gecko Gods. I've had this on my wishlist since 2022, so I'm glad to learn it'll hit Nintendo Switch, PS5 and PC on April 16. In addition, record shop sim Wax Heads (which probably should have been called Low Fidelity, tbh) is coming to PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Nintendo Switch on May 5. You can check out a Steam Next Fest demo for that one now.The second edition of Indie Fan Fest had a trove of goodies as well. For one thing, Balatro publisher Playstack could be about to cause another mass reduction in collective productivity with Raccoin, which now has a release date of March 31. This is another roguelike deckbuilder, but this time it's in the form of a coin pusher. I didn't have a chance to check out the previous playtest to get a better sense of why there's so much buzz around this one, but I'll for sure be trying the Steam Next Fest demo, which is available now.It remains deeply weird to refer to a game under Acclaim's umbrella as an indie, but that's where we are now. The publisher is bringing Ridiculous Games' GridBeat to Nintendo Switch and Steam on March 26. This is a rhythm-based dungeon crawler in which you (a hacker) try to escape from a corporate network after pilfering valuable data. There's a Next Fest demo available for this one too. Meanwhile, a narrower release window for Japanese convenience store sim InKonbini: One Store. Many Stories was revealed. It's coming to Steam, PS5, Nintendo Switch and Xbox in April.Alongside a related sale on Steam, the first Quebec Games Celebration Showcase took place on Thursday. It's always neat to learn about games being made in my neck of the woods.One of those is Surfpunk, a co-op action RPG that looks a bit like Hades with surfing. Radical. You'll venture to procedurally generated islands in search of loot. There are four weapon classes to choose from and gadgets you can craft after collecting resources on your run. There's an updated Steam demo that's said to have around five hours of gameplay. Surfpunk (which is from Convergence: A League of Legends Story developer Double Stallion) will arrive later this year.I'm including this demo announcement trailer for Croak, a precision platformer from Woodrunner Games that appears to be heavily inspired by the likes of Celeste, separately for one main reason. You have to check out the studio's head of \"barketing.\" (Okay okay, the game's hand-drawn visuals look lovely too.)There's plenty of other interesting stuff in the Quebec Games Celebration Showcase, including another look at Tears of Metal from Paper Cult Games, the studio behind the very enjoyable Bloodroots. There's a Steam demo available for the hack-and-slash roguelite, which should be out this spring. Gothic sci-fi Metroidvania Silent Planet looks quite tasty too.New releasesUnder The Island looks and sounds very The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past-coded. But since that's my favorite game of all time, I am not complaining. I love that protagonist Nia appears to use a hockey stick as a weapon too. This action PRG from Slime King Games (and co-publishers Top Hat Studios and Doyoyo Games) has debuted to strong early reviews. It's available now on Steam, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5 and Nintendo Switch for $20, though there's a 15 percent launch sale (you'll need to be a PS Plus member to get the discount on PS4 and PS5).Demon Tides — a 3D, open-world platformer from Bubsy 4D and Demon Turf developer Fabraz — has lots of movement mechanics, including paragliders and hookshots. You can shapeshift into different forms as well.You can create and share graffiti, and this will appear in other players' games (which is a neat touch). Demon Tides is out now on Steam. It'll usually cost $25, but until March 5, you can snap it up for $20.Skate Bums is a 2D skateboarding game in the tradition of the OlliOlli series. As novice skateboarder Lux, you'll try to take down the Skate Bums, a gang of bullies. There are \"weird characters,\" sick combos to pull off, coins to collect and wrecking balls to dodge. There's said to be a \"simple directional trick system\" while each run is apparently short. That seems ideal for quick, pick-up-and-play sessions on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. I also just really like the title. Skate Bums, which is from Lucky Last Studio, will normally cost $15 but there's a 15 percent discount until February 27.Love Eternal is a psychological \"horror platformer about escaping the domain of a selfish god,\" which is a strong pitch from developer brlka and Demonschool publisher Ysbryd Games. You'll need to flip between different gravitational pulls as you navigate this precision platformer, which follows teenager Maya on her attempt to return to her own reality. During a dinner at home, Maya's family disappears and she suddenly appears in an \"eerie, desolate realm\" that looks like an Iron Age castle. That's a creepy enough set up to match the game's haunting atmosphere. Love Eternal is out now on Steam, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch for $10. There's a 15 percent launch discount (again, you'll need to be a PS Plus member to take advantage of that on PlayStation).Upcoming Woe Industries, the developer of You Have Billions Invested In Generative AI (and a bunch of other neat projects), has something intriguing on deck for next week — a standardized gaming test. You can start the Adventure Game Aptitude Test (AGAT) at any time between 1PM and 2PM ET on February 28. You'll have four hours to complete an '80s adventure game of Woe Industries’ choosing. The developer will seemingly be monitoring your browser and smartphone activity to ensure you don't consult a walkthrough. If you're successful, you'll receive an AGAT certification and diploma. Good luck!\"Musical narrative adventure\" People of Note is coming to Steam, Epic Games Store, the Xbox App on PC, Nintendo Switch 2, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S on April 7 for $25 (though there'll be a 10 percent launch discount). The game follows pop singer Cadence on her quest for stardom. Along the way, Cadence and her buds will have to overcome enemies in battles that have turn-based and rhythm-based elements.I mostly enjoyed playing through a preview several months ago, though I had to grit my teeth through the turn-based combat, which is not something I enjoy as a rule. However, Iridium Studios will allow players to turn off elements like that and environmental puzzles so more people who might have otherwise been turned off can enjoy People of Note. You can sample the game now on Steam via a 90-minute Next Fest demo.I don't fully understand what's going on in the reveal trailer for Titanium Court, which is from AP Thomson (a solo developer who previously worked on Consume Me) and publisher Fellow Traveller. Even the press release notes that it's \"impossibly difficult to describe.\" But it has an absorbing trailer soundtracked by an odd, Bill Callahan-esque song and it has already picked up several IGF award nominations, so I'm intrigued.What I am able to surmise is that it's a surrealist, roguelike strategy game with match-three, auto battle and tower defense elements. It's also for \"clowns and criminals,\" apparently. I'm gonna have to give the Steam Next Fest demo a shot to try to get my head around it. Titanium Court is coming to Steam “imminently.”Sometimes, a game pops up that makes me think \"how has no one done this before?\" Such is the case with Become. It's a third-person linear adventure from solo developer Valentin Wirth in which you take on the guise of a single sperm. You can probably guess what the goal is.The game has \"no explicit sexual acts, nudity or violence,\" according to its Steam page, though you will encounter some danger along your journey. You can upgrade your bespectacled spermatozoon via skill trees and seemingly adorn various pieces of headgear. Become is slated to hit Steam later this year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/an-old-school-zelda-like-skate-bums-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-120000770.html?src=rss",

As a reminder, the latest edition of Steam Next Fest runs from February 23 until March 2, during which you'll be able to check out demos for hundreds of upcoming games.

The new study analyzed a plume of pollution trailing part of a Falcon rocket that crashed through the upper atmosphere on Feb. 19, 2025, after SpaceX lost control of its reentry. The rocket was launched earlier that month, carrying 20 to 22 Starlink satellites into orbit.

          "content": "When dinosaur fossils surface at a site, it is often not possible to tell how many millions of years ago their bones were buried. While the different strata of sedimentary rock represent periods of geologic history frozen in time, accurately dating them or the fossils trapped within them has frequently proven to be frustrating. Fossilized bones and teeth have been dated with some success before, but that success is inconsistent and depends on the specimens. Both fossilization and the process of sediment turning to rock can alter the bone in ways that interfere with accuracy. While uranium-lead dating is among the most widely used methods for dating materials, it is just an emerging technology when applied to directly dating fossils. Dinosaur eggshells might have finally cracked a way to date surrounding rocks and fossils. Led by paleontologist Ryan Tucker of Stellenbosch University, a team of researchers has devised a method of dating eggshells that reveals how long ago they were covered in what was once sand, mud, or other sediments. That information will give the burial time of any other fossils embedded in the same layer of rock.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Daphne O. Martschenko and Sam Trejo both want to make the world a better, fairer, more equitable place. But they disagree on whether studying social genomics—elucidating any potential genetic contributions to behaviors ranging from mental illnesses to educational attainment to political affiliation—can help achieve this goal. Martschenko’s argument is largely that genetic research and data have almost always been used thus far as a justification to further entrench extant social inequalities. But we know the solutions to many of the injustices in our world—trying to lift people out of poverty, for example—and we certainly don’t need more genetic research to implement them. Trejo’s point is largely that more information is generally better than less. We can’t foresee the benefits that could come from basic research, and this research is happening anyway, whether we like it or not, so we may as well try to harness it as best we can toward good and not ill. Obviously, they’re both right. In What We Inherit: How New Technologies and Old Myths Are Shaping Our Genomic Future, we get to see how their collaboration can shed light on our rapidly advancing genetic capabilities.Read full article Comments",

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) helps determine the frameworks underpinning everything from cybersecurity to semiconductor manufacturing. Some of NIST’s recent work includes establishing guidelines for securing AI systems and identifying health concerns with air purifiers and firefighting gloves. Many of the agency’s thousands of employees, postdoctoral scientists, contractors, and guest researchers are brought in from around the world for their specialized expertise. “For weeks now, rumors of draconian new measures have been spreading like wildfire, while my staff’s inquiries to NIST have gone unanswered,” Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, wrote in a letter sent to acting NIST Director Craig Burkhardt on Thursday. April McClain Delaney, a fellow Democrat on the committee, cosigned the message.Read full article Comments",

Unlike the first attempt to load propellants into the SLS rocket on February 2, there were no major leaks during Thursday's practice countdown at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Technicians swapped seals at the launch pad after hydrogen gas leaked from the rocket's main fueling line earlier this month. This time, the seals held. \"For the most part, those fixes all performed pretty well yesterday,\" said Lori Glaze, acting associate administrator for NASA's exploration programs. \"We were able to fully fuel the SLS rocket within the planned timeline.\"Read full article Comments",
