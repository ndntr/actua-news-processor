          "content": "The Trump administration’s heightened monitoring of immigrants’ social media accounts seeking grounds to revoke their visas stifles the speech rights of both noncitizens and citizens alike, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) alleges in a new lawsuit. The lawsuit seeks to end the State Department’s “Catch-and-Revoke” policy, which threatens to strip visaholders of their legal status to stay in the US should the government’s AI-assisted reviews of social media accounts turn up what the administration determines to be support for Hamas or other designated terror organizations. What counts toward that definition might be fairly broad, given that President Donald Trump recently labeled Antifa a domestic terrorist organization in an executive order. The EFF filed the lawsuit on behalf of labor unions including the United Automobile Workers, Communications Workers of America, and American Federation of Teachers, whose members include immigrants who could be subject to the visa revocation program. It claims that the policy effectively chills speech by encouraging individuals to self-censor to avoid being booted from the country. “Many of Plaintiffs’ members no longer express views remotely related to the topics the government disfavors, especially online where the government is watching,” the complaint says. Some members have also limited their engagement with the unions themselves, it says, fearing retribution for public union activity. That chilling effect can extend to US citizens in some circumstances, EFF senior staff attorney Sophia Cope says, like if they’re in a relationship with a visaholder who they fear could be punished for their own remarks online. “We are not going to be importing activists into the United States” Secretary of State Marco Rubio asserted in March that the US has the ability to revoke visas for many reasons, just like they can decide whether to grant them. He told reporters the agency wasn’t going after people “complaining about paper straws,” but insisted it has the right to deny visas for students whose activities are “supportive of movements that run counter to the foreign policy of the United States,” a category that’s included pro-Palestinian protest. “We are not going to be importing activists into the United States,” he said, based on a transcript released by the State Department. “They’re here to study. They’re here to go to class. They’re not here to lead activist movements that are disruptive and undermine the – our universities. I think it’s lunacy to continue to allow that.” Rubio called visas “a gift” and added that “no one is entitled to a visa.” This rationale already raised serious First Amendment concerns for groups like EFF, but recently, the visa revocation standards have become even broader. On Tuesday, the State Department shared that it had revoked visas for immigrants who posted negative comments about right-wing activist Charlie Kirk after he was killed at a public event, continuing a wave of speech crackdowns by conservatives. The complaint includes the X thread the State Department posted about the revocations, calling it “an extraordinary admission of what the administration is doing.” Cope says constitutional protections apply to people in the US regardless of citizenship status. “Our argument is that if you are here, just like you&#8217;re subject to due process under the Fifth Amendment, you are subject to First Amendment protections under the First Amendment,” she says. “If we’re a country that values free speech, ​​then we should value it for everyone who&#8217;s here,” Cope says. “Otherwise, it doesn&#8217;t really mean very much.”",

In a Thursday post, members of the Google Threat Intelligence Group said the technique provides the hackers with their own “bulletproof” host, a term that describes cloud platforms that are largely immune from takedowns by law enforcement and pressure from security researchers. More traditionally, these hosts are located in countries without treaties agreeing to enforce criminal laws from the US and other nations. These services often charge hefty sums and cater to criminals spreading malware or peddling child sexual abuse material and wares sold in crime-based flea markets. Next-gen, DIY hosting that can’t be tampered with Since February, Google researchers have observed two groups turning to a newer technique to infect targets with credential stealers and other forms of malware. The method, known as EtherHiding, embeds the malware in smart contracts, which are essentially apps that reside on blockchains for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Two or more parties then enter into an agreement spelled out in the contract. When certain conditions are met, the apps enforce the contract terms in a way that, at least theoretically, is immutable and independent of any central authority.Read full article Comments",

According to Microsoft’s Consumer Chief Marketing Officer Yusuf Mehdi, “AI PCs” should be able to recognize input “naturally, in text or voice,” to be able to guide users based on what’s on their screens at any given moment, and that AI assistants “should be able to take action on your behalf.”Read full article Comments",

OnePlus was slower than most smartphone makers to embrace AI, but it’s full-steam ahead now with new Gemini integrations. OxygenOS 16 is described by OnePlus in grandiose terms as “a defiant rebellion for authenticity.” In the real world, this update is doing a lot of the same things as other AI-heavy smartphones. It’s not all AI—OnePlus notes that OxygenOS 16 will include revamped animations that have been carefully designed for smoothness, as well as the O+ remote app that gives you remote access to Windows and Mac PCs. The lock screen is also more customizable, borrowing a page from the likes of Apple and Samsung. OnePlus began embracing AI in June, when it launched a feature called Mind Space on the OnePlus 13S. That phone was only for the Indian market, but the rest of the world will get this and more with OxygenOS 16. At launch, Mind Space would collect your screenshots and brief voice messages. Mind Space would analyze the screenshots to create calendar entries and not much else.Read full article Comments",

Sony and the other labels filed their brief in Cox Communications v. Sony Music Entertainment, a case involving the cable Internet service provider that rebuffed labels’ demands for mass terminations of broadband subscribers accused of repeat copyright infringement. The Supreme Court’s eventual decision in the case may determine whether Internet service providers must terminate the accounts of alleged pirates in order to avoid massive financial liability. Cox has argued that copyright-infringement notices—which are generated by bots and flag users based on their IP addresses—sent by record labels are unreliable. Cox said ISPs can’t verify whether the notices are accurate and that terminating an account would punish every user in a household where only one person may have illegally downloaded copyrighted files.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "If you’ve even idly checked in on the robust world of Doom fan development in recent years, you’ve probably encountered one of the hundreds of gameplay mods, WAD files, or entire commercial games based on GZDoom. The open source Doom port—which can trace its lineage back to the original launch of ZDoom back in 1998—adds modern graphics rendering, quality-of-life additions, and incredibly deep modding features to the original Doom source code that John Carmack released in 1997. Now, though, the community behind GZDoom is publicly fracturing, with a large contingent of developers uniting behind a new fork called UZDoom. The move is in apparent protest of the leadership of GZDoom creator and maintainer Cristoph Oelckers (aka Graf Zahl), who recently admitted to inserting untested AI-generated code into the GZDoom codebase. “Due to some disagreements—some recent; some tolerated for close to 2 decades—with how collaboration should work, we’ve decided that the best course of action was to fork the project,” developer Nash Muhandes wrote on the DoomWorld forums Wednesday. “I don’t want to see the GZDoom legacy die, as do most all of us, hence why I think the best thing to do is to continue development through a fork, while introducing a different development model that highly favors transparent collaboration between multiple people.”Read full article Comments",

Seeking a “wide variety of documents”—including a sweeping request for all communications regarding Musk and all information on nonprofits’ funders and donations—OpenAI claimed that the subpoenas are intended to probe if Musk was involved in the actions or paid nonprofits to make critical comments, NBC News wrote in a report exhaustively documenting the controversy.

The new model is available now to all Claude app, web, and API users. If the benchmarks for Haiku 4.5 reported by Anthropic hold up to independent testing, the fact that the company can match some capabilities of its cutting-edge coding model from only five months ago (and GPT-5 in coding) while providing a dramatic speed increase and cost cut is notable. As a recap, Anthropic ships the Claude family in three model sizes: Haiku (small), Sonnet (medium), and Opus (large). The larger models are based on larger neural networks and typically include deeper contextual knowledge but are slower and more expensive to run. Due to a technique called distillation, companies like Anthropic have been able to craft smaller AI models that match the capability of larger, older models at functional tasks like coding, although it typically comes at the cost of omitting stored knowledge.Read full article Comments",

But not anymore. Physics is physics. As the planet heats up, more ice will melt at both poles, and recent research shows that Antarctica’s ice caps, glaciers, and floating ice shelves, as well as its sea ice, are just as vulnerable to warming as the Arctic. Both satellite data and field observations in Antarctica reveal alarming signs of a Greenland-like meltdown, with increased surface melting of the ice fields, faster-moving glaciers, and dwindling sea ice. Some scientists are sounding the alarm, warning that the rapid “Greenlandification” of Antarctica will have serious consequences, including an accelerated rise in sea levels and significant shifts in rainfall and drought patterns.Read full article Comments",

In interviews, company officials said that if NASA wanted to buy Orion missions as a “service,” rather than owning and operating the spacecraft, they were ready to work with the space agency.Read full article Comments",

F5, a Seattle-based maker of networking software, disclosed the breach on Wednesday. F5 said a “sophisticated” threat group working for an undisclosed nation-state government had surreptitiously and persistently dwelled in its network over a “long-term.” Security researchers who have responded to similar intrusions in the past took the language to mean the hackers were inside the F5 network for years. Unprecedented During that time, F5 said, the hackers took control of the network segment the company uses to create and distribute updates for BIG IP, a line of server appliances that F5 says is used by 48 of the world’s top 50 corporations. Wednesday’s disclosure went on to say the threat group downloaded proprietary BIG-IP source code information about vulnerabilities that had been privately discovered but not yet patched. The hackers also obtained configuration settings that some customers used inside their networks.Read full article Comments",

In a normal federal layoff—called a reduction in force, or RIF—the agency would be given a full outline of the roles and branches or divisions affected, as well as some explanation for the cuts, such as alleged fraud, abuse, or redundancy.

The new law taking effect on January 1 says landlords must let tenants “opt out of paying for any subscription from a third-party Internet service provider, such as through a bulk-billing arrangement, to provide service for wired Internet, cellular, or satellite service that is offered in connection with the tenancy.” It was approved by the state Assembly in a 75–0 vote in April, and by the Senate in a 30–7 vote last month. “This is kind of like a first step in trying to give this industry an opportunity to just treat people fairly,” Assemblymember Rhodesia Ransom, a Democratic lawmaker who authored the bill, told Ars last month. “It’s not super restrictive. We are not banning bulk billing. We’re not even limiting how much money the people can make. What we’re saying here with this bill is that if a tenant wants to opt out of the arrangement, they should be allowed to opt out.”Read full article Comments",
