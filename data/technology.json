First, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is reportedly pressuring Anthropic to yield its AI safeguards and give the military unrestrained access to its Claude AI chatbot. The company then chose the same day that the Hegseth news broke to drop its centerpiece safety pledge.On Tuesday, Anthropic said it was modifying its Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP) to lower safety guardrails. Up until now, the company's core pledge has been to stop training new AI models unless specific safety guidelines can be guaranteed in advance. This policy, which set hard tripwires to halt development, was a big part of Anthropic's pitch to businesses and consumers.“Two and a half years later, our honest assessment is that some parts of this theory of change have played out as we hoped, but others have not,” Anthropic wrote. Now, its updated policy approaches safety relatively, rather than with strict red lines.Anthropic's quotes in an interview with Time sound reasonable enough in a vacuum. \"We felt that it wouldn't actually help anyone for us to stop training AI models,\" Jared Kaplan, Anthropic's chief science officer, told Time. \"We didn't really feel, with the rapid advance of AI, that it made sense for us to make unilateral commitments… if competitors are blazing ahead.\"Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei (Photo by David Dee Delgado/Getty Images for The New York Times)David Dee Delgado via Getty ImagesBut you could also read those quotes as the latest example of a hot startup’s ethics becoming grayer as its valuation rises. (Remember Google’s old “Don’t be evil” mantra that it later removed from its code of conduct?) The latest versions of Claude have drawn widespread praise, especially in coding. In February, Anthropic raised $30 billion in new investments. It now has a valuation of $380 billion.

The company has reportedly offered to adopt its usage policies for the Pentagon. However, it wouldn't allow its model to be used for the mass surveillance of Americans or weapons that fire without human involvement.If Anthropic doesn't relent, experts say its best bet would be legal action. But will the Pentagon's proposed penalties be enough to scare a profit-driven startup into compliance? Hegseths' threats reportedly include invoking the Defense Production Act, which gives the president authority to direct private companies prioritize certain contracts in the name of national defense. The military could also sever its contract with Anthropic and designate it as a supply chain risk. That would force other companies working with the Pentagon to certify that Claude isn't included in their workflows.Claude is the only AI model currently used for the military's most sensitive work. \"The only reason we're still talking to these people is we need them and we need them now,” a defense official told Axios. “The problem for these guys is they are that good.\" Claude was reportedly used in the Maduro raid in Venezuela, a topic Amodei is said to have raised with its partner Palantir.Time's story about the new RSP included reactions from a nonprofit director focused on AI risks.

          "title": "Samsung Galaxy S26 vs. Galaxy S25: What’s changed and which one should you buy?",
          "standfirst": "Following Samsung’s Unpacked event, the Samsung Galaxy S26 is available for pre-order, and it looks very familiar. That is not necessarily a bad thing. Like recent updates in the Galaxy S line, Samsung is refining its flagship rather than dramatically reinventing it. Both phones share a lot of core DNA, including compact designs, high-refresh AMOLED displays and similar camera hardware. The S26 does introduce a handful of meaningful updates, however, including a slightly larger battery and newer software out of the box. Those changes also come with a higher starting price: the Galaxy S26 begins at $899.99 compared to the S25’s $799.99 launch price. The entry model now includes 256GB of storage instead of the S25’s base 128GB. Here's how the Galaxy S26 compares with last year’s Galaxy S25 on paper and whether the newer model is worth your attention. Galaxy S26 vs. Galaxy S25: Design, display and performance Physically, the Galaxy S26 stays very close to the design Samsung established with the S25. You still get a compact handset with flat edges, an aluminum frame and IP68 water and dust resistance. The overall look and feel should be immediately familiar to anyone who used last year’s phone. The display story is similarly steady. Both phones use Samsung’s Dynamic AMOLED 2X panels with adaptive refresh rates up to 120Hz, and the S25 is rated for peak brightness of up to 2,600 nits. In everyday use, whether you are scrolling, gaming or watching video, the viewing experience should feel broadly similar between the two devices. Under the hood, the Galaxy S25 is powered globally by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset paired with 12GB of RAM. The Galaxy S26 continues to target flagship-class performance. While Samsung has made internal refinements, overall speed should remain firmly in high-end territory for routine tasks, multitasking and mobile gaming. On the software front, the S25 launched with Android 15 and One UI 7, while the Galaxy S26 ships with a newer version of Samsung’s software out of the box. As usual, the older model is expected to receive updates over time, which may narrow the long-term software gap. Galaxy S26 vs. Galaxy S25: Cameras Samsung has not dramatically reshuffled the base Galaxy camera hardware. The Galaxy S25 features a triple-camera setup built around a 50-megapixel main sensor, a 12MP ultrawide and a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, along with a 12MP front camera. The Galaxy S26 largely sticks with the same proven approach, which suggests image quality should remain broadly consistent in good lighting. As is often the case with Samsung’s year-to-year updates, any meaningful gains are likely to come from image processing improvements rather than brand-new sensors. For most people, that means the S26 should deliver the punchy, reliable photos Samsung flagships are known for, but Galaxy S25 owners should not expect a dramatic leap in camera hardware. Galaxy S26 vs. Galaxy S25: Battery life and charging Battery capacity is one area where the Galaxy S26 makes a measurable change. The Galaxy S25 uses a 4,000mAh battery, while the Galaxy S26 increases that to 4,300mAh. That modest bump should translate into slightly longer endurance in day-to-day use, though real-world gains will depend on efficiency improvements and individual usage patterns. Charging speeds remain largely unchanged. The Galaxy S25 supports up to 25W wired charging, up to 15W wireless charging and 4.5W reverse wireless charging, and the Galaxy S26 stays in the same general range. Galaxy S26 vs. Galaxy S25: Software and AI This year, Samsung is putting more emphasis on Galaxy AI, even on the base Galaxy S26. While many of the headline features are aimed at the Ultra and Plus models, the standard S26 still picks up several practical upgrades. One of the more useful additions is Document Scan, which uses AI to clean up scans by automatically removing distortions, fingers and creases. It can also bundle multiple images into a single PDF, making it easier to digitize receipts, notes or forms without extra editing. Samsung is also expanding its proactive assistant features. Now Brief becomes more personalized on the S26, surfacing reminders and updates based on your activity throughout the day, while the new Now Nudge system can suggest relevant content at the right moment. For example, if someone asks for photos from a recent trip, the phone can proactively surface matching images from your gallery instead of making you search manually. Search is getting smarter as well. Circle to Search with Google now supports enhanced multi-object recognition, allowing you to identify several items in an image at once. Samsung is also upgrading Bixby into a more conversational assistant, and the S26 supports third-party agents such as Gemini and Perplexity for handling more complex, multi-step tasks through voice commands. Security and privacy features are expanding in the background too. The Galaxy S26 introduces AI-powered Call Screening to summarize unknown callers, along with new Privacy Alerts that warn when apps request sensitive permissions. Samsung is also extending its post-quantum cryptography protections deeper into the system, backed by the company’s Knox security platform and seven years of promised security updates. Galaxy S26 vs. Galaxy S25: How to choose If you already own a Galaxy S25, the Galaxy S26 looks like a fairly iterative update. The core experience, including performance, display quality and camera hardware, remains very similar. The main tangible upgrade is the slightly larger battery, along with newer software out of the box. For most S25 owners, that alone probably is not a compelling reason to upgrade. However, if you are coming from an older Galaxy phone or buying fresh, the Galaxy S26 is the more future-proof pick simply because it starts one generation ahead in Samsung’s update cycle and packs the larger battery. As usual with Samsung’s yearly refreshes, the real decision may come down to pricing and discounts. If the Galaxy S25 sees significant price cuts, it could remain the better value. But at similar prices, the Galaxy S26 is the safer long-term buy.

          "content": "Following Samsung’s Unpacked event, the Samsung Galaxy S26 is available for pre-order, and it looks very familiar. That is not necessarily a bad thing. Like recent updates in the Galaxy S line, Samsung is refining its flagship rather than dramatically reinventing it. Both phones share a lot of core DNA, including compact designs, high-refresh AMOLED displays and similar camera hardware. The S26 does introduce a handful of meaningful updates, however, including a slightly larger battery and newer software out of the box. Those changes also come with a higher starting price: the Galaxy S26 begins at $899.99 compared to the S25’s $799.99 launch price. The entry model now includes 256GB of storage instead of the S25’s base 128GB. Here's how the Galaxy S26 compares with last year’s Galaxy S25 on paper and whether the newer model is worth your attention. Galaxy S26 vs. Galaxy S25: Design, display and performance Physically, the Galaxy S26 stays very close to the design Samsung established with the S25. You still get a compact handset with flat edges, an aluminum frame and IP68 water and dust resistance. The overall look and feel should be immediately familiar to anyone who used last year’s phone. The display story is similarly steady. Both phones use Samsung’s Dynamic AMOLED 2X panels with adaptive refresh rates up to 120Hz, and the S25 is rated for peak brightness of up to 2,600 nits. In everyday use, whether you are scrolling, gaming or watching video, the viewing experience should feel broadly similar between the two devices. Under the hood, the Galaxy S25 is powered globally by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset paired with 12GB of RAM. The Galaxy S26 continues to target flagship-class performance. While Samsung has made internal refinements, overall speed should remain firmly in high-end territory for routine tasks, multitasking and mobile gaming. On the software front, the S25 launched with Android 15 and One UI 7, while the Galaxy S26 ships with a newer version of Samsung’s software out of the box. As usual, the older model is expected to receive updates over time, which may narrow the long-term software gap. Galaxy S26 vs. Galaxy S25: Cameras Samsung has not dramatically reshuffled the base Galaxy camera hardware. The Galaxy S25 features a triple-camera setup built around a 50-megapixel main sensor, a 12MP ultrawide and a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, along with a 12MP front camera. The Galaxy S26 largely sticks with the same proven approach, which suggests image quality should remain broadly consistent in good lighting. As is often the case with Samsung’s year-to-year updates, any meaningful gains are likely to come from image processing improvements rather than brand-new sensors.

          "standfirst": "As we prepare to leave the winter months, Samsung announced another family of Galaxy S flagships for those looking to upgrade. As usual, the company put its best components and features into the Galaxy S26 Ultra, but it also added more to the base S26 and S26+. The company has hit its groove with its smaller (and cheaper) flagships, delivering solid devices with increasingly better cameras, occasionally even offering feature parity with its most expensive smartphone. In 2026, that’s what we’re getting, with the 6.3-inch S26 ($899) and 6.7-inch S26+ ($1,099). Both phones are more expensive than last year, and it’s often a game of spot-the-difference when it comes to showing what’s new. Fortunately, the best parts have been retained, too. Samsung has unified the design style across the entire S26 series, with the same corner ratios, curved edges and other design touches. While I tested both phones, I’ll focus on the S26. Barring screen differences and battery size, they’re identically specced. This year’s S26 color selection has a premium Samsung ‘mood’ to it that I can’t quite explain. Does purple mean Samsung to my brain? Maybe. Cobalt Violet is the particular shade I’m talking about, but there are also blue, black and white colors. Additional silver and pink-gold options will be available as online exclusives. There’s not much else to say about the design: it’s another Galaxy S flagship, and if it ain’t broke… Mat Smith for Engadget Samsung has increased the battery capacity to 4,300 mAh on the S26, while somehow maintaining the same thickness as last year’s S25. However, the S26+ has the same 4,900mAH battery as its predecessor. All S26 devices will launch with 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM, with bigger storage options available. With the S26, Samsung has slightly increased the screen size to 6.3 inches, up from last year's 6.2-inch S25. The S26 comes with a familiar camera trio: a 50-megapixel main sensor, 12MP ultrawide, and 10MP telephoto with up to 3x optical zoom. On paper, that’s identical to last year’s base S25. However, Samsung has improved performance with its ProScaler technology for upscaling images and an MDNIe chip, which the company says provides four times the color precision compared to previous devices. There are software improvements too, with video features being the most tangible upgrade, among more AI-assisted photo editing tools. Super Steady video has been upgraded to a 360-degree horizontal lock. This camera mode uses the S26’s gyroscopes to maintain a consistent horizon even as you rush to chase a pet or family member while recording, or to capture snowboarding buddies. (There’s always a snowboarding example when a company mentions horizontal lock.) It’s nice to see a feature we’re used to finding on gimbals and action cams built into an unashamedly mainstream phone like the S26. Auto Framing is another new feature coming to both 4K and 8K video capture. It uses AI to lock onto subjects and automatically tighten framing to what you want to capture. Even during brief testing, I was intrigued and liked the dramatic punch-in effect as I recorded nearby people. It creates a faux-panning effect as it tracks moving subjects, something you might have experienced with Center Stage on Apple devices. Samsung has also upgraded image processing on its front-facing cameras with a new Object Aware Engine for improved portrait mode shots, hair textures and more accurate skin tones. Based on my early testing, images seemed sharper than on my older Samsung devices, even though this is (again) largely the same 12MP camera as last year. With processors, it's getting a little more complicated. In the US, Samsung's entire S26 series will use the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy, but in Europe, both the S26 and S26+ will be powered by the company’s own Exynos 2600, apparently the world’s first 2nm chipset. Comparing it to Snapdragon’s top mobile processor, however, will have to wait until review time. With more power for AI functions, Samsung has continued to evolve and expand its AI software, although it seems less of a priority this year. Only one AI feature stood out during my briefing: Audio Eraser. While this launched on the S25, it only worked on audio and video you captured yourself. Now, Samsung expanded it to most major video platforms, including Netflix, Instagram and YouTube, adding the ability to strip out noise and distractions and amplify the volume of voices. It was especially effective with a rowdy replay of an Arsenal football soccer match, and sounded like I was listening to a dedicated commentary channel. Interestingly, unlike many sound editing apps and features, it will work on downloaded videos on those platforms without an internet connection. Elsewhere, Now Nudge will attempt to suggest actions based on what’s happening onscreen, such as sharing contact numbers with someone or suggesting calendar times while dealing with work emails. Samsung’s Now Brief can pull information and notifications from a wider array of apps and sources to deliver in its daily briefings. However, again, that’s hard to assess at this early stage. There are several more quality–of-life software updates, too, like the ability to sift through all those screenshots after they’ve been automatically categorized into sections like barcodes, events and more. If you can’t get enough AI image generation, you can now use Photo Assist to edit your photos using descriptive prompts. Elsewhere, Circle-to-Search now supports multiple, well, circles, if you’re looking to tag and search for multiple objects at once. Mat Smith for Engadget It’s not the most exciting year for Samsung’s smaller flagship phones. While the S26 Ultra can boast a new Privacy Display that’s the first of its kind, the rest of the S26 family have a little too much in common with their predecessors. The new video features seem useful and intuitive, so there’s more to explore there. We’ll have more to say in our full reviews soon. Both the Galaxy S26 and S26+ launch on March 11th and are available to preorder now.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s26-hands-on-launch-date-price-180005654.html?src=rss",
          "content": "As we prepare to leave the winter months, Samsung announced another family of Galaxy S flagships for those looking to upgrade. As usual, the company put its best components and features into the Galaxy S26 Ultra, but it also added more to the base S26 and S26+. The company has hit its groove with its smaller (and cheaper) flagships, delivering solid devices with increasingly better cameras, occasionally even offering feature parity with its most expensive smartphone. In 2026, that’s what we’re getting, with the 6.3-inch S26 ($899) and 6.7-inch S26+ ($1,099). Both phones are more expensive than last year, and it’s often a game of spot-the-difference when it comes to showing what’s new. Fortunately, the best parts have been retained, too. Samsung has unified the design style across the entire S26 series, with the same corner ratios, curved edges and other design touches. While I tested both phones, I’ll focus on the S26. Barring screen differences and battery size, they’re identically specced. This year’s S26 color selection has a premium Samsung ‘mood’ to it that I can’t quite explain. Does purple mean Samsung to my brain? Maybe. Cobalt Violet is the particular shade I’m talking about, but there are also blue, black and white colors. Additional silver and pink-gold options will be available as online exclusives. There’s not much else to say about the design: it’s another Galaxy S flagship, and if it ain’t broke… Mat Smith for Engadget Samsung has increased the battery capacity to 4,300 mAh on the S26, while somehow maintaining the same thickness as last year’s S25. However, the S26+ has the same 4,900mAH battery as its predecessor. All S26 devices will launch with 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM, with bigger storage options available. With the S26, Samsung has slightly increased the screen size to 6.3 inches, up from last year's 6.2-inch S25. The S26 comes with a familiar camera trio: a 50-megapixel main sensor, 12MP ultrawide, and 10MP telephoto with up to 3x optical zoom. On paper, that’s identical to last year’s base S25. However, Samsung has improved performance with its ProScaler technology for upscaling images and an MDNIe chip, which the company says provides four times the color precision compared to previous devices. There are software improvements too, with video features being the most tangible upgrade, among more AI-assisted photo editing tools. Super Steady video has been upgraded to a 360-degree horizontal lock. This camera mode uses the S26’s gyroscopes to maintain a consistent horizon even as you rush to chase a pet or family member while recording, or to capture snowboarding buddies. (There’s always a snowboarding example when a company mentions horizontal lock.) It’s nice to see a feature we’re used to finding on gimbals and action cams built into an unashamedly mainstream phone like the S26.

The S26 Ultra includes a new processor, a new privacy-focused display technology, an improved camera system and like Samsung's other phones, a crop of new AI-powered software features.On first blush, the Galaxy S26 Ultra isn't all that different from the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Samsung is still using a 6.9-inch QHD+ AMOLED screen, with an 120Hz refresh rate and support for an S Pen stylus. The S26 Ultra also features the same flat sides, utter lack of Qi2-compatible magnets and pronounced camera bump. Despite those similarities, the new flagship does have some differences: for one, it's ever so slightly thinner at 0.31-inches than the S25 Ultra was at 0.32-inches. It also comes with an aluminum frame rather than the titanium frame of the previous generation. For stylus fans, the new S Pen has a curved top that lets it better match the curves of the S26 Ultra. Biggest of all, Samsung's new phone includes \"Privacy Display,\" a new technology that lets the phone limit how much of its screen is visible when you're not looking directly at it.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetInside, the Galaxy S26 Ultra uses Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy chip, a modified version of the flagship mobile chip it debuted last year, and either 12 or 16GB of RAM. In terms of storage, the Galaxy S26 Ultra can come with either 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of memory. Regardless of which version you pick, you'll get a 5,000mAh battery with support for Samsung's wired and wireless fast charging, and Wireless PowerShare for topping up accessories like wireless earbuds.The Galaxy S26 Ultra, just like the S25 Ultra before it, includes an array of four cameras on the back and one selfie camera on the front. The phone features a 200MP f/1.4 wide, 50MP f/1.9 ultra-wide, 10MP f/2.4 3x telephoto, 50MP f/2.9 periscope telephoto and 12MP f/2.2 selfie camera. If you were to just look at just the megapixel counts of the phone, they're identical to last year's model. Samsung's major tweaks are to the aperture of both the wide and periscope cameras, which should let them capture more light.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetOf course, plenty of the flashiest parts of Samsung's new smartphone are software features. The improved photo and video performances of the Galaxy S26 Ultra's cameras is partially driven by software tweaks. Samsung is also adopting Perplexity as a second, system-level AI assistant. The AI can be called with a button press or \"Hey Plex,\" powers improvements to Bixby and can act inside Samsung apps. That doesn't mean Gemini isn't still available, though.

          "standfirst": "Samsung isn’t waiting a full year to reveal its latest Galaxy Buds. The company debuted the Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro at its Galaxy S26 Unpacked event where the hot topic was three new phones. When it comes to Samsung’s earbuds, the company has overhauled the shape and design while improving sound quality, active noise cancellation (ANC) and adding new features. As always, the best of what the Galaxy Buds 4 lineup has to offer will be reserved for people with a recent Samsung phone. While the company is keeping its AirPods-esque “blade” design, it retooled that element to ditch the angular shape and the gimmicky lights. It’s now a flat, metal panel and the area that allows for pinch controls has been engraved so that your fingers find it easily. In terms of shape, Samsung says it analyzed data from hundreds of millions of ear data points and ran over 10,000 simulations to improve overall fit with smaller earbuds. The Galaxy Buds 4 remain an open-fit design while the Pro version has a tip that seals off your ears. Like before, the company kept the transparent lids for the charging cases, although this time the earbuds lay flat in those rather than standing up. Inside of the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro, Samsung is using a wider woofer as part of its two-way driver setup for cleaner bass. That configuration’s dedicated tweeter should also deliver natural, rich treble, according to the company. Both Galaxy Buds 4 models support high quality audio up to 24bit/96kHz (from a recent Samsung device) and direct multi-channel 360 audio is available as well. Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro Billy Steele for Engadget Although the Galaxy Buds Pro 4 got the bulk of the ANC upgrades, Samsung says it improved noise-canceling performance for both models. The company promises effective noise blocking for transit sounds — engine noise from buses, trains or planes — in addition to “everyday background noise.” What’s more, both of the Galaxy Buds 4 devices feature ambient sound mode, adaptive EQ and adaptive ANC, with the latter two applying adjustments automatically as needed. The Pro model can also detect the user’s voice and increase ambient sound for conversations — a feature that’s held over from the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. When you stop talking, the earbuds will automatically resume ANC. The Galaxy Buds 4 Pro also has a Siren Detect feature that activates ambient sound so that you can hear safety alerts like alarms or emergency vehicles. The new item that pushes the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro closer to the AirPods Pro 3 is head gestures. Samsung will now let users manage calls and interact with Bixby by nodding or shaking their head side to side. As before, the Galaxy Buds remain a conduit to Bixby, but they’re also a gateway to Gemini and Perplexity — all of which can be accessed hands-free via voice controls. The Galaxy Buds 4 ($180) and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro ($250) are available for pre-order today before hitting shelves on March 11. Both models will be available in black and white, and there’s a pink gold option on the Pro, although that third color is a Samsung online exclusive.

          "title": "Everything announced at Samsung Unpacked: Galaxy S26 lineup and more",
          "standfirst": "Mobile World Congress is right around the corner, but Samsung got out ahead of many rivals that will be showing off new handsets at that event by running the latest edition of Unpacked on Wednesday. The company took the opportunity to reveal the Galaxy S26 lineup, which includes the base S26, the S26+ and the S26 Ultra. We've got some hands-on impressions of all three handsets as well.In addition to those, Samsung announced the Galaxy Buds 4 along with (you guessed it) some AI updates. Here's a look at everything Samsung announced at the latest Unpacked:Galaxy S26 and S26+ Sam Rutherford for EngadgetNew-ish year, new Samsung phones. Let's deal with the out-and-out bad news first. The S26 and S26+ are each $100 more expensive than their predecessors (the RAM shortage isn't exactly helping to keep prices down). They start at $900 and $1,100, respectively, for variants with 256GB of storage. Samsung has tweaked the design a bit this time by rounding the corners to align them more with the S26 Ultra's look. The base model has a slightly larger display than the S25 at 6.3 inches, though the S26+ still has a 6.7-inch screen (albeit with a higher resolution than the S26 can handle). The S26 has a larger battery capacity than the S25 too at 4,300mAh. In North America, China and Japan, Samsung is sticking with Qualcomm chips rather than using its own Exynos 2600. If you pick up an S26 or S26+ in those markets, it will run on the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset.The camera modules are the same as last year, but Samsung is aiming to supercharge them with upgrades elsewhere, such as ProScaler image upscaling and an MDNIe chip that's said to greatly improve color precision. There's also a video stabilization feature that tries to keep the horizon level while you're following a moving person or pet, which sounds useful for action shots. The new Object Aware Engine is said to better render skin tones and hair textures to make your selfies look better. Samsung has reworked some AI features too, such as making Now Brief and Auto Eraser compatible with more apps.Pre-orders for the S26 and S26+ are open today, and they'll be available on March 11. The phones will be available in purple, blue, black, white, silver and rose gold, though the latter two are online exclusives. We've already had a chance to try the Galaxy S26 and S26+, so be sure to check out our hands-on story for our first impressions.Galaxy S26 UltraThe Galaxy S26 Ultra will be available in the same colorways and on the same date as its smaller siblings. It starts at $1,300, so there’s no price increase from the S25 Ultra. Preorders open today.The S26 Ultra has a 6.9-inch AMOLED display with a QHD+ resolution of 3120 x 1440 and a 120Hz refresh rate. That's all well and good, but the display is hiding (that being the key word) what's perhaps the Galaxy S26 Ultra's most interesting feature.The device has a Privacy Display that’s said to be the first of its kind on a smartphone. The idea here is to prevent people around from seeing what’s on the screen from acute angles. There's a small decrease in brightness when Privacy Display is active, and there are lots of customization options. You can set up Privacy Display to activate when you're asked for a password or PIN, or when you get a notification or open certain apps. So if (for instance) you tend to look at your banking apps when you’re on public transit and don’t want other passengers to see how much moolah you have, Privacy Display seems like a very handy feature.Elsewhere, the S26 Ultra runs on the same chipset as its smaller siblings. It comes with 12 or 16GB of RAM and 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of storage. The battery is larger than the ones in the other S26 models, as the Ultra has a 5,000 mAh capacity. There's support for Super Fast Charging 3.0 as well. Alas, Samsung still hasn't seen fit to offer built-in Qi2 charging magnets in the S26 lineup, which seems like a wild oversight in the year 2026.The selfie camera is the same as on the S26 and S26+. The S26 Ultra has 50MP ultrawide and 200MP wide lenses, along with dual 10MP 3x and 50MP 5x telephoto sensors. The resolutions of those cameras are the same as on the S25 Ultra, but the main 200M and 5x telephoto sensors now have wider apertures to let in more light. The S26 Ultra of course has the camera software features (and other AI features) found in the S26 and S26+.We'll have a review of the Galaxy S26 Ultra soon. In the meantime, head on through to our hands-on story for our initial impressions.Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 ProSamsung Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 ProBilly Steele for EngadgetWhile the S26 phones are more iterative updates this year, Samsung has given its Galaxy Buds a proper refresh. It revamped the design and shape of the Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro to do away with the angular look of the stems and remove the lights from them. The earbuds have a \"more refined, computationally designed fit\" too, according to Samsung. The company claims the latest earbuds have smaller earbud heads that allow for a better, more secure fit and a more \"comfortable experience during all-day wear.\" The Galaxy Buds 4 remain in an open-fit format while the Buds Pro 4 have a canal-fit design.The latest earbuds are said to offer improved audio quality and active noise cancellation (ANC), with an ambient sound mode, adaptive EQ and adaptive ANC. On Buds 4 Pro, there's a siren detection feature that enables ambient sound to let you hear things like alarms or emergency vehicle warnings.The Buds 4 Pro have a wide woofer that increases the effective speaker area by nearly 20 percent compared with the previous gen earbuds, Samsung said.

          "content": "Mobile World Congress is right around the corner, but Samsung got out ahead of many rivals that will be showing off new handsets at that event by running the latest edition of Unpacked on Wednesday. The company took the opportunity to reveal the Galaxy S26 lineup, which includes the base S26, the S26+ and the S26 Ultra. We've got some hands-on impressions of all three handsets as well.In addition to those, Samsung announced the Galaxy Buds 4 along with (you guessed it) some AI updates. Here's a look at everything Samsung announced at the latest Unpacked:Galaxy S26 and S26+ Sam Rutherford for EngadgetNew-ish year, new Samsung phones. Let's deal with the out-and-out bad news first. The S26 and S26+ are each $100 more expensive than their predecessors (the RAM shortage isn't exactly helping to keep prices down). They start at $900 and $1,100, respectively, for variants with 256GB of storage. Samsung has tweaked the design a bit this time by rounding the corners to align them more with the S26 Ultra's look. The base model has a slightly larger display than the S25 at 6.3 inches, though the S26+ still has a 6.7-inch screen (albeit with a higher resolution than the S26 can handle). The S26 has a larger battery capacity than the S25 too at 4,300mAh. In North America, China and Japan, Samsung is sticking with Qualcomm chips rather than using its own Exynos 2600. If you pick up an S26 or S26+ in those markets, it will run on the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset.The camera modules are the same as last year, but Samsung is aiming to supercharge them with upgrades elsewhere, such as ProScaler image upscaling and an MDNIe chip that's said to greatly improve color precision. There's also a video stabilization feature that tries to keep the horizon level while you're following a moving person or pet, which sounds useful for action shots. The new Object Aware Engine is said to better render skin tones and hair textures to make your selfies look better. Samsung has reworked some AI features too, such as making Now Brief and Auto Eraser compatible with more apps.Pre-orders for the S26 and S26+ are open today, and they'll be available on March 11. The phones will be available in purple, blue, black, white, silver and rose gold, though the latter two are online exclusives. We've already had a chance to try the Galaxy S26 and S26+, so be sure to check out our hands-on story for our first impressions.Galaxy S26 UltraThe Galaxy S26 Ultra will be available in the same colorways and on the same date as its smaller siblings. It starts at $1,300, so there’s no price increase from the S25 Ultra. Preorders open today.The S26 Ultra has a 6.9-inch AMOLED display with a QHD+ resolution of 3120 x 1440 and a 120Hz refresh rate. That's all well and good, but the display is hiding (that being the key word) what's perhaps the Galaxy S26 Ultra's most interesting feature.The device has a Privacy Display that’s said to be the first of its kind on a smartphone. The idea here is to prevent people around from seeing what’s on the screen from acute angles. There's a small decrease in brightness when Privacy Display is active, and there are lots of customization options. You can set up Privacy Display to activate when you're asked for a password or PIN, or when you get a notification or open certain apps. So if (for instance) you tend to look at your banking apps when you’re on public transit and don’t want other passengers to see how much moolah you have, Privacy Display seems like a very handy feature.Elsewhere, the S26 Ultra runs on the same chipset as its smaller siblings. It comes with 12 or 16GB of RAM and 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of storage. The battery is larger than the ones in the other S26 models, as the Ultra has a 5,000 mAh capacity. There's support for Super Fast Charging 3.0 as well. Alas, Samsung still hasn't seen fit to offer built-in Qi2 charging magnets in the S26 lineup, which seems like a wild oversight in the year 2026.The selfie camera is the same as on the S26 and S26+. The S26 Ultra has 50MP ultrawide and 200MP wide lenses, along with dual 10MP 3x and 50MP 5x telephoto sensors. The resolutions of those cameras are the same as on the S25 Ultra, but the main 200M and 5x telephoto sensors now have wider apertures to let in more light. The S26 Ultra of course has the camera software features (and other AI features) found in the S26 and S26+.We'll have a review of the Galaxy S26 Ultra soon. In the meantime, head on through to our hands-on story for our initial impressions.Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 ProSamsung Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 ProBilly Steele for EngadgetWhile the S26 phones are more iterative updates this year, Samsung has given its Galaxy Buds a proper refresh. It revamped the design and shape of the Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro to do away with the angular look of the stems and remove the lights from them. The earbuds have a \"more refined, computationally designed fit\" too, according to Samsung. The company claims the latest earbuds have smaller earbud heads that allow for a better, more secure fit and a more \"comfortable experience during all-day wear.\" The Galaxy Buds 4 remain in an open-fit format while the Buds Pro 4 have a canal-fit design.The latest earbuds are said to offer improved audio quality and active noise cancellation (ANC), with an ambient sound mode, adaptive EQ and adaptive ANC. On Buds 4 Pro, there's a siren detection feature that enables ambient sound to let you hear things like alarms or emergency vehicle warnings.The Buds 4 Pro have a wide woofer that increases the effective speaker area by nearly 20 percent compared with the previous gen earbuds, Samsung said. They support 24-bit/96kHz audio.If you're using Galaxy Buds 4 or Buds 4 Pro with a Galaxy device, you'll be able to use Bixby, Google Gemini and Perplexity with hands-free voice controls (though the \"hey, Plex\" command for the latter might be a tad confusing for folks who use a certain media server app).

As a reminder, Circle to Search allows you to carry out a Google Search from almost anywhere on your phone. Just tap and hold your device's home button, and then circle the passage or image you want to know more about. With previous iterations of Circle to Search, the tool's underlying AI system was limited to searching against a single object in an image. Now, thanks to Gemini 3, it can scan and identify multiple objects at the same time. Naturally, Google is quick to point out the boon this represents for shopaholics. If you see a fit you like on Instagram, you can circle an entire person and the tool will attempt to find a match for each item they're wearing, including any shoes and accessories. At the same time, Google has made it easier to see how those clothes might look on you by bringing its virtual try on feature directly inside of Circle to Search. The benefits of the new model aren't only limited to shopping queries. Building on a search technique Google debuted with AI Mode, Circle to Search can now also reason through the relationship between different objects in an image. So say you see a photo of a coral reef and want to know how all the different pictured fish live together, Circle to Search will not only be able to identify the different species shown but also explain how they coexist with one another. Google is bringing the new and improved Circle to Search to Galaxy S26 and Pixel 10 phones first before rolling it out to more Android devices soon.

          "standfirst": "Last year, it felt like Samsung relied a bit too much on AI when trying to convince people to upgrade to its flagship phone. And while there’s no shortage of features that utilize machine learning on the new Galaxy S26 Ultra, it feels like Samsung has done a much better job of filling out the rest of the phone’s kit with fresh hardware, faster charging and a more cohesive design. It’s still rather expensive, but its price has stayed flat year-over-year at $1,300, which when combined with everything else makes it a much more attractive package than its predecessor. Design and displaySamsung’s Ultra phones are always going to be somewhat boxy and that’s OK. However, for the Galaxy S26 Ultra, the company’s top-of-the-line handset is getting a slightly curvier appearance thanks to rounder corners. There’s also a very (and I do mean very) small reduction in size that technically makes this version the thinnest and lightest Ultra to date (214 grams and 7.9mm thick). That said, considering the previous model weighed 218 grams and measured 8.2mm, it’s incredibly hard to feel a difference even when you know what you’re looking for. The two biggest changes to the S26 Ultra's exterior design are more rounded corners and an aluminum chassis instead of titanium like we got on the S25U. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetIn reality, the biggest exterior change is that Samsung has ditched the titanium frame from last year’s phone in favor of an Armor Aluminum chassis with Corning Gorilla Armor 2 panels in front and back. Samsung says this new design is meant to make the Ultra fit in better with its less expensive siblings while also making it easier to do things like color match the phone’s body to the rest of the device. Also, for anyone who keeps track of Samsung’s palette, the hero color for the S26 Ultra is a rather fetching shade of purple called cobalt violet, with sky blue, white and black available as well (plus silver shadow and pink gold being Samsung’s online exclusive hues).If you look closely at the top of the phone, you can see where a notification has been blacked out by the S26 Ultra's Privacy Display. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetHowever, my favorite new thing on the S26 Ultra is its Privacy Display. When activated, it functions a lot like HP’s Sure View tech, which prevents people from peeking at your screen from acute angles. It works both when viewed from the side or up and down and has a surprising amount of customization. Not only can you set it to turn on automatically when the phone asks you for a password or PIN, it can also be triggered by specific apps or whenever you receive a notification. But perhaps the most impressive thing is that there’s almost no impact on image quality. When Privacy Display is active, there is a minor reduction in overall brightness, but aside from that, it’s really hard to tell when it’s on (at least from the front). Furthermore, the S26 Ultra’s 6.9-inch AMOLED screen has the same underlying specs as last year, including its 120Hz variable refresh rate and 2,600 nit peak brightness, so there are pretty much no trade-offs for the added functionality. Performance and chargingThe S26 Ultra still comes with an included S-Pen and a built-in storage slot, but it still doesn't have Bluetooth connectivity like on some of Samsung's older models. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetInside, the S26 Ultra features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy chip along with either 12GB or 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. Compared to its predecessor, Samsung claims the NPU’s performance has made the biggest leap with it being 39 percent more powerful year-over-year with respectable increases for its CPU (19 percent faster) and GPU (24 percent faster) as well.As for charging, both wired and wireless speeds have gotten a big boost with the former now rated at up to 60 watts (up from 45 watts) or 25 watts (up from 15) for the latter when using compatible Qi2 pads. Samsung says buyers will even get a three amp cable in the box, so all you need to do to get those peak wired speeds is to hook it up to the right adapter.A small quirk with the S26 Ultra's S-Pen is that because the end of the stylus is curved to match the corner of the phone, if you put it in \"wrong,\" it'll stick out a bit. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetUnfortunately, we’re still not getting a magnetic ring inside the phone, which means if you want to use the S26 Ultra with magnetic accessories, you’ll need to pair the phone with a case that supports that functionality. This is super frustrating because Samsung says this decision was made in part to keep the handset as thin as possible, but when you consider the difference between the S26 Ultra and the S25 Ultra is 0.3mm, that choice feels rather misguided. CamerasOne of my biggest complaints about last year’s S25 Ultra is that the only new hardware was an updated 50MP sensor for its ultra-wide lens, which is the camera I (and probably most people) use the least. Thankfully, it seems Samsung took note of that because while the resolution of its 200MP main cam, 10MP 3x telephoto and 50MP 5X telephoto are the same as before, the S26 Ultra’s main and 5x zoom lenses now have significantly wider apertures (from f/1.7 to f/1.4 and f/3.4 to f/2.9, respectively). This results in as much as 47 percent more light reaching the phone’s primary sensor (or 37 percent for the 5x telephoto), which should result in some major gains in photo quality and low light sensitivity. That said, I wasn’t able to properly test this during my hands-on session, so I’m going to reserve final judgement for a proper review. The S26 Ultra's 200MP main and 50MP 5x zoon lenses feature significantly larger apertures, which should deliver much improved image quality in low light conditions. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetMeanwhile, for video capture, Samsung is adding support for the APV codec at up to 8K/30 fps to the S26 Ultra along with a new horizon lock feature that will keep your footage level no matter how much you rotate the phone. Now I will admit that the latter didn’t impress me much when I first heard about it, but after testing it out and spinning the phone a full 360-degrees while recording a clip, I was shocked when the resulting video showed no hint of being whirled around. Samsung also says the handset’s improved Nightography processing uses AI to recognize noise patterns in low light to improve image quality. But similar to the wider apertures bringing in more light, I’ll believe it when I see it. Finally, there’s a new AI-powered Photo Assist tool that lets you edit or adjust images using natural language prompts. From what I experienced, it’s effective and works as you’d expect. However, with the proliferation of services and devices offering similar functionality over the past year, this feature feels more like Samsung’s attempt to keep up with the Joneses. AI featuresWhen it comes to AI, the S26 Ultra is getting the same batch of new and improved features as the rest of the S26 family. So if you’re big into machine learning, there’s no need to pay extra for this model. Furthermore, many of the updates for 2026 are tweaks or refinements of existing things like the Gallery app, which now uses AI to automatically sort screenshots into eight different categories so they’re easier to find later. There’s also what Samsung is calling Now Nudge, which functions a lot like Google’s Magic Cue. It’s built into the Samsung keyboard and it can do things like suggest relevant photos based on your conversations. One of the S26's most powerful new AI features is Automated App Actions, which allows the phone to do things like book a car ride via Uber while you continue to use other apps in the foreground. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetTo me, the most impressive of the bunch is the S26’s Automated App Actions, which allow you to ask the phone to do slightly more complicated tasks like ordering an Uber to a specific location. After your initial prompt, Gemini can even complete the task in the background while you go back to doomscrolling or watching videos. When it’s done, you’ll get a notification so you can manually review and confirm the command. Unfortunately, Uber will be the only supported app at launch, though Samsung says it’s working on expanding the feature to others like Instacart. Early thoughtsThe Galaxy S26 Ultra will be available in four main colors: sky blue, black, cobalt violet and white, along with two more online exclusive hues in silver shadow and pink gold. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetLook, there’s no getting around it: $1,300 is a lot to spend on a phone. That said, considering the RAM shortage that’s going on right now, keeping the S26 Ultra’s price the same as last year’s phone feels like a small blessing. And when you get that on a handset with a more refined design, a beefier chip, a fancy Privacy Display, faster charging and an updated generation of AI-powered tools, Samsung’s latest flagship feels like a much better deal than its predecessor. Really, the only thing that hasn’t been improved is the Ultra’s S-Pen, which as time goes on, is starting to feel more and more like a consolation prize for people who are still nostalgic about the Note line than a true tentpole feature. Now this doesn’t mean that people with an S25 Ultra or even an S24 Ultra should run out and upgrade. But for anyone with something older than that who’s in the market for a true do-everything phone, the S26 Ultra has quite a bit to offer. Pre-orders for the Galaxy S26 Ultra are live now, with official sales slated for March 11.

Furthermore, many of the updates for 2026 are tweaks or refinements of existing things like the Gallery app, which now uses AI to automatically sort screenshots into eight different categories so they’re easier to find later. There’s also what Samsung is calling Now Nudge, which functions a lot like Google’s Magic Cue. It’s built into the Samsung keyboard and it can do things like suggest relevant photos based on your conversations. One of the S26's most powerful new AI features is Automated App Actions, which allows the phone to do things like book a car ride via Uber while you continue to use other apps in the foreground. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetTo me, the most impressive of the bunch is the S26’s Automated App Actions, which allow you to ask the phone to do slightly more complicated tasks like ordering an Uber to a specific location. After your initial prompt, Gemini can even complete the task in the background while you go back to doomscrolling or watching videos. When it’s done, you’ll get a notification so you can manually review and confirm the command. Unfortunately, Uber will be the only supported app at launch, though Samsung says it’s working on expanding the feature to others like Instacart. Early thoughtsThe Galaxy S26 Ultra will be available in four main colors: sky blue, black, cobalt violet and white, along with two more online exclusive hues in silver shadow and pink gold. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetLook, there’s no getting around it: $1,300 is a lot to spend on a phone. That said, considering the RAM shortage that’s going on right now, keeping the S26 Ultra’s price the same as last year’s phone feels like a small blessing. And when you get that on a handset with a more refined design, a beefier chip, a fancy Privacy Display, faster charging and an updated generation of AI-powered tools, Samsung’s latest flagship feels like a much better deal than its predecessor. Really, the only thing that hasn’t been improved is the Ultra’s S-Pen, which as time goes on, is starting to feel more and more like a consolation prize for people who are still nostalgic about the Note line than a true tentpole feature. Now this doesn’t mean that people with an S25 Ultra or even an S24 Ultra should run out and upgrade. But for anyone with something older than that who’s in the market for a true do-everything phone, the S26 Ultra has quite a bit to offer. Pre-orders for the Galaxy S26 Ultra are live now, with official sales slated for March 11.

          "standfirst": "The wait is over. At its Unpacked event today, Samsung took the wraps off its new S26 family of phones. Unlike the S26 Ultra, the S26 and S26+ represent mostly iterative updates. Samsung has tweaked the design of the two devices, making it so they share the same rounded corners of their more expensive sibling. Additionally, the S26 has a slightly larger 6.3-inch AMOLED display and a higher capacity 4,300mAh battery inside. As for the S26+, it still has a 6.7-inch screen and 4,900mAh battery. Like in years past, Samsung is depending on new and expanded software capabilities rather than updated hardware to give the S26 and S26+'s cameras an edge over the competition. As before, both phones feature a 50-megapixel main camera, a 12MP ultra-wide and a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom. For selfies, they’re equipped a 12MP front-facing camera. The company says its new Object Aware Engine will allow the front-facing cameras to deliver more pleasing portrait mode shots, with better rendering of skin tones and hair textures. For videos, Samsung has updated its Super Steady tech, making it capable of maintaining a 360-degree horizontal lock. The upgraded feature should make it easier to maintain a consistent level horizon while trying to record a video of a moving child or pet. A new feature named Auto Framing uses a machine learning algorithm to automatically tighten the frame while filming 4K and 8K clips. The S26 will be available in six different colorways, with the four pictured here available in store. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetAnd if you're a Snapdragon fan, you can rest easy. While some pre-release reports suggested Samsung was planning to use its new flagship Exynos chipset across the entire S26 line, North American and Japanese variants of the S26 and S26+ will once again ship with Qualcomm silicon instead. Specifically, the two phones come specced with the speedy Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, which debuted alongside the OnePlus 15 in November 2025. It will be interesting to see how the new Exynos 2600 compares with its Snapdragon counterpart; the former is the world's first 2nm chipset. Over on the software front, Samsung has upgraded its suite of AI features. For instance, the company has made Now Brief capable of pulling from a wider variety of apps to generate more comprehensive daily summaries. Similarly, the company's handy Auto Eraser feature now works across streaming services like Netflix, allowing you to make it easier to hear dialogue in a greater variety of videos. The two phones will retail for $899 and $1,099, making them both $100 more expensive than their predecessors. They come standard with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Samsung will also offer 512GB variants, alongside six different colorways of each phone. In-store, you'll find the S26 and S26+ in purple, blue, black and white, with silver and rose gold being online exclusives. Pre-orders open today, with general availability to follow on March 11.

This resulted in the theft of 150GB of official government data, including taxpayer records, employee credentials and more. The hacker used Claude to find vulnerabilities in government networks and to write scripts to exploit them. It also tasked the chatbot with finding ways to automate data theft, as indicated by cybersecurity company Gambit Security. This started in December and continued for around a month.

Anthropic has investigated the claims, disrupted the activity and banned all of the accounts involved, according to a company representative. The spokesperson also said that its latest model, Claude Opus 4.6, includes tools to disrupt this kind of misuse. It's also been reported that this hacker used ChatGPT to supplement the attacks, using OpenAI's chatbot to gather information on how to move through computer networks, determine which credentials were needed to access systems and how to avoid detection. OpenAI says it has identified attempts by the hacker to violate its usage policies and that the tools refused to comply. The hacker remains unidentified. The attacks haven't been attributed to a specific group, but Gambit Security did suggest they could be tied to a foreign government.

          "title": "ASUS ProArt GoPro Edition PX13 review: An incredible if pricy Windows creator laptop",
          "standfirst": "With its ProArt lineup, ASUS has commendably addressed a glaring hole in the PC market by targeting video editors and other creative pros. Its latest model even uses a popular camera marque in its name: the ProArt GoPro Edition PX13. It’s a true co-branding exercise, with GoPro-like styling, a dedicated GoPro hotkey, mil-spec durability for extreme outdoor users and 12 months of GoPro’s Cloud Plus Premium. It has a lot going for it on the inside, too. The AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor offers 16 Zen 5 cores with integrated Radeon 8060S Graphics (40 cores) and AMD Ryzen AI with up to 50 NPU TOPS. It packs a relatively small but pixel-dense 13-inch 2,880 x 1,800 OLED convertible 360 touch display, 1TB of storage and an impressive 128GB of unified memory. The rub, as you might expect with all that RAM, is the price. The ProArt GoPro Edition PX13 costs $3,000, while a version with the same processor but half the memory is $2,800. That’s high-end MacBook Pro money, and while the ProArt is a good PC creator machine, it falls short of its Apple counterpart in terms of performance and usability. Design In place of the ProArt P13’s smooth lines, the ProArt GoPro Edition comes with a ribbed metal back that’s designed to look like the front of a GoPro Hero 13. It also has GoPro-like ridges on the hinge and plastic above the keyboard, along with GoPro and ProArt branding. The rugged design may appeal to the extreme sports crowd, but I’d prefer something a bit sleeker. The laptop is relatively light at 3.06 pounds, but the dedicated 200W power brick adds an extra pound of weight. Despite the small size, it offers MIL-STD 810H military-grade durability, so it can handle hot and humid conditions while surviving 500Hz vibrations and multiple four-inch drops while running. To help keep the laptop safe outside, ASUS includes a protective padded sleeve with a braided pouch to tuck a selfie stick or another accessory. Steve Dent for Engadget The 2,880 x 1,800 OLED touchscreen is nice but not super bright, with up to 400 nits of brightness or 500 nits in HDR mode. That’s the usual tradeoff for OLED compared to super bright MiniLED displays. However, it has deep blacks and very high color accuracy of Delta < 1 with 100 percent DCI-P3 coverage, along with Dolby Vision support, so it’s great for photo and video work or entertainment. The ProArt is a 360-degree convertible model and ships with an ASUS Pen and Pen charger. That makes it a good option for graphic artists who want to tent the screen or fold it around to use in tablet mode for sketching or painting. The ASUS Pen works well, and though it’s not as accurate as Wacom or other dedicated pen devices, it has nice haptic feedback when you perform actions in the app. The ProArt GoPro Edition’s keyboard is excellent, with a nice amount of travel for typing or gaming. The touchpad is also one of the better ones I’ve used on a PC thanks to the quality tactile feel. The top left of the touchpad contains ASUS’s control dial designed for jogging video footage or adjusting colors, but it’s a bit fussy and gimmicky. For ports, you get HDMI, 3.5mm audio, USB-A 3.2 and two USB-C 4.0 with power delivery that allow up to 130 watts of charging. The laptop weirdly comes with a microSD slot to load GoPro footage straight from the camera, but it would be better to have a regular SD port and microSD adapter. As for wireless and audio, it offers Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4 and Dolby Atmos support. Performance Steve Dent for Engadget Built on TSMC’s 4nm line, the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is AMD’s most powerful APU designed to blend performance and low power consumption. It’s married to a Radeon 8060S GPU with 40 compute units (equivalent to an NVIDIA RTX 4060, AMD says) that makes it ideal for creative chores, AI processing and gaming. This unit also comes with 128GB of unified LPDDR5X RAM that’s soldered directly to the motherboard, shared between the CPU and GPU. Given today’s RAM prices, that amount of memory no doubt contributes to the ProArt GoPro Edition’s high price. AMD finally got its act together for video encoding and decoding. The Ryzen AI Max+’s GPU supports most 8- and 10-bit MP4 codecs, including H.264, H.265, VP9 and AV1. That means you can play back nearly all MP4 or Quicktime camera video files in real time, including the 8K H.265 files recorded by a GoPro Hero 13. At the same time, the large number of cores and threads (16 and 32) helps the ProArt GoPro Edition render certain VFX and do color adjustments quickly. The 1TB of NVMe SSD storage is limited to PCIe 4.0, but it’s relatively speedy with 6.55 GB/s read and 5.86 GB/s write speeds — easily fast enough for 8K video playback. All of that made video work a breeze in DaVinci Resolve 20, Adobe Premiere Pro or GoPro’s Player that can be activated by a special hotkey on the ASUS laptop. Actions like color correction work in real time as well, and 4K H.264 exports can also be performed quickly. That said, some functions like OpenFX and stabilization would work better with a more powerful discrete GPU. Also, unlike my MacBook Pro, the ProArt GoPro Edition’s fans need to engage frequently under intense workloads, creating a lot of noise and killing the battery quickly if the unit isn’t plugged in. Steve Dent for Engadget For other apps, including Photoshop, Illustrator and Lightroom Classic, the ASUS ProArt is ideal. It’s very responsive and the touch display and pen support fine masking or drawing work, something you can’t do on a MacBook Pro. The ProArt also handles synthetic benchmarks well for a PC with an integrated GPU. The single/multi Geekbench 6 CPU score of 2,219/19,088 shows the benefit of 16 processor cores. The 93,108 Geekbench 6 GPU mark isn’t that far behind Acer’s NVIDIA RTX 5070-equipped Predator Titan 14 AI. Geekbench AI scores were also up there with the best laptops. However, Handbrake video encoding was slower than several MacBook M4 laptops I’ve tested. For gaming, it had some of the higher laptop scores I’ve seen on several 3DMark tests (Wildlife Extreme and Port Royal Ray Tracing). It also did pretty darn well on Cyberpunk 2077, hitting 82 fps at 1080p and 60 fps at 1440p in Ultra mode. Considering the machine’s small size, those framerates are really good. However, the laptop is held back gaming-wise by the OLED display that tops out at 500 nits and just 60Hz. A big benefit of the 128GB of fast unified memory is that you can run AI models locally for improved privacy. While the ProArt GoPro Edition normally allocates 64GB of memory to the CPU and splits the rest between the CPU and iGPU, you can dedicate up to 96GB of memory to the GPU for extra large AI applications via the MyASUS app. Another plus of this APU is the battery life. The ProArt GoPro Edition lasted a solid 11:31 hours on the PCMark 10 Modern Office battery rundown test, besting all rivals with similar performance. That tells me that AMD is narrowing the performance-per-watt gap with Apple’s silicon to improve gaming and content creation for PCs on battery power alone. Wrap-up Steve Dent for Engadget ASUS is one of the few PC manufacturers trying to compete with Apple in the creator market, and with the ProArt GoPro Edition laptop, it has largely succeeded. This model offers excellent performance and battery life, a huge amount of memory, a very nice OLED HDR display, a nice range of ports and an excellent keyboard and trackpad. It easily handled my typical video and photo editing chores, even on battery power alone, and the included GoPro features like the Storyblocks cloud storage are a nice option for action cam users. The convertible configuration and touchscreen with pen option are also useful to artists and photo editors. However, this laptop is not cheap at $3,000, which is the same price as a high-end 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 Pro. The latter offers superior battery life, better overall performance on apps like DaVinci Resolve and a far better macOS user experience than the hot mess that is currently Windows 11. However, if you want a Windows PC with a touchscreen, I think the ASUS ProArt GoPro Edition laptop is the best creator model you can get right now.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/asus-proart-gopro-edition-px13-review-an-incredible-if-pricy-windows-creator-laptop-170016800.html?src=rss",

That means you can play back nearly all MP4 or Quicktime camera video files in real time, including the 8K H.265 files recorded by a GoPro Hero 13. At the same time, the large number of cores and threads (16 and 32) helps the ProArt GoPro Edition render certain VFX and do color adjustments quickly. The 1TB of NVMe SSD storage is limited to PCIe 4.0, but it’s relatively speedy with 6.55 GB/s read and 5.86 GB/s write speeds — easily fast enough for 8K video playback. All of that made video work a breeze in DaVinci Resolve 20, Adobe Premiere Pro or GoPro’s Player that can be activated by a special hotkey on the ASUS laptop. Actions like color correction work in real time as well, and 4K H.264 exports can also be performed quickly. That said, some functions like OpenFX and stabilization would work better with a more powerful discrete GPU. Also, unlike my MacBook Pro, the ProArt GoPro Edition’s fans need to engage frequently under intense workloads, creating a lot of noise and killing the battery quickly if the unit isn’t plugged in. Steve Dent for Engadget For other apps, including Photoshop, Illustrator and Lightroom Classic, the ASUS ProArt is ideal. It’s very responsive and the touch display and pen support fine masking or drawing work, something you can’t do on a MacBook Pro. The ProArt also handles synthetic benchmarks well for a PC with an integrated GPU. The single/multi Geekbench 6 CPU score of 2,219/19,088 shows the benefit of 16 processor cores. The 93,108 Geekbench 6 GPU mark isn’t that far behind Acer’s NVIDIA RTX 5070-equipped Predator Titan 14 AI. Geekbench AI scores were also up there with the best laptops. However, Handbrake video encoding was slower than several MacBook M4 laptops I’ve tested. For gaming, it had some of the higher laptop scores I’ve seen on several 3DMark tests (Wildlife Extreme and Port Royal Ray Tracing). It also did pretty darn well on Cyberpunk 2077, hitting 82 fps at 1080p and 60 fps at 1440p in Ultra mode. Considering the machine’s small size, those framerates are really good. However, the laptop is held back gaming-wise by the OLED display that tops out at 500 nits and just 60Hz. A big benefit of the 128GB of fast unified memory is that you can run AI models locally for improved privacy. While the ProArt GoPro Edition normally allocates 64GB of memory to the CPU and splits the rest between the CPU and iGPU, you can dedicate up to 96GB of memory to the GPU for extra large AI applications via the MyASUS app. Another plus of this APU is the battery life. The ProArt GoPro Edition lasted a solid 11:31 hours on the PCMark 10 Modern Office battery rundown test, besting all rivals with similar performance. That tells me that AMD is narrowing the performance-per-watt gap with Apple’s silicon to improve gaming and content creation for PCs on battery power alone. Wrap-up Steve Dent for Engadget ASUS is one of the few PC manufacturers trying to compete with Apple in the creator market, and with the ProArt GoPro Edition laptop, it has largely succeeded. This model offers excellent performance and battery life, a huge amount of memory, a very nice OLED HDR display, a nice range of ports and an excellent keyboard and trackpad. It easily handled my typical video and photo editing chores, even on battery power alone, and the included GoPro features like the Storyblocks cloud storage are a nice option for action cam users. The convertible configuration and touchscreen with pen option are also useful to artists and photo editors. However, this laptop is not cheap at $3,000, which is the same price as a high-end 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 Pro. The latter offers superior battery life, better overall performance on apps like DaVinci Resolve and a far better macOS user experience than the hot mess that is currently Windows 11. However, if you want a Windows PC with a touchscreen, I think the ASUS ProArt GoPro Edition laptop is the best creator model you can get right now.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/asus-proart-gopro-edition-px13-review-an-incredible-if-pricy-windows-creator-laptop-170016800.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "For years, the \"last mile\" of digital transformation has been littered with forgotten PDFs and ignored training manuals. Organizations spend millions on sophisticated software like SAP or Salesforce, only for employees to struggle with basic navigation. Now, as the era of agentic AI arrives, companies face a double-edged sword: they must teach human employees to collaborate with AI, while simultaneously teaching AI agents to navigate the labyrinthine interfaces of the modern enterprise. One idea that seems to be gaining momentum among AI-forward businesses: using screen recordings and tutorials/walkthroughs of someone performing an enterprise task — be it creating a new ticket or processing an invoice — and training AI to replicate the flow based on the screen capture. Just this week, a startup called Standard Intelligence went viral on X showing an early demo of open-ended version of this for the physical and digital world.But the truth is, there are already players tackling this problem for the enterprise itself square-on: case-in-point, Guidde, an Israel startup born during the video-centric years of the COVID-19 pandemic, today announced an oversubscribed $50 million Series B funding round led by PSG Equity to address this exact knowledge infrastructure crisis. Instead of feeding an agent a static PDF manual, Guidde provides high-fidelity \"Video Ground Truth\"—a rich stream of data captured from real human experts as they navigate complex software.The investment signals a shift in how the tech industry views documentation—not as a static byproduct of work, but as the critical telemetry needed to train the next generation of autonomous digital agents.Technology: from video capture to world modelsAt its core, Guidde is an AI Digital Adoption Platform (ADAP). However, its technological breakthrough lies in what happens behind the scenes during a recording. Guidde isn&#x27;t just recording pixels; it is capturing every click, scroll, and latent interaction with the HTML page—the subtle pauses, the specific scroll depths, and the corrections a human makes when a system lags. This telemetry transforms raw video into a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) training set. Meanwhile, the platform&#x27;s Magic Redaction automatically obscures sensitive data like passwords or credit card numbers during capture, ensuring materials remain secure and HIPAA-aligned. \"Every time you click a button, you drag-and-drop, you scroll, you type, we gather the interaction... all of it, we do cleanse it—there&#x27;s no private information,\" explained Guidde co-founder and CEO Yoav Einav in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat.Under the hood, the platform captures the underlying metadata and DOM (Document Object Model) changes synchronized with the video frames. The differentiator is the telemetry hidden beneath the surface.This rich metadata creates a \"digital world model\" of enterprise software. And because each enterprise uses its own unique mix of apps and processes, Guidde is creating a data moat that allows enterprise agents to reason through legacy UIs with the same spatial awareness as a human, ensuring that automation actually works in a production environment rather than just a lab demo. For a human, it’s a tutorial. For an AI agent, it is a high-fidelity map of the interface. This allows agents to \"see\" and reason through complex UIs the way humans do, solving the \"last mile\" of automation where agents previously failed due to lack of specific enterprise and in-situ usage context.In a sense, Guidde is building a \"self-driving car\" like a Waymo for computer usage. Product: three pillars of Guidd-anceThe platform has evolved into three distinct products designed to scale with an organization&#x27;s maturity:Guidde Create: The engine for subject matter experts to turn workflows into documentation in minutes.Guidde Broadcast: A personalized recommendation engine—often compared to Netflix—that delivers answers inside the tools people actually use. It knows who the user is and what department they are in to surface relevant content exactly when needed.Guidde Discover: The newly launched \"agentic\" pillar. Like Waze mapping roads by observing drivers, Discover maps software routes by tracking how employees work. It understands the workflow, creates the content, and updates it automatically when the UI changes.Training humans how to use AI — and AI using humansThe most non-obvious aspect of Guidde’s growth is its dual-purpose mission. \"We&#x27;re the only platform that trains both humans and agents,\" Einav stated.As companies roll out AI tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot or ServiceNow agents, they hit a proficiency gap. One of Guidde’s largest customers revealed they were paying over $1 million a year for a sophisticated AI tool, yet \"nobody knows how to use them because they did like a 30-minute training session, and then that’s it.\" Guidde closes this gap by providing \"bite-sized\" video tutorials in the flow of work.Simultaneously, these videos train the AI agents themselves. Foundation models like Gemini or GPT-4 often hallucinate when tasked with specific enterprise workflows because they weren&#x27;t trained on the highly specific, internal \"vanilla workflows\" found in private enterprise systems. Guidde provides the \"starting point,\" the \"metadata,\" and the \"x, y coordinates of the button\" that an agent needs to complete an action without getting stuck.The multimodal advantageTo maintain this level of accuracy, Guidde employs a multimodal infrastructure. The system doesn&#x27;t rely on a single model; instead, it uses a \"fleet\" of models that evaluate one another.Google Gemini: Generally used for visual tasks like analyzing PDFs or PowerPoints.Anthropic Claude: Leveraged for writing the storyline and narrative scripts.Feedback Loops: When a user edits a video, that data is fed back into the model to prevent the same mistakes from occurring in future captures.This approach allows Guidde to replace a legacy stack of six or seven disconnected tools—Loom for capture, Adobe Premiere for editing, 11Labs for text-to-speech, and Synthesia for avatars—with a single, AI-native platform. \"We basically pack everything for you,\" Einav says, \"and automate the entire process based on your brand guidelines.\"Video-first origin storyThe genesis of Guidde lies in a frustration familiar to any product leader. Before founding the company, Einav and co-founder Dan Sahar spent years mastering video traffic at Qwilt, a company they started in 2010 to analyze how people watched Netflix and Disney+. When COVID-19 hit, they saw a massive opportunity to apply that video expertise to the workplace. They observed that short video explainers could increase free-to-paid account conversions by 30%, but the friction of creating them was unsustainable.In an interview, Einav recalled the \"tedious work\" of the old world: \"My team in Israel were creating the content, someone in the US with a US accent was doing the narration, someone in the marketing team would write the script... and someone in the enablement team would do the edit.\" This fragmented workflow meant a single video took two to three weeks to produce. \"And then two weeks later, the product changes, and you need to redo it from scratch,\" Einav added.Guidde was built to collapse this cycle into seconds. By automating the \"Magic Capture\" of a workflow, the platform generates a structured narrative script and professional AI voiceover instantly. This removes the editing bottleneck, transforming subject matter experts into \"training powerhouses.\"Licensing and market impactGuidde’s pricing structure reflects its transition from a utility to a core piece of enterprise infrastructure:Free: $0 (Up to 25 videos, web-app support).Pro: $18/creator/month (Unlimited videos, brand kits).Business: $39/creator/month (Unlimited text-to-voice, analytics).Enterprise: Custom pricing (Multi-language translation, SSO, Magic Redaction).The platform&#x27;s impact is already visible in the numbers: a 41% reduction in video creation time and 34% fewer inbound support tickets. For customers like Emerson, this translates to 40–60% quicker guide creation. Support teams, in particular, are finding they can offload 80% of their ticket volume with agents—but only if those agents have the content to be useful. \"The agent without the content is useless,\" Einav warns, noting that most enterprise documentation is either years out of date or entirely undocumented.Community and industry early receptionGuidde already claims 4,500 enterprise customers and seeks to expand this number with its new round of funding. Support and operations leaders have been vocal about the platform&#x27;s ease of use. Christopher Cummings, VP of Client Experience at DocNetwork, highlighted its ability to provide \"quick, personalized video responses to customer questions.\" Meanwhile, Wren Cotrone, a Director of Customer Support, noted that \"Once you set the branding the way you want, you can really zoom through this stuff.\"Ronen Nir, Managing Director at PSG, summarized the investment thesis: \"Guidde is solving one of the biggest blockers to successful AI adoption: the knowledge infrastructure.\"Why this matters nowThe paradigm shift from text-only LLMs to agentic video intelligence is the defining trend of 2026. Guidde’s Series B signals that the \"ground truth\" for enterprise agents will come from raw video observation, not static documentation.By capturing how work gets done across 10s of millions of workflows, Guidde is building a dataset that few others possess.

While the App Store can perform those checks automatically, \"developers may have separate obligations to independently confirm that their users are adults,\" Apple wrote.

          "title": "Anthropic just released a mobile version of Claude Code called Remote Control",
          "standfirst": "Claude Code has become increasingly popular in the first year since its launch, and especially in recent months, as developers and non-technical users alike flock to AI unicorn Anthropic&#x27;s hit coding agent to create full applications and websites in days, on their own, that would&#x27;ve taken months and technical teams without. It&#x27;s not a stretch to say it helped spur the \"vibe coding\" boom — using plain English instead of programming languages to write software.But it&#x27;s all been restricted to the desktop Claude Code apps and Terminal command-line interfaces and integrated development environments (IDEs) — until today. Now, Anthropic has added a new mode, Remote Control, that lets users issue commands to Claude Code from their iPhone and Android smartphones — starting with subscribers to Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Max ($100-$200 USD monthly) subscription tier.Anthropic posted on X saying Remote Control will also make its way to Claude Pro ($20 USD monthly) subscribers in the future.The mobile command centerAnnounced earlier today by Claude Code Product Manager Noah Zweben, Remote Control is a synchronization layer that bridges local CLI environments with the Claude mobile app and web interface. The feature allows developers to initiate a complex task in their terminal and maintain full control of it from a phone or tablet, effectively decoupling the AI agent from the physical workstation.Currently, Remote Control is available as a Research Preview for subscribers on the Claude Max tier. While access for Claude Pro ($20/month) users is expected shortly, the feature remains a high-end tool for power users and is notably absent from Team or Enterprise plans during this initial phase. To access the feature, users must follow this guide and update to Claude version 2.1.52 and execute the command claude remote-control or use the in-session slash command /rc. Once active, the terminal displays a QR code that, when scanned, opens a responsive, synchronized session in the Claude mobile app.Less screen time, more IRL time: philosophy of flowThe messaging behind the release centers on the preservation of a developer&#x27;s \"flow state.\" In his announcement, Zweben framed the update as a lifestyle upgrade rather than just a technical one, encouraging users to \"take a walk, see the sun, walk your dog without losing your flow.\"This \"Remote Control\" is not a cloud-based replacement for local development, but a portal into it. According to official documentation, the core value is that \"Claude keeps running on your machine, and you can control the session from the Claude app.\" This ensures that local context—filesystem access, environment variables, and Model Context Protocol (MCP)servers—remains active and reachable even if the user is miles away from their desk.Architecture, security, and setupClaude Code Remote Control functions as a secure bridge between your local terminal and Anthropic’s cloud interface, which provides the Anthropic AI models, Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6, that power Claude Code.When you run the command, your desktop machine initiates an outbound connection to Anthropic’s API for serving the models — meaning you aren&#x27;t opening any \"inbound\" ports or exposing your computer to the open web. Instead, your local machine polls the API for instructions. When you visit the session URL or use the Claude app, you are essentially using those devices as a \"remote window\" to view and command the process still running on your computer. Your files and MCP servers never leave your machine; only the chat messages and tool results flow through the encrypted bridge.To get started, ensure you are on a Pro or Max plan and have authenticated your CLI using the /login command.

          "content": "Claude Code has become increasingly popular in the first year since its launch, and especially in recent months, as developers and non-technical users alike flock to AI unicorn Anthropic&#x27;s hit coding agent to create full applications and websites in days, on their own, that would&#x27;ve taken months and technical teams without. It&#x27;s not a stretch to say it helped spur the \"vibe coding\" boom — using plain English instead of programming languages to write software.But it&#x27;s all been restricted to the desktop Claude Code apps and Terminal command-line interfaces and integrated development environments (IDEs) — until today. Now, Anthropic has added a new mode, Remote Control, that lets users issue commands to Claude Code from their iPhone and Android smartphones — starting with subscribers to Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Max ($100-$200 USD monthly) subscription tier.Anthropic posted on X saying Remote Control will also make its way to Claude Pro ($20 USD monthly) subscribers in the future.The mobile command centerAnnounced earlier today by Claude Code Product Manager Noah Zweben, Remote Control is a synchronization layer that bridges local CLI environments with the Claude mobile app and web interface. The feature allows developers to initiate a complex task in their terminal and maintain full control of it from a phone or tablet, effectively decoupling the AI agent from the physical workstation.Currently, Remote Control is available as a Research Preview for subscribers on the Claude Max tier. While access for Claude Pro ($20/month) users is expected shortly, the feature remains a high-end tool for power users and is notably absent from Team or Enterprise plans during this initial phase. To access the feature, users must follow this guide and update to Claude version 2.1.52 and execute the command claude remote-control or use the in-session slash command /rc. Once active, the terminal displays a QR code that, when scanned, opens a responsive, synchronized session in the Claude mobile app.Less screen time, more IRL time: philosophy of flowThe messaging behind the release centers on the preservation of a developer&#x27;s \"flow state.\" In his announcement, Zweben framed the update as a lifestyle upgrade rather than just a technical one, encouraging users to \"take a walk, see the sun, walk your dog without losing your flow.\"This \"Remote Control\" is not a cloud-based replacement for local development, but a portal into it. According to official documentation, the core value is that \"Claude keeps running on your machine, and you can control the session from the Claude app.\" This ensures that local context—filesystem access, environment variables, and Model Context Protocol (MCP)servers—remains active and reachable even if the user is miles away from their desk.Architecture, security, and setupClaude Code Remote Control functions as a secure bridge between your local terminal and Anthropic’s cloud interface, which provides the Anthropic AI models, Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6, that power Claude Code.When you run the command, your desktop machine initiates an outbound connection to Anthropic’s API for serving the models — meaning you aren&#x27;t opening any \"inbound\" ports or exposing your computer to the open web. Instead, your local machine polls the API for instructions. When you visit the session URL or use the Claude app, you are essentially using those devices as a \"remote window\" to view and command the process still running on your computer. Your files and MCP servers never leave your machine; only the chat messages and tool results flow through the encrypted bridge.To get started, ensure you are on a Pro or Max plan and have authenticated your CLI using the /login command. Simply navigate to your project directory and run claude remote-control to initialize the session. The terminal will then generate a unique session URL and a QR code (toggleable via the spacebar) for your mobile device. Once you open that link on your phone, tablet, or another browser, the two surfaces stay in perfect sync—allowing you to start a task at your desk and continue it from the couch while maintaining full access to your local filesystem and project configuration.From brittle community hacks to official solutionPrior to this official release, the developer community went to great lengths to \"hack\" mobile access into their terminal-based workflows.

          "standfirst": "Anthropic opened its virtual \"Briefing: Enterprise Agents\" event on Tuesday with a provocation. Kate Jensen, the company&#x27;s head of Americas, told viewers that the hype around enterprise AI agents in 2025 \"turned out to be mostly premature,\" with many pilots failing to reach production. \"It wasn&#x27;t a failure of effort, it was a failure of approach, and it&#x27;s something we heard directly from our customers,\" Jensen said.The implicit promise: Anthropic has figured out the right approach, and it starts with the playbook that made Claude Code one of the most consequential developer tools of the past year. \"In 2025 Claude transformed how developers work, and in 2026 it will do the same for knowledge work,\" Jensen said. \"The magic behind Claude Code is simple. When you can delegate hard challenges, you can focus on the work that actually matters. Cowork brings that same power to knowledge workers.\"That framing is central to understanding what Anthropic announced on Tuesday. The company rolled out a sweeping set of enterprise capabilities for Claude Cowork, the AI productivity platform it first released in research preview in January. Scott White, head of product for Claude Enterprise, described the ambition plainly during the keynote: \"Cowork makes it possible for Claude to deliver polished, near final work. It goes beyond drafts and suggestions — actual completed projects and deliverables.\"The product updates are dense but consequential. Enterprise administrators can now build private plugin marketplaces tailored to their organizations, connecting to private GitHub repositories as plugin sources and controlling which plugins employees can access. Anthropic introduced new prebuilt plugin templates spanning HR, design, engineering, operations, financial analysis, investment banking, equity research, private equity, and wealth management. The company also shipped new MCP connectors for Google Drive, Google Calendar, Gmail, DocuSign, Apollo, Clay, Outreach, SimilarWeb, MSCI, LegalZoom, FactSet, WordPress, and Harvey — dramatically extending Claude&#x27;s reach into the software ecosystem that enterprises already use. And Claude can now pass context seamlessly between Cowork, Excel, and PowerPoint, including across multiple files, without requiring users to restart when switching applications.White emphasized that the system is designed to feel native to each organization rather than generic. \"We&#x27;ve heard loud and clear from enterprises — you want Claude to work the way that your company works, not just Claude for legal, but Cowork for legal at your company,\" he said. \"That&#x27;s exactly what today&#x27;s launches deliver.\"Real-world results from Spotify, Novo Nordisk, and Salesforce hint at what&#x27;s comingTo ground the product announcements in measurable outcomes, Anthropic showcased three enterprise deployments that illustrate both the scale and the variety of impact the company claims Claude can deliver.At Spotify, engineers had long struggled with code migrations — the slow, manual work of updating and modernizing code across thousands of services. Jensen explained that after integrating Claude directly into the system Spotify&#x27;s engineers use daily, \"any engineer can kick off a large-scale migration just by describing what they need in plain English.\" The company reports up to a 90% reduction in engineering time, over 650 AI-generated code changes shipped per month, and roughly half of all Spotify updates now flowing through the system.At Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical giant built an AI-powered platform called NovoScribe with Claude as its intelligence layer, targeting the grueling process of producing regulatory documentation for new medicines. Staff writers had previously averaged just over two reports per year. After deploying Claude, Jensen said, \"documentation creation went from 10 plus weeks to 10 minutes. That&#x27;s a 95% reduction in resources for verification checks. Medicines are reaching patients faster.\" Jensen also noted that Novo Nordisk used Claude Code to build the platform itself, enabling contributions from non-engineers — their digitalization strategy director, who holds a PhD in molecular biology rather than engineering, now prototypes features using natural language. \"A team of 11 is operating like a team many times its size,\" Jensen said.Salesforce, meanwhile, uses Claude models to help power AI in Slack, reporting a 96% satisfaction rate for tools like its Slack bot and saving customers an estimated 97 minutes per week through summarization and recap features. The partnership reflects Anthropic&#x27;s broader ecosystem strategy: Jensen described the companies featured at the event as \"Claude partners and domain experts with the data and trusted relationships that make Claude work in the real world.\"Enterprise leaders reveal the messy reality behind AI transformationPerhaps the most illuminating segment of the event was a panel discussion featuring executives from Thomson Reuters, the New York Stock Exchange, and Epic, who provided candid assessments of AI&#x27;s enterprise reality that went well beyond the polished case studies.Sridhar Masam, CTO of the New York Stock Exchange, described his organization as \"rewiring our engineering process\" with Claude Code and building internal AI agents using the Claude Agent SDK that can take instructions from a Jira ticket all the way to a committed piece of code. But he also identified fundamental shifts in how leaders must think. \"The accountability is shifting,\" he said. \"Traditionally, we are so used to building deterministic platforms. You write code requirements and build. And now, with AI being probabilistic, the accountability doesn&#x27;t end when the project goes live, but on a daily basis, monitoring the behavior and outcomes.\" He described a new paradigm beyond \"buy versus build\" — what he called \"assembly,\" the practice of combining multiple models, multiple vendors, platforms, data, and internal capabilities into solutions. And he noted that highly regulated industries must shift \"from risk avoidance to risk calibration,\" because simply avoiding AI is no longer a competitive option.Steve Haske from Thomson Reuters, whose Co-Counsel product has reached a million users, was frank about the gap between what the technology can do and what organizations are ready for. \"The tools are in many senses ahead of the change management,\" he said. \"A general counsel&#x27;s office, a law firm, a tax and accounting firm, an audit firm, need to rewire the processes to be able to take advantage of the benefits that the tools provide. And I think it&#x27;s 18 months away before that sort of change management catches up with the standard of the tool.\" He also stressed an \"ironclad guarantee\" to Co-Counsel customers that \"their input will not be part of our AI output,\" and urged enterprise leaders to be \"feverish\" about protecting institutional intellectual property.Seth Hain from Epic — the healthcare technology company behind MyChart — offered a finding that may foreshadow where enterprise AI adoption is truly heading. \"Over half of our use of Claude Code is by non-developer roles across the company,\" Hain said, describing how support and implementation staff had adopted the tool in ways the company never anticipated. Hain also described a deliberate trust-building strategy: Epic&#x27;s first AI capability was a medical record summarization that included links to the underlying source material, giving clinicians the ability to verify and build confidence before the company introduced more autonomous agent capabilities.A year of Claude Code and MCP adoption explains why this moment feels differentTuesday&#x27;s announcements cannot be understood in isolation. They are essentially the culmination of a year in which Anthropic transformed itself from a research-focused AI lab into a company with genuine enterprise distribution and developer ecosystem gravity.The trajectory began with Claude Code, which Jensen noted had taken coding use cases \"from assisting on tiny tasks to AI writing 90 or sometimes even 100% of the code, with enterprises shipping in weeks what once took many quarters.\" But the deeper structural shift was the adoption of MCP — the Model Context Protocol — which has become the connective tissue allowing Claude to reach into and act upon data across an organization&#x27;s entire technology stack. Where previous AI tools were constrained to the information users manually fed them, MCP-connected Claude can pull context from Slack threads, Google Drive documents, CRM records, and financial systems simultaneously. This is what makes the plugin architecture announced Tuesday fundamentally different from earlier chatbot-style enterprise AI: it turns Claude into a reasoning layer that sits across an organization&#x27;s existing infrastructure rather than alongside it.The implications for the broader AI industry are profound. Anthropic is effectively building a platform play — private plugin marketplaces, portable file-based plugins, and an expanding library of MCP connectors — that echoes the ecosystem strategies of earlier platform giants like Salesforce and Microsoft. The difference is velocity: Anthropic is compressing into months the kind of ecosystem development that previously took years. The company&#x27;s willingness to ship sector-specific plugin templates for investment banking, equity research, and wealth management alongside general-purpose tools signals that it sees no bright line between platform and application, between enabling partners and competing with them.This strategic ambiguity is precisely what has spooked Wall Street. IBM shares suffered their worst single-day loss since October 2000 — down nearly 13.2% — on Monday after Anthropic published a blog post about using Claude Code to modernize COBOL, the decades-old programming language that runs on IBM&#x27;s mainframe systems. Enterprise software stocks had already been under heavy pressure since the initial Cowork announcement on January 30, with companies like ServiceNow, Salesforce, Snowflake, Intuit, and Thomson Reuters all experiencing steep declines. Cybersecurity companies tumbled after the company unveiled Claude Code Security on February 20.Yet Tuesday&#x27;s event triggered a partial reversal that revealed something important about how markets are processing AI disruption. Companies named as Anthropic partners and integration targets — Salesforce, DocuSign, LegalZoom, Thomson Reuters, FactSet — all rallied, some sharply. Thomson Reuters surged more than 11%. The market appears to be drawing a new distinction: companies integrated into Anthropic&#x27;s ecosystem may benefit, while those standing outside it face existential risk.Anthropic&#x27;s own economist warns that AI&#x27;s impact will be uneven — and fastPeter McCrory, Anthropic&#x27;s head of economics, presented data from the Anthropic Economic Index that offered a sober counterweight to the event&#x27;s product optimism. Using privacy-preserving methods to analyze how people and businesses use Claude, McCrory&#x27;s team has tracked AI&#x27;s diffusion across more than 150 countries and every US state.The headline finding is striking: a year ago, roughly a third of all US jobs had at least a quarter of their associated tasks appearing in Claude usage data. That figure has now risen to approximately one in every two jobs. \"The scope of impact is broadening out throughout the economy as the tools and as the technology becomes more capable,\" McCrory said. He characterized AI as a \"general purpose technology\" in the economic sense — meaning virtually no facet of the economy will be unaffected.McCrory drew a critical distinction between automation, where Claude simply executes a task, and augmentation, where it collaborates with a human on more complex work. When businesses embed Claude through the API, he noted, \"we see overwhelmingly Claude is being embedded in automated ways\" — a pattern consistent with how transformative technologies have historically diffused through the economy.On the question of job displacement, McCrory was measured but direct. He noted that \"roles that typically require more years of schooling have the largest productivity or efficiency gains,\" suggesting a dynamic economists call skill-biased technical change. He expressed concern about \"jobs that are pure implementation\" — citing data entry workers and technical writers as examples where Claude is already being used for tasks central to those occupations. But he emphasized that no evidence of widespread labor displacement has materialized yet, and pointed to forthcoming research that would introduce methodology for monitoring whether highly exposed workers are beginning to experience it.His advice to enterprise leaders cut to the heart of the organizational challenge. \"It might not just be about fundamental capabilities of the model,\" McCrory said. \"Do you have the right sort of data ecosystem, data infrastructure to provide the right information at the right time?\" If the knowledge Claude needs to execute a sophisticated task exists only in a coworker&#x27;s head, he argued, \"that&#x27;s not a technical problem, per se. That&#x27;s an organizational problem.\"The question every enterprise leader is now asking — and why no one has the answer yetJensen described a concept Anthropic calls \"the thinking divide\" — the growing gap between organizations that embed AI across employees, processes, and products simultaneously, and those that treat it as a point solution. The companies on the right side of that divide, she argued, will compound their advantage over time. Those on the wrong side \"will find themselves falling further and further behind.\"Whether Anthropic ultimately functions as the rising tide that lifts the enterprise software ecosystem or the wave that swamps it remains genuinely uncertain. The same event that triggered a rally in shares of Anthropic&#x27;s named partners has also accelerated a broader reckoning for legacy software companies that cannot yet articulate how they fit into an AI-native world. McCrory, the economist, counseled humility. \"Capabilities are moving very, very quickly,\" he said. \"It might represent an innovation in the method of innovation. So it&#x27;s not just making us better at the things that we do — it&#x27;s helping us discover new ways to do things.\"Thomson Reuters&#x27; Haske perhaps put it most practically. \"As leaders, we all have to get personally involved and personally invested in using the tools,\" he said. \"We&#x27;ve got to move fast. This environment is changing quickly. We cannot afford to get left behind.\"A Fortune 10 CIO recently told Jensen that enterprises would need to fit a decade of innovation into the next few years. The CIO smiled and said: \"We&#x27;re going to do it in one with you.\" Whether that confidence proves prescient or premature, one thing is clear from Tuesday&#x27;s event — the window for figuring it out is closing faster than most boardrooms realize.",

But he emphasized that no evidence of widespread labor displacement has materialized yet, and pointed to forthcoming research that would introduce methodology for monitoring whether highly exposed workers are beginning to experience it.His advice to enterprise leaders cut to the heart of the organizational challenge. \"It might not just be about fundamental capabilities of the model,\" McCrory said. \"Do you have the right sort of data ecosystem, data infrastructure to provide the right information at the right time?\" If the knowledge Claude needs to execute a sophisticated task exists only in a coworker&#x27;s head, he argued, \"that&#x27;s not a technical problem, per se. That&#x27;s an organizational problem.\"The question every enterprise leader is now asking — and why no one has the answer yetJensen described a concept Anthropic calls \"the thinking divide\" — the growing gap between organizations that embed AI across employees, processes, and products simultaneously, and those that treat it as a point solution. The companies on the right side of that divide, she argued, will compound their advantage over time. Those on the wrong side \"will find themselves falling further and further behind.\"Whether Anthropic ultimately functions as the rising tide that lifts the enterprise software ecosystem or the wave that swamps it remains genuinely uncertain. The same event that triggered a rally in shares of Anthropic&#x27;s named partners has also accelerated a broader reckoning for legacy software companies that cannot yet articulate how they fit into an AI-native world. McCrory, the economist, counseled humility. \"Capabilities are moving very, very quickly,\" he said. \"It might represent an innovation in the method of innovation. So it&#x27;s not just making us better at the things that we do — it&#x27;s helping us discover new ways to do things.\"Thomson Reuters&#x27; Haske perhaps put it most practically. \"As leaders, we all have to get personally involved and personally invested in using the tools,\" he said. \"We&#x27;ve got to move fast. This environment is changing quickly. We cannot afford to get left behind.\"A Fortune 10 CIO recently told Jensen that enterprises would need to fit a decade of innovation into the next few years. The CIO smiled and said: \"We&#x27;re going to do it in one with you.\" Whether that confidence proves prescient or premature, one thing is clear from Tuesday&#x27;s event — the window for figuring it out is closing faster than most boardrooms realize.",

          "standfirst": "Web Search has already been disrupted by AI — just take a look at how readily Google is presenting users with AI Overviews (summaries of search results) at the top of their results pages, how Bing early on integrated OpenAI&#x27;s GPT models, and how Perplexity continues to build on its own AI-driven web search platform and browsers. Nimble announced the launch of its Agentic Search Platform, a system designed to transform the public web into trusted, decision-grade data for AI systems and business workflows. The launch is supported by $47 million in Series B financing led by Norwest, with participation from Databricks Ventures and others, bringing the company&#x27;s total funding to $75 million.The initiative addresses a fundamental bottleneck in the current AI era: while large language models (LLMs) are becoming more sophisticated, they often reason over incomplete or unverifiable external information. Nimble’s platform aims to eliminate this \"guesswork gap\" by providing a governed data layer that searches, navigates, and validates live internet data in real time.In an exclusive interview with VentureBeat, Nimble co-founder and CEO Uri Knorovich reflected on the early skepticism regarding his vision of a machine-centric internet. \"Whenever we started this company, and the first time I went to investors, I told them the web is built for humans, but machines are going to be the first citizens of the web,\" Knorovich recalled. He noted that while initial reactions labeled him as \"too visionary,\" the current reality of AI adoption has validated his thesis.Technology: Coordinated multi-agent architectureThe core of Nimble’s solution is a proprietary distributed architecture that orchestrates specialized agents to perform tasks traditionally handled by human researchers or brittle web scrapers. According to the company&#x27;s infrastructure documentation, the process is broken down into five distinct layers:Headless browser and browsing agents: These layers manage the initial interaction with a target domain, navigating complex site structures as a human would.Parsing agents: These agents interpret the page content, identifying relevant data elements across various formats.Data processing agents: This layer aggregates, filters, and cleans noisy internet data to produce specific, structured answers.Validation agents: The final step involves verifying the results to ensure accuracy and completeness before delivery.Unlike standard search engines designed for consumer link-clicking, this architecture uses multimodal and reasoning capabilities from frontier models—including those from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta—to control real browsers. This allows Nimble to navigate dynamic layouts and cross-check results, producing auditable data outputs rather than simple text summaries.A new paradigm: &#x27;The web is built for humans, but machines are the first citizens&#x27;Knorovich points out that the scale of AI interaction with the web is fundamentally different from human behavior. \"We, as humans, search for maybe three or five options before we making decisions... but every day, Nimble perform more than 3.2 million interactions in the web,\" he explained. This sheer volume of billions of monthly searches represents a programmatic shift that requires a new type of infrastructure.The bottleneck for enterprises today, according to Knorovich, isn&#x27;t the intelligence of the models, but the quality of the data they can access. \"Agents are the headlines, and accurate and reliable web search is the bottleneck,\" he stated.Nimble vs. consumer search: Precision over speedKnorovich explicitly differentiates Nimble from general-purpose tools like Google or consumer AI search assistants. While Google has built a search experience for consumers that is optimized for speed and finding a local restaurant, enterprises require high-scale, high-accuracy results to make multi-million dollar decisions.\"General purpose web search tool are great to have a general answers, such as who is the wife Leo missing,\" Knorovich remarked during the interview. \"But enterprises need deep, granular data, and they need to have the ability to control the search filters, to control the regulation, to control what is a trusted source\". Unlike consumer AI modes that may summarize a Reddit post or high-level news, Nimble provides \"street-level\" information that can be stored directly in an enterprise system of record.Product: Bridging the no-code and developer divideThe Agentic Search Platform is delivered through two primary interfaces designed for enterprise scalability:Web search agents: A no-code AI workflow builder that enables business teams to describe the data they need and receive structured data streams without writing a line of code.Web tools SDK: A suite of APIs for builders to search, extract, and crawl the web directly from their code. This includes specialized tools like the /crawl API for mapping entire domains and the /map API for creating domain trees.The platform is built to deliver data with greater than 99% accuracy — meaning fewer than 1% inaccurate or hallucinated data for the total contents of each search result returned — and a latency of 1-2 milliseconds per request. It integrates natively with major data environments, allowing users to stream clean data directly into Databricks, Snowflake, S3, or Microsoft Fabric.During the interview, Knorovich emphasized that Nimble is designed to be model-agnostic, working seamlessly with state-of-the-art models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google&#x27;s Gemini. This flexibility allows companies to use Nimble alongside their existing tech stack, whether they are running models in the cloud or on-premise for high-security environments like healthcare or banking.Case studies: Accuracy in actionKnorovich provided several real-world examples of how this \"street-level\" data impacts professional workflows. For instance, a real estate broker looking to expand into a new territory doesn&#x27;t need a high-level summary from a general-purpose AI. \"If you want to know what&#x27;s happening in the commercial real estate in Atlanta... you&#x27;re not looking for search that&#x27;s optimized for the millisecond,\" Knorovich explained. \"You&#x27;re looking for street-level, neighborhood-level information... data that you can actually see on a table or download to Excel\".Another use case involves major financial institutions utilizing Nimble for \"know your customer\" (KYC) processes. By deploying an autonomous search agent, banks can cross-reference multiple public reports, criminal records, and address verifications to build a complete profile of a client before they even enter the building. The goal, Knorovich noted, is to provide the \"external truth\" that exists outside an organization&#x27;s internal firewalls.Enterprise licensing and complianceNimble differentiates itself from legacy scraping tools through a rigorous focus on governance and trust. The platform is \"compliant-by-design,\" holding certifications for SOC2 Type II, GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA.Pricing is structured to support both experimental startups and high-scale enterprise operations, aligned with the volume and depth of data retrieved. \"Pricing should be aligned with the value that the user is getting... therefore, we are pricing by the amount of searches that you&#x27;re running,\" Knorovich said.Search and answer APIs: Standard search inputs cost $1 per 1,000, while the \"Answer\" function—which provides reasoning based on search results—costs $4 per 1,000.Managed services: For larger organizations, managed tiers start at $2,000 per month (Startup) and scale to $15,000 per month (Professional) for unlimited agents and priority support.Proxy access: A network of over 1 million residential proxies is available starting at $7.50 per GBCommunity and user reactionsThe transition to agentic search has already been operationalized by several Fortune 500 companies and AI-native startups:Julie Averill, former CIO at Lululemon, stated that pricing intelligence which once took weeks to review can now be responded to in minutes by putting control in the hands of an agent.Itamar Fridman, CEO and Co-founder of Qodo, noted that the platform’s scalability was \"crucial in developing more robust and reliable AI systems\" by feeding LLMs with high-quality data.Dennis Irorere, Data Engineer at TripAdvisor, highlighted that the platform simplifies the extraction of structured data from complex sources, which he described as \"transformative\" for his role.Grips Intelligence reported scaling to over 45,000 e-commerce sites using Nimble’s Web API to deliver real-time pricing and product data.Alta utilizes the platform to power millions of AI-driven go-to-market workflows daily, reporting 3–4× deeper context and >99% reliabilitySeries B to accelerate multi-agent web search and data governanceThe $47 million Series B funding announced alongside the platform will be used to accelerate research in multi-agent web search and further develop the governed data layer. The round saw participation from a wide ecosystem of investors, including Target Global, Square Peg, Hetz Ventures, Slow Ventures, R-Squared Ventures, J-Ventures, and InvestInData.Andrew Ferguson, VP of Databricks Ventures, noted that Nimble complements their Data Intelligence Platform by providing a \"real-time web data layer\" that extends workflows beyond internal sources. This strategic investment signals a shift in the industry toward prioritizing \"external truth\" to ground mission-critical AI applications.For Knorovich, the future of the web belongs to programmatic interaction. \"Programmatic web search is where we are building towards,\" he concluded.

By the end of the trading day, investors had wiped roughly $40 billion from IBM&#x27;s market cap — the company&#x27;s biggest single-day drop in 25 years — pricing the announcement as an existential threat to IBM&#x27;s mainframe business.The reaction was swift. It was also built on a fundamental misreading of why enterprises run mainframes in the first place.IBM&#x27;s COBOL is 66 years old. It was designed in 1959, runs on IBM mainframes, and continues to power transaction processing systems with an estimated 250 billion lines of COBOL in active production, according to the Open Mainframe Project.The engineers who wrote it are retiring; the ones replacing them largely cannot read it.

For enterprises running COBOL on distributed platforms — Windows, Linux and other non-mainframe environments — that capability is genuinely useful and increasingly practical.The actual barrier was never technical\"Modernizing COBOL has been a technically solved problem for a while,\" Matt Brasier, analyst at Gartner, told VentureBeat. \"The real problem is that the costs of modernization are high and the ROI is low.\"Amazon and Google have been offering AI-powered COBOL migration tools for years. AWS Transform and a comparable Google Cloud Platform service both targeted the same problem: reducing friction for customers looking to move mainframe workloads to the cloud.\"This is basically one more source of competition,\" Raj Joshi, senior vice president at Moody&#x27;s Ratings, told VentureBeat. \"IBM has always lived in a very competitive domain. On the margin, this thing is basically negative, no question about that. There&#x27;s one more powerful competitor. But IBM has coexisted with these threats.\"Steve McDowell, chief analyst at NAND Research, cuts to the structural argument: \"Applications don&#x27;t run on mainframes because they&#x27;re written in COBOL,\" he said. \"They run on mainframes because mainframes deliver a class of determinism, scalable compute and reliability that general purpose servers can&#x27;t match.\"The issue runs deeper than market positioning. \"GenAI tools are helpful, but their non-deterministic nature means the resulting code is not consistent — the same operation will be implemented in different ways in different parts of the code,\" Brasier said. \"Leading tools combine deterministic and non-deterministic approaches. None of this solves the ROI problem, though.\"What COBOL translation leaves unsolved\"Translating COBOL is the easy part,\" IBM communications director Steven Tomasco told VentureBeat. \"The real work is data architecture redesign, runtime replacement, transaction processing integrity, and hardware-accelerated performance built over decades of tight software and hardware coupling. That is the problem IBM has spent decades learning to solve, and AI is the most powerful tool we have ever had to do it.\"According to IBM, Royal Bank of Canada, the National Organization for Social Insurance and ANZ Bank have all used watsonx Code Assistant for Z to accelerate modernization of COBOL code without moving off IBM Z.That does not mean Anthropic has no competitive foothold.

Mehta suggests that enterprises pick one well-scoped application slice or workflow with clear inputs and outputs, and evaluate approaches apples-to-apples: quality of dependency mapping, quality of recovered business logic documentation, test coverage and equivalence checks, performance and reliability regressions.In Mehta&#x27;s view, the bigger reminder is that modernization is more than converting code. The hard parts are extracting institutional knowledge, reworking processes and controls, change management, and containing operational risk in systems that cannot break. AI can compress the “analysis and translation” work, but it does not eliminate the governance and accountability burden.\"The teams that win will treat AI as an accelerator inside a disciplined modernization program, with measurable checkpoints and risk guardrails, not as a magic conversion button,\" Mehta said.",

AI can compress the “analysis and translation” work, but it does not eliminate the governance and accountability burden.\"The teams that win will treat AI as an accelerator inside a disciplined modernization program, with measurable checkpoints and risk guardrails, not as a magic conversion button,\" Mehta said.",

The platform faced some initial concerns from users about turning over their IDs and personal information, particularly given how poorly similar policies have been going elsewhere. Discord announced today it will delay and make some changes to its plans in response to the ongoing backlash.The first change is that Discord is postponing the global rollout of its age verification plans until the second half of 2026. The company noted that it would meet its legal obligations in places where they exist, likely in those countries that have national laws requiring protections for younger users. But it will not begin the global rollout until it makes some amendments to the offerings.Discord will offer more alternatives to how users can confirm their ages, including verification by credit card. That should allow people to access age-gated content without sharing an ID or performing a face scan. \"If you're among the less than 10 percent of users who do need to verify, we'll give you options, designed to tell us only your age and never your identity,\" according to a blog post credited to co-founder and CTO Stanislav Vishnevskiy.The company is also promising more transparency about its vendors for these verification services and their practices. Discord said that it will not work with any partners for face scans unless the tests are performed completely on-device. The blog post noted that Persona, one of the common vendors for facial age estimation services, does not meet that standard and Discord has opted not to work with the brand. Finally, Discord is also building a new spoiler channel option so that servers with select age-restricted channels won't have to require all members to verify their ages. It will also publish a technical explainer on its own automatic age determination systems.We at Engadget have own worries about the wave of age verification laws happening both within the US and globally, but it's somewhat encouraging to see a digital platform at least trying to continue to deliver anonymity while still creating effective protections for teens.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/discord-delays-age-verification-to-address-user-concerns-205500482.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Apple still hasn’t revealed a foldable iPhone, but the steady drip of leaks suggests the project is moving closer to reality. Over the past few months, analysts and supply-chain watchers have continued to fill in key details, with most reports still pointing to a launch sometime in the second half of 2026. While Apple hasn’t confirmed anything publicly, the overall picture is starting to look more consistent.As always, plans for unreleased Apple hardware can change at any time. Features may shift, timelines can slip and some prototypes may never ship. Even so, recent reporting gives us the clearest sense yet of how Apple’s first foldable could take shape and where it might fit in the broader iPhone lineup.Below, we’ve rounded up the most credible rumors so far, and we’ll keep this guide updated as new details emerge.When could the iPhone Fold launch?Rumors of a foldable iPhone date back as far as 2017, but more recent reporting suggests Apple has finally locked onto a realistic window. Most sources now point to fall 2026, likely alongside the iPhone 18 lineup, with some supply-chain hints suggesting mass production could begin in mid-2026 if development stays on track.Mark Gurman has gone back and forth on timing, initially suggesting Apple could launch “as early as 2026,” before later writing that the device would ship at the end of 2026 and sell primarily in 2027. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also repeatedly cited the second half of 2026 as Apple’s target.Some reports still claim the project could slip into 2027 if Apple runs into manufacturing or durability issues, particularly around the hinge or display. Given Apple’s history of delaying products that it feels aren’t ready, that remains a real possibility.What will the iPhone Fold look like?Current consensus suggests Apple has settled on a book-style foldable design, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, rather than a clamshell flip phone.When unfolded, the iPhone Fold is expected to resemble a small tablet like the iPad mini (8.3 inches). Based on the rumor mill, though, the iPhone Fold may be a touch smaller, with an internal display measuring around 7.7 to 7.8 inches. When closed, it should function like a conventional smartphone, with an outer display in the 5.5-inch range.CAD leaks and alleged case-maker molds suggest the device may be shorter and wider than a standard iPhone when folded, creating a squarer footprint that better matches the aspect ratio of the inner display. Several reports have also pointed to the iPhone Air as a potential preview of Apple’s foldable design work, with its unusually thin chassis widely interpreted as a look at what one half of a future foldable iPhone could resemble.If that theory holds, it could help explain the Fold’s rumored dimensions. Thickness is expected to land around 4.5 to 4.8mm when unfolded, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, putting it in a similar range to the iPhone Air, and roughly 9 to 9.5mm when folded, depending on the final hinge design and internal layering.iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone AirEngadgetDisplay and the crease questionThe display is arguably the biggest challenge for any foldable phone, and it’s an area where Apple appears to have invested years of development.Multiple reports say Apple will rely on Samsung Display as its primary supplier. At CES 2026, Samsung showcased a new crease-less foldable OLED panel, which several sources — including Bloomberg — suggested could be the same technology Apple plans to use.According to these reports, the panel combines a flexible OLED with a laser-drilled metal support plate that disperses stress when folding. The goal is a display with a nearly invisible crease, something Apple reportedly considers essential before entering the foldable market.If Apple does use this panel, it would mark a notable improvement over current foldables, which still show visible creasing under certain lighting conditions.Cameras and biometricsCamera rumors suggest Apple is planning a four-camera setup. That may include:Two rear cameras (main and ultra-wide, both rumored at 48MP)One punch-hole camera on the outer displayOne under-display camera on the inner screenSeveral sources claim Apple will avoid Face ID entirely on the iPhone Fold. Instead, it’s expected to rely on Touch ID built into the power button, similar to recent iPad models. This would allow Apple to keep both displays free of notches or Dynamic Island cutouts.Under-display camera technology has historically produced lower image quality, but a rumored 24MP sensor would be a significant step up compared to existing foldables, which typically use much lower-resolution sensors.iPhone Fold’s hinge and materialsThe hinge is another area where Apple may diverge from competitors. Multiple reports claim Apple will use Liquidmetal, which is a long-standing trade name for a metallic glass alloy the company has previously used in smaller components. While often referred to as “liquid metal” or “Liquid Metal” in reports, Liquidmetal is the branding Apple has historically associated with the material.Liquidmetal is said to be stronger and more resistant to deformation than titanium, while remaining relatively lightweight. If accurate, this could help improve long-term durability and reduce wear on the foldable display.Leaks from Jon Prosser also reference a metal plate beneath the display that works in tandem with the hinge to minimize creasing — a claim that aligns with reporting from Korean and Chinese supply-chain sources.Battery and other components Battery life is another potential differentiator. According to Ming-Chi Kuo and multiple Asian supply-chain reports, Apple is testing high-density battery cells in the 5,000 to 5,800mAh range.That would make it the largest battery ever used in an iPhone, and competitive with (or larger than) batteries in current Android foldables. The device is also expected to use a future A-series chip and Apple’s in-house modem, with some reports pointing specifically to a next-generation C2 modem as part of Apple’s broader push to reduce reliance on Qualcomm.PriceNone of this will come cheap, that’s for certain. Nearly every report agrees that the iPhone Fold will be Apple’s most expensive iPhone ever.Estimates currently place the price between $2,000 and $2,500 in the US. Bloomberg has said the price will be “at least $2,000,” while other analysts have narrowed the likely range to around $2,100 and $2,300. That positions the iPhone Fold well above the iPhone Pro Max and closer to Apple’s high-end Macs and iPads.Despite years of rumors, there’s still plenty that remains unclear. Apple hasn’t confirmed the name “iPhone Fold,” final dimensions, software features or how iOS would adapt to a folding form factor. Durability, repairability and long-term reliability are also open questions. For now, the safest assumption is that Apple is taking its time and that many of these details could still change before launch.

Now the UK is sending a not-so-subtle message to Reddit on the subject, to the tune of £14.5m ($19.6 million). The nation's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) accused the company of using children’s data and potentially exposing them to inappropriate content.“Children under 13 had their personal information collected and used in ways they could not understand, consent to or control,” UK Information Commissioner John Edwards wrote in a statement. “That left them potentially exposed to content they should not have seen. This is unacceptable and has resulted in today’s fine.”In July 2025, Reddit began requiring age verification to access adult content in the UK, in compliance with the Online Safety Act. However, that's only used to block under-18 users from sexually explicit, violent or other mature posts. The platform also prohibits users under 13 from accessing it altogether — and enforcement of that policy is lax. It merely requires users to declare, when signing up, that they're over 13. The ICO (accurately) described the method as \"easy to bypass.\"In its defense, Reddit told the BBC that it \"didn't require users to share information about their identities, regardless of age, because we are deeply committed to their privacy and safety.\" The company said it would appeal the decision. \"The ICO's insistence that we collect more private information on every UK user is counterintuitive and at odds with our strong belief in our users' online privacy and safety,\" the spokesperson added.\"It's concerning that a company the size of Reddit failed in its legal duty to protect the personal information of UK children,\" Edwards said. \"Companies operating online services likely to be accessed by children have a responsibility to protect those children by ensuring they’re not exposed to risks through the way their data is used. To do this, they need to be confident they know the age of their users and have appropriate, effective age assurance measures in place.”“Reddit failed to meet these expectations,” he added. “They must do better, and we are continuing to consider the age assurance controls now implemented by the platform.” The ICO also accused Reddit of failing to conduct a data protection impact assessment by January 2025.The Guardian notes that the £14.5m fine is the third-largest handed down by the ICO. It trails only a £20m fine for British Airways involving a data breach disclosure and an £18.4m penalty for Marriott Hotels for exposing over 300 million customer records in a hack.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-fined-196-million-over-age-verification-checks-in-the-uk-173705048.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Samsung’s 2025 was filled with new foldables, an ultra-thin new form factor and the launch of Google's XR platform. After making some announcements at CES 2026, the company has announced its first Galaxy Unpacked of the year will take place on February 25, where it is expected to introduce the Galaxy S26 lineup. Official invites have been shared, but actual information on what devices are arriving then is still not completely confirmed. But as usual, we know a lot about what’s expected at Unpacked.Engadget will be covering Galaxy Unpacked live from San Francisco tomorrow, and we'll most likely have hands-on coverage of Samsung's new smartphones soon after they're announced. While we wait for the full details, here's everything we expect Samsung will introduce at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026.When is Unpacked 2026 taking place?According to the official invite that Samsung shared on February 10, Unpacked will happen on February 25, 2026 in San Francisco. The keynote will start at 10AM PT (1PM ET) and be livestreamed on Samsung.com, as well as the company’s newsroom and YouTube channel. The announcement on February 10 also said this launch will mark “a new phase in the era of AI as intelligence becomes truly personal and adaptive.” It’s not a lot to go on, since we’ve heard a version of this from various companies over the last few years, but at least we won’t be shocked when we hear more about AI in just about two weeks.Galaxy S26, S26+ and S26 UltraSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on photoPhoto by Sam Rutherford/EngadgetSamsung's restrained approach to updating its phones will likely continue with the Galaxy S26. Based on leaked images of the new lineup, the company is not expected to radically reinvent the look of the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ or Galaxy S26 Ultra, and instead will stick with a similar design to what it used on the Galaxy S25. The phones will have a flat front screen and frame, with rounded corners and cameras housed in a vertical pill-shaped plateau on the back. Unlike Apple's move from the iPhone 16 Pro to the iPhone 17 Pro, the biggest difference here will likely be internal components like the screens, chips and camera sensors Samsung uses.Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip is expected to be in all Samsung Galaxy S26 phones, though Korean news site Yonhap News reports Samsung's relatively new Exynos 2600 chip could be used in some phones in the lineup depending on the region, a strategy Samsung has deployed in the past. Either way the new phones should be more performant than the previous generation, and in the case of the models with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, particularly good at on-device AI processing.I have compiled the most accurate comprehensive parameter comparison of Galaxy S25, S25+ and Galaxy S26、 S26+. Which one do you want to buy? pic.twitter.com/aQpoSvYjOz— Ice Universe (@UniverseIce) November 29, 2025One notable difference between the Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S25 could be the phone's screen. The new phone will reportedly feature a 6.3-inch FHD+ display according to specs shared by leaker Ice Universe, which makes it ever so slightly larger than the 6.2-inch display used on the Galaxy S25. The S26 will also allegedly come with 12GB of RAM, either 256GB or 512GB of storage and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery. Samsung isn't changing the cameras on the entry-level phone, though: leaks suggest it'll feature the same 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie camera as the previous generation. Changes appear to be even more minor on the Galaxy S26+. Other than the new Snapdragon chip, the phone will reportedly feature the same 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 4,900mAh battery, 12GB of RAM and the same camera array used on the base Galaxy S26.The difference between the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra is reportedly a bit clearer. According to Android Headlines, the new phone's cameras will be slightly more raised, and stand out thanks to a new metallic finish. Samsung may also switch back to using an aluminum frame on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, after using titanium frames on both the Galaxy S24 and S25 Ultras. Most importantly, to make the phone actually support Qi2 rather than only technically work with the standard when a case is attached, rumors suggest Samsung will remove the S Pen digitizer layer in the phone and adopt a new method for accepting stylus input. It's not clear what that new method will actually be, but it could let the Galaxy S26 Ultra more easily work with Qi2 accessories without losing its stylus.Android Headlines also recently shared what appear to be full image renders of the S26 series, and they generally line up with what has already been rumored, leaked and reported so far. If these pictures are accurate, they give us a clearer look at the camera bump and two color variants of the S26 Ultra.Fans of magnets may continue to be disappointed by Samsung if the latest rumors are accurate. Despite the launch of the Qi 2 wireless charging standard adding support for convenient magnetic alignment years ago, Samsung has yet to bring that feature to its phones. Though the S-series have the higher speed charging rates that the spec enables, Nieuwemobiel.nl is reporting that, due to images it received of cases with magnetic rings, the S26 series likely won’t have built-in magnets. Samsung has made these cases to add the magnetic capability to its S-series in the past, and the existence of the images of these accessories lends weight to the idea that the company will continue this approach.Galaxy Buds 4Galaxy Buds 3 Pro in case.EngadgetSamsung released the Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro in 2024, with a major redesign that brought them much more in line with Apple's AirPods. The Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro Samsung is rumored to be announcing soon won't necessarily change that, though they will feature a more compact case and less angular stems, according to leaked images from the Samsung Tips app.Support for head gestures to accept and decline calls, a feature Apple includes on the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4, is also rumored to work on both versions of the new Galaxy Buds. SamMobile reports the Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro may also ship with a new Ultra Wideband chip that will make them easier to find with Google's Find Hub network.Galaxy Z TrifoldYes, the TriFold has a crease, two in fact. But they still don't ruin the experience. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetSamsung announced the Galaxy Z TriFold in late 2025 without firm details of when the new smartphone-that-folds-into-a-tablet would be available in North America. That info came on January 27, when the company announced the TriFold would be available in the US on January 30, for a whopping $2,900. Considering we’ve already seen the device in person at CES 2026 and people are most likely to have had a chance to look at, if not buy the foldable for themselves by the time Unpacked rolls around, we don’t expect Samsung to spend too much time dwelling on it, if at all.Galaxy S26 EdgeAt just 5.8mm thick, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is one of the thinnest smartphones ever made. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetWhen the Galaxy S25 Edge was announced in 2025, it seemed possible that Samsung could replace its \"Plus\" smartphone with a unique form factor, just like Apple has opted to do with the iPhone Air. There have been conflicting reports on the matter, but it seems like Samsung will not be doing that with the Galaxy S26 Edge.Instead, the smartphone will reportedly remain another option, much like foldables are for customers not swayed by Samsung's traditional smartphones. The Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to feature a slightly different design than last year's model, according to Android Headlines, with a large rectangular camera plateau that's reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones, and the raised oval Apple used on the iPhone Air. Beyond that, the phone is also expected to be ever so slightly thinner at 5.5mm than the 5.8mm Galaxy S25 Edge.Bixby and other AI featuresSamsung already acts as a first place Google can show off new AI features for Android, but the company is reportedly exploring other AI partnerships, too. In June 2025, Bloomberg reported that Samsung was nearing a deal with Perplexity to integrate its AI-powered search engine across OneUI and its homegrown mobile browser. Perplexity already has a deal with Motorola on its Razr phones, so the only thing that would make a deal with Samsung unusual is the close relationship the company already has with Google.The company also accidentally announced a new version of its Bixby AI assistant, which will likely also be integrated with Perplexity and could serve as an alternative to Google Gemini. Both a new Bixby and a deeper integration with Perplexity seem like natural new software features to show off at Galaxy Unpacked.On February 17, Samsung teased some mobile AI photography features ahead of Unpacked. These expand the S-series’ existing image-editing tools by bringing the ability “to turn a photo from day to night in seconds, restore missing parts of objects in images, capture detailed photos in low light, and seamlessly merge multiple photos into a single, cohesive result.” A lot of these things are already possible in other photo-editing apps or even in the Google Photos app, but we’ll have to wait to see them in action on the S26 phones for more details on whether they’re different or more effective.The company continued to drip feed more teasers in the week leading up to Unpacked 2026, announcing just a few days later that it’s updated its Bixby assistant to be more conversational. Then, over the weekend, it shared that the S26 series will offer third-party AI agents within Galaxy AI, including Perplexity’s offering. It will allow for the devices to respond to the wake phrase “Hey Plex,” which is sure to be popular and not at all confusing to those who already use a similarly named media server and streaming app. Until we find out more at Unpacked 2026, it’s tricky to determine if and how effective these updates will be, so we’ll just have to be patient until we get the phones in our hands.

          "content": "Samsung’s 2025 was filled with new foldables, an ultra-thin new form factor and the launch of Google's XR platform. After making some announcements at CES 2026, the company has announced its first Galaxy Unpacked of the year will take place on February 25, where it is expected to introduce the Galaxy S26 lineup. Official invites have been shared, but actual information on what devices are arriving then is still not completely confirmed. But as usual, we know a lot about what’s expected at Unpacked.Engadget will be covering Galaxy Unpacked live from San Francisco tomorrow, and we'll most likely have hands-on coverage of Samsung's new smartphones soon after they're announced. While we wait for the full details, here's everything we expect Samsung will introduce at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026.When is Unpacked 2026 taking place?According to the official invite that Samsung shared on February 10, Unpacked will happen on February 25, 2026 in San Francisco. The keynote will start at 10AM PT (1PM ET) and be livestreamed on Samsung.com, as well as the company’s newsroom and YouTube channel. The announcement on February 10 also said this launch will mark “a new phase in the era of AI as intelligence becomes truly personal and adaptive.” It’s not a lot to go on, since we’ve heard a version of this from various companies over the last few years, but at least we won’t be shocked when we hear more about AI in just about two weeks.Galaxy S26, S26+ and S26 UltraSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on photoPhoto by Sam Rutherford/EngadgetSamsung's restrained approach to updating its phones will likely continue with the Galaxy S26.

          "title": "Kilo launches KiloClaw, allowing anyone to deploy hosted OpenClaw agents into production in 60 seconds",
          "standfirst": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, the distance between a developer’s idea and a functioning agent has historically been measured in hours of configuration, dependency conflicts, and terminal-induced headaches. That friction point changed today. Kilo, the AI infrastructure startup backed by GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij, has announced the general availability of KiloClaw, a fully managed service designed to deploy a production-ready OpenClaw agent in under 60 seconds.By eliminating the “SSH, Docker, and YAML” barriers that have gatekept high-end AI agents, Kilo is betting that the next phase of software development—often called \"vibe coding\"—will be defined not just by the quality of a model, but by the reliability of the infrastructure that hosts it.Technology: Re-engineering the agentic sandboxOpenClaw has emerged as a viral phenomenon, amassing over 161,000 GitHub stars by offering a capability that many proprietary tools lack: the ability to actually perform tasks—controlling browsers, managing files, and connecting to over 50 chat platforms like Telegram and Signal. However, as Kilo co-founder and CEO Scott Breitenother noted in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat, \"OpenClaw itself isn&#x27;t the hard part... getting it running is\".The technical architecture of KiloClaw is a departure from the \"Mac Mini on a desk\" model that many early adopters have relied on. Instead of requiring users to provision their own hardware or Virtual Private Servers (VPS), KiloClaw runs on a multi-tenant Virtual Machine (VM) architecture powered by Fly.io, a Chicago remote-first startup offering a developer-focused public cloud. This setup provides a level of isolation and security that is difficult for individual developers to replicate.\"What we&#x27;re doing is making KiloClaw the safest way to claw,\" Breitenother explained during the interview. \"We have a virtual machine that is a hosted OpenClaw instance, and we&#x27;re handling all that network security, sandboxing, and proxies that an enterprise company would require. We are essentially running multi-tenant, hosted OpenClaw\".To ensure security, KiloClaw utilizes two distinct proxies that sit outside the VM to manage traffic and protect the instance from the open internet. This prevents the common \"user error\" of accidentally exposing an agent’s API keys or leaving a local instance vulnerable to external attacks. \"It&#x27;s going to be better than [a local setup] in every single way,\" Breitenother asserted. \"If you were to set it up yourself, you&#x27;d probably miss a setting and end up with it accidentally on the internet or exposing an API key\".Product: The &#x27;mech suit&#x27; and the 3 am crashA primary pain point for OpenClaw users is the “3 am crash”—the tendency for locally hosted Node.js processes to die silently overnight without health monitoring or auto-restart capabilities. KiloClaw addresses this with built-in process monitoring and a cloud-native \"always on\" state.Unlike standard Kilo Code workflows, which spin up a terminal session only when a developer initiates a command, KiloClaw is persistent. \"KiloClaw is just running and listening,\" said Breitenother. \"It&#x27;s always on, waiting for your WhatsApp message or your Slack message. It has to be always on. That&#x27;s a different paradigm—always-on infrastructure to engage with\".This persistence allows for a suite of \"agentic affordances\" that Kilo calls an \"exoskeleton for the mind\":Scheduled automations: Users can set cron jobs for the agent to perform research, monitor repositories, or generate reports while the human user is offline.Persistent memory: Utilizing a \"Memory Bank\" system, the agent stores context in structured Markdown files within the repository, ensuring it retains the state of a project even if the underlying model is swapped.Cross-platform command: The agent can be triggered from Slack, Telegram, or a terminal, maintaining a unified execution state across all entry points.Breitenother highlighted the shift in the developer’s role during the interview: \"We&#x27;ve actually moved our engineers to be product owners. The time they freed up from writing code, they&#x27;re actually doing much more thinking. They&#x27;re setting the strategy for the product\".The “gateway” advantage: 500+ models, no lock-inA core component of the KiloClaw architecture is its native integration with the Kilo Gateway. While the original OpenClaw was initially tied closely to Anthropic&#x27;s models, KiloClaw allows users to toggle between over 500 different models from providers like OpenAI, Google, and MiniMax, as well as open-weight models like Qwen or GLM.\"Your preferred model today may not be the same—and honestly shouldn&#x27;t be the same—a month and a half from now,\" Breitenother said, emphasizing the speed of the industry. \"You may want different models for different tasks. Maybe you use Opus for something complex, or you switch to a tighter-budget open-weight model for routine work\".This flexibility is supported by Kilo&#x27;s transparent pricing model. The company offers \"zero markup\" on AI tokens, charging users the exact API rates provided by the model vendors. For power users, this is managed through Kilo Pass, a subscription tier that provides bonus credits (e.g., $199/month for $278.60 in credits) to subsidize high-volume agentic work.How to get started with KiloClaw right nowSign in or register: Navigate to the Kilo Code application on the web (desktop) at app.kilo.ai and sign in using your existing account. Kilo supports several authentication methods, including GitHub and Google OAuth.Create your instance: Select the \"Claw\" tab from the side navigation menu to access the KiloClaw dashboard. Click the \"Create Instance\" button to begin provisioning your agent (see image above for where to find it). Choose your model: Select a default AI model to power your agent from the dropdown menu. Users can choose from a wide array of options, including free (for the time being) models like MiniMax.Configure messaging channels (optional): During setup, you can optionally connect your agent to Discord, Telegram, or Slack and communicate with your KiloClaw agent directly over those channels — instead of on the Kilo Code website. But to move faster, you may skip this step and are always able to add these supported bot keys and configure these channels later in the instance settings.Provision and start: Click \"Create and Provision\" to set up your virtual machine. Once the instance is provisioned, click \"Start\" to boot the agent, which typically takes only a few secondVerify and access: Click the \"Open\" button to enter the OpenClaw interface. For security, you will need to click \"Access Code\" to generate a one-time verification token that validates your device for the first time.Begin vibe coding: Once verified, you can begin interacting with your agent directly in the chat interface. The agent will remain running 24/7 on a dedicated virtual machine, listening for commands across all connected platforms.According to Brendan O&#x27;Leary, Developer Relations at Kilo Code and former Developer Evangelist at GitLab, users unsure which model to select should consult PinchBench, an open-source benchmarking tool developed to evaluate models on 23 real-world agentic tasks, such as email sorting and blog post generation.Benchmarking the agentic era: the launch of PinchBench, a new open-source benchmarking suite specifically for Claw tasksTo help developers navigate the choice between 500+ models, Kilo has also released PinchBench, an open-source benchmark specifically for agentic workloads. While traditional benchmarks like MMLU or HumanEval test chat prompts in isolation, PinchBench tests agents on 23 real-world, multi-step tasks such as calendar management and multi-source research.The project was spearheaded by O&#x27;Leary, who noted during a demonstration that the benchmark was \"kind of inspired by... other little kind of fun benches\" like those created by developer YouTuber Theo Browne (@t3dotgg), CEO/Founder of Ping Labs. O&#x27;Leary explained that while existing benchmarks are often highly specialized, he wanted a way to \"benchmark the kind of things that we asked OpenClaw to do\". He has personally run the benchmark \"hundreds and hundreds of times against OpenClaw\" to ensure its accuracy, and taking a page out of Browne&#x27;s book (er, video playbook?), also launched a YouTube series to find out if KiloClaw can handle various tasks, entitled, fittingly, \"Will It Claw?\"To maintain high standards of evaluation for subjective tasks like writing blog posts, O&#x27;Leary designed a system where a high-end \"judge model\"—specifically Claude 4.5 Opus—is used to grade the output of other models. \"We actually have... not the model under test, but always Opus... [judge] the output of each of the models,\" O&#x27;Leary stated, adding that the judge model even provides specific notes on execution quality. The benchmark allows users to view a scatter plot comparing \"Cost to Intelligence,\" identifying which models offer the highest proficiency for the lowest price. This specific visualization is a priority for O&#x27;Leary, who noted it is \"my favorite graph for looking at models... how much do you spend versus how much is the success rate\". For those who prefer to host their own infrastructure, O&#x27;Leary has made the process entirely transparent, providing a \"skill file that people can download\" so they can \"benchmark their own OpenClaw instance\" independently\"We&#x27;re doing this work anyway to know which defaults we should recommend,\" Breitenother added in a separate interview. \"We decided to open source it because the individual developer shouldn&#x27;t have to think about which model is best for the job. We want to give people more and more information\". O&#x27;Leary expanded on this philosophy, describing the benchmark as being \"kind of like the Olympics in a lot of ways,\" where tasks range from \"very objectively graded\" to those requiring a more nuanced assessment.Industry context: Distinguishing from the growing OpenClaw family of offshoots KiloClaw enters a market increasingly crowded with OpenClaw variants. Projects like Nanoclaw have gained traction for being lightweight, while companies like Runlayer have targeted the enterprise \"Virtual Private Server\" niche.However, Kilo distinguishes itself by refusing to \"fork\" the code. \"It’s not a fork, and that’s what’s important,\" Breitenother stated. \"OpenClaw moves so quickly that we are hosting the actual OpenClaw [version]. It is literally OpenClaw on a really well-tuned, well-set-up managed virtual machine\". This ensures that as the core OpenClaw project evolves, KiloClaw users receive updates automatically without manual \"git pull\" operations.This \"open core\" philosophy extends to the licensing. While KiloClaw is a paid hosted service, the underlying Kilo CLI and core extensions remain MIT-licensed.

By offering a \"one-click\" path to a production agent, the company is attempting to democratize the \"magical moments\" of AI.According to a release provided to VentureBeat by Kilo ahead of the launch, in the first two weeks, more than 3,500 developers joined the waitlist. These early adopters have been \"really pushing KiloClaw in all kinds of directions,\" using it to automate everything from Discord management to repository maintenance.\"Our mission is to build the best all-in-one AI work platform,\" Breitenother concluded. \"Whether you are a developer, a product manager, or a data engineer, we want all of these personas to experience the magic of the exoskeleton for the mind\".KiloClaw is available now, offering 7 days of free compute for all new users.

          "content": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, the distance between a developer’s idea and a functioning agent has historically been measured in hours of configuration, dependency conflicts, and terminal-induced headaches. That friction point changed today. Kilo, the AI infrastructure startup backed by GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij, has announced the general availability of KiloClaw, a fully managed service designed to deploy a production-ready OpenClaw agent in under 60 seconds.By eliminating the “SSH, Docker, and YAML” barriers that have gatekept high-end AI agents, Kilo is betting that the next phase of software development—often called \"vibe coding\"—will be defined not just by the quality of a model, but by the reliability of the infrastructure that hosts it.Technology: Re-engineering the agentic sandboxOpenClaw has emerged as a viral phenomenon, amassing over 161,000 GitHub stars by offering a capability that many proprietary tools lack: the ability to actually perform tasks—controlling browsers, managing files, and connecting to over 50 chat platforms like Telegram and Signal. However, as Kilo co-founder and CEO Scott Breitenother noted in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat, \"OpenClaw itself isn&#x27;t the hard part... getting it running is\".The technical architecture of KiloClaw is a departure from the \"Mac Mini on a desk\" model that many early adopters have relied on. Instead of requiring users to provision their own hardware or Virtual Private Servers (VPS), KiloClaw runs on a multi-tenant Virtual Machine (VM) architecture powered by Fly.io, a Chicago remote-first startup offering a developer-focused public cloud. This setup provides a level of isolation and security that is difficult for individual developers to replicate.\"What we&#x27;re doing is making KiloClaw the safest way to claw,\" Breitenother explained during the interview. \"We have a virtual machine that is a hosted OpenClaw instance, and we&#x27;re handling all that network security, sandboxing, and proxies that an enterprise company would require. We are essentially running multi-tenant, hosted OpenClaw\".To ensure security, KiloClaw utilizes two distinct proxies that sit outside the VM to manage traffic and protect the instance from the open internet. This prevents the common \"user error\" of accidentally exposing an agent’s API keys or leaving a local instance vulnerable to external attacks. \"It&#x27;s going to be better than [a local setup] in every single way,\" Breitenother asserted. \"If you were to set it up yourself, you&#x27;d probably miss a setting and end up with it accidentally on the internet or exposing an API key\".Product: The &#x27;mech suit&#x27; and the 3 am crashA primary pain point for OpenClaw users is the “3 am crash”—the tendency for locally hosted Node.js processes to die silently overnight without health monitoring or auto-restart capabilities. KiloClaw addresses this with built-in process monitoring and a cloud-native \"always on\" state.Unlike standard Kilo Code workflows, which spin up a terminal session only when a developer initiates a command, KiloClaw is persistent. \"KiloClaw is just running and listening,\" said Breitenother. \"It&#x27;s always on, waiting for your WhatsApp message or your Slack message. It has to be always on. That&#x27;s a different paradigm—always-on infrastructure to engage with\".This persistence allows for a suite of \"agentic affordances\" that Kilo calls an \"exoskeleton for the mind\":Scheduled automations: Users can set cron jobs for the agent to perform research, monitor repositories, or generate reports while the human user is offline.Persistent memory: Utilizing a \"Memory Bank\" system, the agent stores context in structured Markdown files within the repository, ensuring it retains the state of a project even if the underlying model is swapped.Cross-platform command: The agent can be triggered from Slack, Telegram, or a terminal, maintaining a unified execution state across all entry points.Breitenother highlighted the shift in the developer’s role during the interview: \"We&#x27;ve actually moved our engineers to be product owners. The time they freed up from writing code, they&#x27;re actually doing much more thinking. They&#x27;re setting the strategy for the product\".The “gateway” advantage: 500+ models, no lock-inA core component of the KiloClaw architecture is its native integration with the Kilo Gateway. While the original OpenClaw was initially tied closely to Anthropic&#x27;s models, KiloClaw allows users to toggle between over 500 different models from providers like OpenAI, Google, and MiniMax, as well as open-weight models like Qwen or GLM.\"Your preferred model today may not be the same—and honestly shouldn&#x27;t be the same—a month and a half from now,\" Breitenother said, emphasizing the speed of the industry. \"You may want different models for different tasks. Maybe you use Opus for something complex, or you switch to a tighter-budget open-weight model for routine work\".This flexibility is supported by Kilo&#x27;s transparent pricing model. The company offers \"zero markup\" on AI tokens, charging users the exact API rates provided by the model vendors. For power users, this is managed through Kilo Pass, a subscription tier that provides bonus credits (e.g., $199/month for $278.60 in credits) to subsidize high-volume agentic work.How to get started with KiloClaw right nowSign in or register: Navigate to the Kilo Code application on the web (desktop) at app.kilo.ai and sign in using your existing account. Kilo supports several authentication methods, including GitHub and Google OAuth.Create your instance: Select the \"Claw\" tab from the side navigation menu to access the KiloClaw dashboard. Click the \"Create Instance\" button to begin provisioning your agent (see image above for where to find it). Choose your model: Select a default AI model to power your agent from the dropdown menu. Users can choose from a wide array of options, including free (for the time being) models like MiniMax.Configure messaging channels (optional): During setup, you can optionally connect your agent to Discord, Telegram, or Slack and communicate with your KiloClaw agent directly over those channels — instead of on the Kilo Code website. But to move faster, you may skip this step and are always able to add these supported bot keys and configure these channels later in the instance settings.Provision and start: Click \"Create and Provision\" to set up your virtual machine. Once the instance is provisioned, click \"Start\" to boot the agent, which typically takes only a few secondVerify and access: Click the \"Open\" button to enter the OpenClaw interface. For security, you will need to click \"Access Code\" to generate a one-time verification token that validates your device for the first time.Begin vibe coding: Once verified, you can begin interacting with your agent directly in the chat interface. The agent will remain running 24/7 on a dedicated virtual machine, listening for commands across all connected platforms.According to Brendan O&#x27;Leary, Developer Relations at Kilo Code and former Developer Evangelist at GitLab, users unsure which model to select should consult PinchBench, an open-source benchmarking tool developed to evaluate models on 23 real-world agentic tasks, such as email sorting and blog post generation.Benchmarking the agentic era: the launch of PinchBench, a new open-source benchmarking suite specifically for Claw tasksTo help developers navigate the choice between 500+ models, Kilo has also released PinchBench, an open-source benchmark specifically for agentic workloads. While traditional benchmarks like MMLU or HumanEval test chat prompts in isolation, PinchBench tests agents on 23 real-world, multi-step tasks such as calendar management and multi-source research.The project was spearheaded by O&#x27;Leary, who noted during a demonstration that the benchmark was \"kind of inspired by... other little kind of fun benches\" like those created by developer YouTuber Theo Browne (@t3dotgg), CEO/Founder of Ping Labs. O&#x27;Leary explained that while existing benchmarks are often highly specialized, he wanted a way to \"benchmark the kind of things that we asked OpenClaw to do\". He has personally run the benchmark \"hundreds and hundreds of times against OpenClaw\" to ensure its accuracy, and taking a page out of Browne&#x27;s book (er, video playbook?), also launched a YouTube series to find out if KiloClaw can handle various tasks, entitled, fittingly, \"Will It Claw?\"To maintain high standards of evaluation for subjective tasks like writing blog posts, O&#x27;Leary designed a system where a high-end \"judge model\"—specifically Claude 4.5 Opus—is used to grade the output of other models. \"We actually have... not the model under test, but always Opus... [judge] the output of each of the models,\" O&#x27;Leary stated, adding that the judge model even provides specific notes on execution quality. The benchmark allows users to view a scatter plot comparing \"Cost to Intelligence,\" identifying which models offer the highest proficiency for the lowest price. This specific visualization is a priority for O&#x27;Leary, who noted it is \"my favorite graph for looking at models... how much do you spend versus how much is the success rate\". For those who prefer to host their own infrastructure, O&#x27;Leary has made the process entirely transparent, providing a \"skill file that people can download\" so they can \"benchmark their own OpenClaw instance\" independently\"We&#x27;re doing this work anyway to know which defaults we should recommend,\" Breitenother added in a separate interview. \"We decided to open source it because the individual developer shouldn&#x27;t have to think about which model is best for the job. We want to give people more and more information\". O&#x27;Leary expanded on this philosophy, describing the benchmark as being \"kind of like the Olympics in a lot of ways,\" where tasks range from \"very objectively graded\" to those requiring a more nuanced assessment.Industry context: Distinguishing from the growing OpenClaw family of offshoots KiloClaw enters a market increasingly crowded with OpenClaw variants. Projects like Nanoclaw have gained traction for being lightweight, while companies like Runlayer have targeted the enterprise \"Virtual Private Server\" niche.However, Kilo distinguishes itself by refusing to \"fork\" the code. \"It’s not a fork, and that’s what’s important,\" Breitenother stated. \"OpenClaw moves so quickly that we are hosting the actual OpenClaw [version]. It is literally OpenClaw on a really well-tuned, well-set-up managed virtual machine\". This ensures that as the core OpenClaw project evolves, KiloClaw users receive updates automatically without manual \"git pull\" operations.This \"open core\" philosophy extends to the licensing. While KiloClaw is a paid hosted service, the underlying Kilo CLI and core extensions remain MIT-licensed. This allows for community auditing—a critical feature for security-conscious enterprises.Conclusion: toward an agentic futureThe launch of KiloClaw marks a strategic move by Kilo to expand its user base beyond \"wonky\" developers to enterprise managers and non-technical professionals.

          "title": "Seattle Ultrasonics C-200 review: This is the future of kitchen knives",
          "standfirst": "There’s a type of knife tech often seen in science fiction that revolves around vibrating a blade to increase its sharpness. We’ve seen examples of this in franchises like Star Wars (vibroblades), Evangelion (the prog knife), Dune (pulse-swords) and the Marvel universe (vibranium), but what might surprise you is that the underlying science is sound. By vibrating a cutting tool at high frequencies, not only do you reduce friction, you essentially turn the blade into a saw, as tiny oscillations enhance the inherent sharpness of a blade. However, up until recently, this tech largely only existed in fiction or for large companies that have the money to utilize the tech on an industrial scale. But that's changing in a big way for home cooks this year thanks to Seattle Ultrasonics, which is releasing the world's first ultrasonic chef's knife: the C-200. After chopping, smashing and cooking with it for about a month, I'm convinced that this is the future of kitchen knives. Design From afar, the C-200 looks a lot like a regular 8-inch chef's knife, but with a slightly more contemporary design. It features a three-layer san mai blade made from Japanese AUS-10 steel with a 13-degree edge angle per side (26 degrees total). However, upon closer inspection, you'll notice there are some features that seem a bit out of place on a premium knife. The first is that the C-200 doesn't have a full tang, which is the back end of a blade that ideally extends into the handle to provide added strength and durability. This is usually a major no-no, particularly on a $400 knife. However, when you consider that Seattle Ultrasonics needed somewhere to put its vibration tech, there really isn't any room for it other than inside the knife's grip. You won't be able to feel it, but pressing this button allows the C-200's blade to vibrate 30,000 times per second. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The knife's second quirk is that the back of the plastic handle features small indicator lights on either side, which is obviously a bit weird. Furthermore, the entire gray section can be removed to reveal a small 1,100mAh battery with an onboard USB-C port. Frankly, the presence of a battery in a knife is just kind of funky. But hey, the power to vibrate the knife has to come from somewhere because it definitely isn't being generated by your hands. And while Seattle Ultrasonics doesn't include a charging adapter or cable in the box, I don't mind because the company wisely took cues from the larger gadget industry and went with a power spec that's already widely in use. Honestly, I wish more kitchen tech makers would do the same. However, the knife's biggest oddity is the big orange button on the bottom of its handle. This is what you use to make the blade vibrate, which it does at 33kHz. It's positioned well so that it's easy to press regardless of whether you do a traditional pinch grip or if you're a bit more casual and prefer to hold the knife only using its handle. In the future, I can see this button becoming a touch-sensitive sensor, but for now, it's simple and effective. Here's a small selection of knives I own sorted by weight (from top to bottom) compared to the C200: 6-inch Kyocera ceramic knife (97 grams), MAC molybdenum steel chef's knife (110g), Furtif Evercut titanium carbide chef's knife (190g), Seattle Ultrasonics C-200 (328g), Korin carbon steel cleaver (396g). Sam Rutherford for Engadget The main downside to the C-200's design is that at 328 grams (around 0.75 pounds) it's heavier and bulkier than a typical knife. When compared to other knives I own, which are made from a wide variety of materials including, ceramic, molybdenum steel, carbon steel and even titanium carbide, it weighs more than everything else aside from my big Chinese cleaver (396 grams). And while it fits nicely in my hand, my wife said it takes a bit more effort for her to wield. It's not too much to the point where you don't want to use it. But for quick tasks, sometimes I found myself subconsciously reaching for lighter options like my 6-inch ceramic knife, which weighs just 97 grams. How it works From a user standpoint, putting the C-200 to work couldn't be simpler. Just press the button and let the knife do its thing. The big difference from how knives like this work in sci-fi is that there's no audible hum or detectable vibration when it's on. It's practically silent (well, most of the time, but more on that later), so you have to trust that it's on or check the indicator light on the handle. That said, if you still don't believe anything is happening, you can run the edge of the blade under water or scrape it over some cut citrus, at which point the blade's vibration will atomize nearby liquid into a fine mist. It's a cool party trick that also doubles as a way to amp up a cocktail by adding a faint essence of lemon, lime or anything else you can think of. Pushing the C-200's button is super easy, regardless of what kind of knife grip you prefer. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Inside, the knife relies on PZT-8 piezoelectric ceramic crystals to generate up to 30,000 vibrations per second, which propagate down the blade and make the knife function as if it's sharper than it actually is. This all sounds rather fantastic, so how does it function in the real world? In-use To really put the C-200 through its paces, I cooked over a dozen meals that involved neatly slicing or preparing a wide variety of foods — including Hasselback potatoes, flank steak, pork belly, chives, sushi-grade tuna and all sorts of fruit. After prepping four pounds of pork belly with various knives, the C-200 really showed off how much of a difference its vibration tech makes. Sam Rutherford for Engadget In short, the C-200's effectiveness depends a lot on what you're chopping. For soft things like strawberries or a piece of cake, I didn't notice much of a difference. To make things even more difficult, the knife arrived out of the box with an incredibly fine edge — the kind that makes shearing through a sheet of paper child's play. So even though Seattle Ultrasonics says its knife can reduce cutting effort by up to 50 percent, there's not much gain to be had when slicing foods that could just as easily be cut by a butter knife. However, as I used it more, I found that the C-200 excels at cutting through delicate items like tomatoes, scallions and fish, where using a dull knife often results in bruising the food as you chop. This was most evident when I made poke at home, where Seattle Ultrasonic's knife delivered cleaner, more precise cuts than anything else I own. For me, the C-200's $399 price tag is almost worth it just so I have an an easier time making my one of my all-time favorite dishes (lu rou fan). Sam Rutherford for Engadget When I whipped up some pico de gallo, I distinctly noticed how neatly the C-200 sliced through the skin of a tomato, instead of initially putting a crease in it before cleanly passing through its interior — which often happens when using dull knives. An additional benefit is that because of the vibrations, I found some foods like garlic didn't stick to the side of the blade as much. This made it easier to keep track of how much I chopped while simultaneously reducing the mess from things falling willy-nilly during prep. But perhaps the most obvious demonstration of the knife's prowess was when I diced an onion. When using my other knives or the C-200 without powering it on, I could feel when I tried to cut through thicker, more sturdy layers. But then, at the touch of a button, I was able to slice down with practically no resistance. It's almost shocking because it feels like magic. The C-200 truly excels at cutting denser foods like flank steak. Sadly mine ended up closer to medium than medium rare, but that's not the knife's fault. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The C-200 even has the ability to reduce the importance of certain knife techniques. Anyone who's seen all the posts on r/kitchenconfidential about cutting chives will already know what I'm talking about. As J Kenji Lopez-Alt neatly demonstrated, the ideal way to get crisp, clean slices is to do a subtle forward or back cut instead of simply chopping straight down. But with Seattle Ultrasonics' knife, I've found that it's so sharp you can get away with almost any motion and still get good results. And if you do it the right way, things are even better. Other types of food that makes the C-200 really shine are denser ingredients like meat and potatoes, where you can really feel the added cutting power. Previously, when I had to break down thick cuts of protein, I sometimes wished I owned a serrated electric knife. You know, the kind you break out once a year on Thanksgiving and then it sits and gathers dust for the other 364 days. But the C-200 made that desire a thing of that past, as it quickly and easily worked through flank steak while once again producing neat, uniform slices. Sushi-grade tuna is another food that really shows off how the C-200's increased sharpness is better at preserving the delicate texture of the fish. Sam Rutherford for Engadget My favorite application of the C-200 was when I was doing prep for Taiwanese braised pork (aka 滷肉飯). Despite this being one of my most beloved dishes that I taught myself how to cook because I couldn't easily find it from local restaurants, I don't make it very often because it's a lot of work to cut multiple pounds of pork belly into small lardon-shaped pieces. Here, the knife's vibrations made it so much easier to cut through all those layers of meat, fat and skin. If there's any situation where the C-200 makes it 50 percent easier to slice through something, it's this. It might be hard to tell, but I was able to cut chives a little finer and more neatly with the C-200 (left) than with my other knives. Sam Rutherford for Engadget During my testing, two small issues cropped up. While it was quite rare, the knife would sometimes emit a faint high-pitched whine. When I asked Seattle Ultrasonic's founder Scott Heimendinger about this behavior, he was rather frank, saying that this can occur when water or moisture accumulates in just the right spots on the blade. Furthermore, he said this only happens on a small number of V1 models, which the company is working to fix in the future. Thankfully, I don't mind, but if it bothers you, making the noise go away is as easy as wiping down the knife down with a cloth or paper towel. The C-200s battery can be easily removed for cleaning and charging. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The other complication came while I was working through the multiple pounds of pork belly I mentioned earlier. After 10 to 15 minutes of continuous use, the knife beeped and its indicator light turned red. Turns out the knife had overheated, which was something I had not even considered. This led to higher-than-normal temperatures inside the knife's sealed electronics causing it to shut off. But after just 30 seconds, it returned to form. During later uses, I learned that simply taking my finger off the button between tasks, which happens naturally as you prep anyway, was more than enough to stop that situation from happening ever again. On the flipside, I was happy to discover that despite lacking a full tang, the C-200 can handle fairly rough tasks, including laying the knife on its side to smash garlic or jamming it into an avocado to remove its pit. That said, I would really recommend against doing the latter, because between its inherent sharpness and its vibration tech, this is the first knife I've used that can slice cleanly through an entire avocado with almost no extra effort. Cleaning and care The Seattle Ultrasonics C-200 8-inch chef's knife features an IP65 rating for the whole device, though the front half is actually a bit more resistant thanks to an IP67 rating for its button and bolster. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The last big concern about a knife with built-in electronics is how it handles clean-up. Thankfully, the C-200 features an IP65 rating for dust and water resistance. That means it can withstand rinsing and splashes without issue. And it's actually even tougher than that, because the front of the knife, including its bolster and button, are rated IP67. This means it can take full submersions in water if need be. However, just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Good kitchen protocol says you don't throw knives you care about in the sink and forget them, just like how you wouldn't put one in the dishwasher either. But perhaps the greatest advantage of this tech is that it allows you to go longer between needing to get your knives sharpened, which if you're like most home cooks, is probably never. To be clear, I haven't tested this and in some respects I wish I had been able to test out a dull version of the C-200. That said, science dictates that slice for slice, an ultrasonic knife will simply cut better than an equivalent blade without the extra tech. So if you believe in the adage that a dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one because you need to apply more force to get the same results, this is another bonus for both safety and convenience. The not-so-optional accessory Seattle Ultrasonics' wireless charging tile makes it incredibly easy to forget that the C-200 needs to be topped up between uses. Sam Rutherford for Engadget I fully admit the need to keep a knife charged up is a major annoyance and something I or anyone else probably doesn't want to do. Thankfully, Seattle Ultrasonics thought of that by including support for wireless charging via the C-200's magnetic tile and it's dead simple to use. Just toss it on the charger when you're not using and it will take care of itself, so you never have to worry about how much of its normal 20-minute runtime it may or may not have left. There are also holes around back so you can easily mount the charger on a wall or shelf. In short, the added convenience the charging tile brings is so valuable that I don't really consider it an optional accessory. If you're getting the C-200, you need to buy this too, which sadly means you're looking at an all-in price of $500 for the bundle instead of just $400 for the knife by itself. Wrap-up As much as I love old-school knives, they'll simply never be as sharp an equivalent blade with this newfound tech. Sam Rutherford for Engadget After using the C-200, I don't think people need to rush out and throw all their old-school knives in the trash. The beauty of an ultrasonic blade like this is that it can handle everything your old cutlery is meant for, but with the touch of a button, it delivers sharpness unlike anything you've experienced before. And while it has some quirks, they're nothing like the kind you typically encounter on first-gen gadgets. Its biggest drawback is that its magnetic charging tile feels like an essential accessory, but it adds extra cost on top of a product that already has a deservedly premium price tag. Even though I'm sure knife makers will continue tweaking blade shapes and alloy mixes from now until the end of time, the addition of ultrasonic vibrations to a chef's knife unlocks a completely new tier of performance. That's because this technology is additive. All it does is enhance what a blade already does best. And when you look at related gadgets in the maker space, I don't think it's a coincidence that there's a similar revolution that resulted in Adam Savage of Mythbusters fame naming a sonic cutter as one of his favorite things of 2025. When viewed that way, it makes me even more confident that the C-200 is the flagbearer for a new breed of kitchen knives.

But for quick tasks, sometimes I found myself subconsciously reaching for lighter options like my 6-inch ceramic knife, which weighs just 97 grams. How it works From a user standpoint, putting the C-200 to work couldn't be simpler. Just press the button and let the knife do its thing. The big difference from how knives like this work in sci-fi is that there's no audible hum or detectable vibration when it's on. It's practically silent (well, most of the time, but more on that later), so you have to trust that it's on or check the indicator light on the handle. That said, if you still don't believe anything is happening, you can run the edge of the blade under water or scrape it over some cut citrus, at which point the blade's vibration will atomize nearby liquid into a fine mist. It's a cool party trick that also doubles as a way to amp up a cocktail by adding a faint essence of lemon, lime or anything else you can think of. Pushing the C-200's button is super easy, regardless of what kind of knife grip you prefer. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Inside, the knife relies on PZT-8 piezoelectric ceramic crystals to generate up to 30,000 vibrations per second, which propagate down the blade and make the knife function as if it's sharper than it actually is. This all sounds rather fantastic, so how does it function in the real world? In-use To really put the C-200 through its paces, I cooked over a dozen meals that involved neatly slicing or preparing a wide variety of foods — including Hasselback potatoes, flank steak, pork belly, chives, sushi-grade tuna and all sorts of fruit. After prepping four pounds of pork belly with various knives, the C-200 really showed off how much of a difference its vibration tech makes. Sam Rutherford for Engadget In short, the C-200's effectiveness depends a lot on what you're chopping. For soft things like strawberries or a piece of cake, I didn't notice much of a difference. To make things even more difficult, the knife arrived out of the box with an incredibly fine edge — the kind that makes shearing through a sheet of paper child's play. So even though Seattle Ultrasonics says its knife can reduce cutting effort by up to 50 percent, there's not much gain to be had when slicing foods that could just as easily be cut by a butter knife. However, as I used it more, I found that the C-200 excels at cutting through delicate items like tomatoes, scallions and fish, where using a dull knife often results in bruising the food as you chop. This was most evident when I made poke at home, where Seattle Ultrasonic's knife delivered cleaner, more precise cuts than anything else I own. For me, the C-200's $399 price tag is almost worth it just so I have an an easier time making my one of my all-time favorite dishes (lu rou fan). Sam Rutherford for Engadget When I whipped up some pico de gallo, I distinctly noticed how neatly the C-200 sliced through the skin of a tomato, instead of initially putting a crease in it before cleanly passing through its interior — which often happens when using dull knives. An additional benefit is that because of the vibrations, I found some foods like garlic didn't stick to the side of the blade as much. This made it easier to keep track of how much I chopped while simultaneously reducing the mess from things falling willy-nilly during prep. But perhaps the most obvious demonstration of the knife's prowess was when I diced an onion. When using my other knives or the C-200 without powering it on, I could feel when I tried to cut through thicker, more sturdy layers. But then, at the touch of a button, I was able to slice down with practically no resistance. It's almost shocking because it feels like magic. The C-200 truly excels at cutting denser foods like flank steak. Sadly mine ended up closer to medium than medium rare, but that's not the knife's fault. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The C-200 even has the ability to reduce the importance of certain knife techniques. Anyone who's seen all the posts on r/kitchenconfidential about cutting chives will already know what I'm talking about. As J Kenji Lopez-Alt neatly demonstrated, the ideal way to get crisp, clean slices is to do a subtle forward or back cut instead of simply chopping straight down. But with Seattle Ultrasonics' knife, I've found that it's so sharp you can get away with almost any motion and still get good results. And if you do it the right way, things are even better. Other types of food that makes the C-200 really shine are denser ingredients like meat and potatoes, where you can really feel the added cutting power. Previously, when I had to break down thick cuts of protein, I sometimes wished I owned a serrated electric knife. You know, the kind you break out once a year on Thanksgiving and then it sits and gathers dust for the other 364 days. But the C-200 made that desire a thing of that past, as it quickly and easily worked through flank steak while once again producing neat, uniform slices. Sushi-grade tuna is another food that really shows off how the C-200's increased sharpness is better at preserving the delicate texture of the fish. Sam Rutherford for Engadget My favorite application of the C-200 was when I was doing prep for Taiwanese braised pork (aka 滷肉飯). Despite this being one of my most beloved dishes that I taught myself how to cook because I couldn't easily find it from local restaurants, I don't make it very often because it's a lot of work to cut multiple pounds of pork belly into small lardon-shaped pieces. Here, the knife's vibrations made it so much easier to cut through all those layers of meat, fat and skin. If there's any situation where the C-200 makes it 50 percent easier to slice through something, it's this. It might be hard to tell, but I was able to cut chives a little finer and more neatly with the C-200 (left) than with my other knives. Sam Rutherford for Engadget During my testing, two small issues cropped up. While it was quite rare, the knife would sometimes emit a faint high-pitched whine. When I asked Seattle Ultrasonic's founder Scott Heimendinger about this behavior, he was rather frank, saying that this can occur when water or moisture accumulates in just the right spots on the blade. Furthermore, he said this only happens on a small number of V1 models, which the company is working to fix in the future. Thankfully, I don't mind, but if it bothers you, making the noise go away is as easy as wiping down the knife down with a cloth or paper towel. The C-200s battery can be easily removed for cleaning and charging. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The other complication came while I was working through the multiple pounds of pork belly I mentioned earlier. After 10 to 15 minutes of continuous use, the knife beeped and its indicator light turned red. Turns out the knife had overheated, which was something I had not even considered. This led to higher-than-normal temperatures inside the knife's sealed electronics causing it to shut off. But after just 30 seconds, it returned to form. During later uses, I learned that simply taking my finger off the button between tasks, which happens naturally as you prep anyway, was more than enough to stop that situation from happening ever again. On the flipside, I was happy to discover that despite lacking a full tang, the C-200 can handle fairly rough tasks, including laying the knife on its side to smash garlic or jamming it into an avocado to remove its pit. That said, I would really recommend against doing the latter, because between its inherent sharpness and its vibration tech, this is the first knife I've used that can slice cleanly through an entire avocado with almost no extra effort. Cleaning and care The Seattle Ultrasonics C-200 8-inch chef's knife features an IP65 rating for the whole device, though the front half is actually a bit more resistant thanks to an IP67 rating for its button and bolster. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The last big concern about a knife with built-in electronics is how it handles clean-up. Thankfully, the C-200 features an IP65 rating for dust and water resistance. That means it can withstand rinsing and splashes without issue. And it's actually even tougher than that, because the front of the knife, including its bolster and button, are rated IP67. This means it can take full submersions in water if need be. However, just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Good kitchen protocol says you don't throw knives you care about in the sink and forget them, just like how you wouldn't put one in the dishwasher either. But perhaps the greatest advantage of this tech is that it allows you to go longer between needing to get your knives sharpened, which if you're like most home cooks, is probably never. To be clear, I haven't tested this and in some respects I wish I had been able to test out a dull version of the C-200. That said, science dictates that slice for slice, an ultrasonic knife will simply cut better than an equivalent blade without the extra tech. So if you believe in the adage that a dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one because you need to apply more force to get the same results, this is another bonus for both safety and convenience. The not-so-optional accessory Seattle Ultrasonics' wireless charging tile makes it incredibly easy to forget that the C-200 needs to be topped up between uses. Sam Rutherford for Engadget I fully admit the need to keep a knife charged up is a major annoyance and something I or anyone else probably doesn't want to do. Thankfully, Seattle Ultrasonics thought of that by including support for wireless charging via the C-200's magnetic tile and it's dead simple to use. Just toss it on the charger when you're not using and it will take care of itself, so you never have to worry about how much of its normal 20-minute runtime it may or may not have left. There are also holes around back so you can easily mount the charger on a wall or shelf. In short, the added convenience the charging tile brings is so valuable that I don't really consider it an optional accessory. If you're getting the C-200, you need to buy this too, which sadly means you're looking at an all-in price of $500 for the bundle instead of just $400 for the knife by itself. Wrap-up As much as I love old-school knives, they'll simply never be as sharp an equivalent blade with this newfound tech. Sam Rutherford for Engadget After using the C-200, I don't think people need to rush out and throw all their old-school knives in the trash. The beauty of an ultrasonic blade like this is that it can handle everything your old cutlery is meant for, but with the touch of a button, it delivers sharpness unlike anything you've experienced before. And while it has some quirks, they're nothing like the kind you typically encounter on first-gen gadgets. Its biggest drawback is that its magnetic charging tile feels like an essential accessory, but it adds extra cost on top of a product that already has a deservedly premium price tag. Even though I'm sure knife makers will continue tweaking blade shapes and alloy mixes from now until the end of time, the addition of ultrasonic vibrations to a chef's knife unlocks a completely new tier of performance. That's because this technology is additive. All it does is enhance what a blade already does best. And when you look at related gadgets in the maker space, I don't think it's a coincidence that there's a similar revolution that resulted in Adam Savage of Mythbusters fame naming a sonic cutter as one of his favorite things of 2025. When viewed that way, it makes me even more confident that the C-200 is the flagbearer for a new breed of kitchen knives.

This approach allows Smarsh to move work forward automatically across data and workflows, achieving greater efficiency without compromising the strict compliance rigor required by their industry.

Smarsh is regularly audited not just by regulatory bodies but also by the banks and financial institutions that have to comply with stringent data protection rules and ask for model risk management, (MRM). \"The safety regulators and banks ask for MRM,\" Khanna says. \"They say, ‘Tell me that all my data is not going to the public because it’s connecting with an LLM.

Now we see the uptake, and we hope to see that continue when we roll out Archie to the rest of our products.\"Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

In fact, I compared it negatively to the extremely not-good Vinfast VF8. Lexus knew there was room for improvement, too, so it reworked the RZ with new motors, a new battery, and NACS charging for North America, among other tweaks, for model year 2026. A front-wheel drive RZ 350e is now the range's entry point at $47,295, and there's also a $58,295 all-wheel drive RZ 550e F Sport that tops the range. We spent a week with the latter. Mindful of how little I liked the first RZ I drove, I made sure to approach the 550e F Sport with an open mind. And despite a number of the car's shortcomings, I find I have warm feelings for the electric Lexus.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "The urine of chimpanzees contains high levels of alcohol byproduct, most likely because the chimps regularly gorge themselves on fermented fruit, according to a new paper published in the journal Biology Letters. It's the latest evidence in support of a hotly debated theory regarding the evolutionary origins of human fondness for alcohol. As previously reported, in 2014, University of California, Berkeley (UCB) biologist Robert Dudley wrote a book called The Drunken Monkey: Why We Drink and Abuse Alcohol. His controversial “drunken monkey hypothesis” proposed that the human attraction to alcohol goes back about 18 million years, to the origin of the great apes, and that social communication and sharing food evolved to better identify the presence of fruit from a distance. At the time, skeptical scientists insisted that this was unlikely because chimpanzees and other primates just don’t eat fermented fruit or nectar. But reports of primates doing just that have grown over the ensuing two decades. Earlier this year, we reported that researchers had caught wild chimpanzees on camera engaging in what appears to be sharing fermented African breadfruit with measurable alcoholic content. That observational data was the first evidence of the sharing of alcoholic foods among nonhuman great apes in the wild. The authors measured the alcohol content of the fruit with a handy portable breathalyzer and found almost all of the fallen fruit (90 percent) contained some ethanol, with the ripest containing the highest levels—the equivalent of 0.61 percent ABV (alcohol by volume).Read full article Comments",

          "content": "On Tuesday, the US Energy Information Administration released full-year data on how the country generated electricity in 2025. It's a bit of a good news/bad news situation. The bad news is that overall demand rose appreciably, and a fair chunk of that was met by additional coal use. On the good side, solar continued its run of astonishing growth, generating 35 percent more power than a year earlier and surpassing hydroelectric power for the first time. Shifting markets Overall, electrical consumption in the US rose by 2.8 percent, or about 121 terawatt-hours. Consumption had been largely flat for several decades, with efficiency and the decline of industry offsetting the effects of population and economic growth. There were plenty of year-to-year changes, however, driven by factors ranging from heating and cooling demand to a global pandemic. Given that history, the growth in demand in 2025 is a bit concerning, but it's not yet a clear signal that the factors that will inevitably drive growth have kicked in. (These factors include things like the switch to heat pumps, the electrification of transportation, and the growth in data centers. While the first two of those involve a more efficient use of energy overall, they involve electricity replacing direct use of fossil fuels, and so will increase demand on the grid.)Read full article Comments",

Among the supercar brands, Lamborghini has always stood out as favoring drama over lap times. And while electric motors and their instant torque can make a car accelerate very quickly indeed, other than the G-forces, it happens with such little fuss. Working out how to imbue an EV with enough \"wow\" factor to wear the famous bull badge has proved so difficult that the company has thrown in the towel in favor of developing more plug-in hybrids. As part of Volkswagen Group, Lamborghini has access to the EV platforms used by fellow VW Group brands Audi and Porsche, so it's not a question of access to technology. Rather, the company just doesn't think it can sell the cars. As Tim Stevens found out for Ars last year, in this rarefied end of the car market, the customers just aren't interested in EVs. People paying six or even seven figures for a supercar, especially a Lamborghini, are not exercising restraint, and they don't want the car to do that, either. Speaking to the Sunday Times this weekend, Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann revealed that the Lanzador, an electric SUV under development for the past few years, was canceled in late 2025. \"Investing heavily in full-EV development when the market and customer base are not ready would be an expensive hobby, and financially irresponsible towards shareholders, customers [and] to our employees and their families,\" he told the paper.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Scotch tape has been a household mainstay for nearly a century, but it still holds some scientific surprises. Researchers have discovered that the screeching sound emitted when one rapidly peels Scotch tape—akin to the screech of fingernails on a chalkboard—is the result of shock waves produced by micro-cracks propagating along the tape at supersonic speeds, according to a new paper published in the journal Physical Review E. It was a 3M engineer named Richard Drew who developed the first transparent sticky tape in 1930. The impetus came from car manufacturing, specifically two-color designs, where the adhesives used were so sticky they often removed the paint when peeled off; the paint then needed to be manually touched up. Drew found a sandpaper adhesive with just the right amount of stickiness and used it to coat a roll of cellophane tape. (Fun fact: Drew also co-invented the snail-style dispenser for the tape with his 3M colleague, John Borden.) The tape was hugely popular during the Great Depression; consumers used it to repair everyday items rather than replace them. That popularity has never waned. Scotch tape has also generated considerable interest among physicists. Back in 1939, scientists noticed that peeling tape could produce light—specifically, a glowing line where the tape end pulls away from the roll. The phenomenon was first recorded in the 17th century and is known as triboluminescence: the generation of light when a material is crushed, ripped, rubbed, or scratched. Diamonds, for instance, sometimes glow blue or red during the cutting process, while ceramics emit yellow-orange light when being cut by abrasive water jets.Read full article Comments",
