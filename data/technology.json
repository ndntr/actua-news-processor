Trump sued YouTube over his account being suspended after Trump supporters' January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Alphabet agreed to pay $22 million \"to settle and resolve with Plaintiff Donald J. Trump... which he has directed to be contributed, on his behalf, to the Trust for the National Mall, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating the National Mall, to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom,\" a court filing said. Trump recently announced plans for the 90,000-square-foot ballroom. The settlement notice, filed today in US District Court for the Northern District of California, said Alphabet will also pay $2.5 million to settle claims with plaintiffs the American Conservative Union, Andrew Baggiani, Austen Fletcher, Maryse Veronica Jean-Louis, Frank Valentine, Kelly Victory, and Naomi Wolf. Under the settlement, Alphabet admits no wrongdoing and the parties agreed to dismiss the case.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "On Monday, Anthropic released Claude Sonnet 4.5, a new AI language model the company calls its \"most capable model to date,\" with improved coding and computer use capabilities. The company also revealed Claude Code 2.0, a command-line AI agent for developers, and the Claude Agent SDK, which is a tool developers can use to build their own AI coding agents. Anthropic says it has witnessed Sonnet 4.5 working continuously on the same project \"for more than 30 hours on complex, multi-step tasks,\" though the company did not provide specific details about the tasks. In the past, agentic models have been known to typically lose coherence over long periods of time as errors accumulate and context windows (a type of short-term memory for the model) fill up. In the past, Anthropic has mentioned that previous Claude 4.0 models have played Pokémon for over 24 hours or refactored code for seven hours. To understand why Sonnet exists, you need to know a bit about how AI language models work. Traditionally, Anthropic has produced three differently sized AI models in the Claude family: Haiku (the smallest), Sonnet (mid-range), and Opus (the largest). Anthropic last updated Haiku in November 2024 (to 3.5), Sonnet this past May (to 4.0), and Opus in August (to 4.1). Model size in parameters, which are values stored in its neural network, is roughly proportional to overall contextual depth (the number of multidimensional connections between concepts, which you might call \"knowledge\") and better problem-solving capability, but larger models are also slower and more expensive to run. So AI companies always seek a sweet spot in the middle with reasonable performance-cost trade-offs. Claude Sonnet has filled that role for Anthropic quite well for several years now.Read full article Comments",

F-Droid has been around for about 15 years and is the largest source of free and open source software (FOSS) for Android. Because the apps in F-Droid are not installed via the Play Store, you have to sideload each APK manually, and Google is targeting that process in the name of security. Several weeks ago, Google announced plans to force all Android app developers to register their apps and identity with Google. Apps that have not been validated by the Big G will not be installable on any certified Android devices in the future. Since virtually every Android device outside of China runs Google services, that means Google is in control of the software we get to install on Android.Read full article Comments",

Share in EA closed at $193.35 on Friday after reports of the private sale first broke and are selling for roughly $203.50 per share in pre-market trading as of this writing.

But the Nürburgring, a 13-mile (20 km) track often called the Green Hell, rarely hits the radar of mainstream US performance aficionados. That's because American car companies rarely take the time to run cars there, and if they do, it's in secrecy, to test pre-production machines cloaked in camouflage without publishing official times. The track's domestic profile has lately been on the rise, though. Late last year, Ford became the first American manufacturer to run a sub-7-minute lap: 6:57.685 from its ultra-high-performance Mustang GTD. It then did better, announcing a 6:52.072 lap time in May. Two months later, Chevrolet set a 6:49.275 lap time with the hybrid Corvette ZR1X, becoming the new fastest American car around that track. It's a vehicular war of escalation, but it's about much more than bragging rights.Read full article Comments",

Coral reefs flourished with crinoids, sponges, jellyfish, and crustaceans; Dragonflies buzzed above the water as small reptiles sunned themselves at the water’s edge. Pterosaurs and Archaeopteryx took to the skies, but there was trouble in this Jurassic paradise: Tropical storms would turn it into a pterosaur graveyard. What paleontologist Rab Smyth found in this graveyard finally revealed why so many fledgling pterosaurs had succumbed to the storm. Smyth, a researcher at the Center for Paleobiology and Biosphere Evolution at the University of Leicester, unearthed two Pterodactylus antiquus hatchlings, and their bones showed exactly how they had succumbed to storm winds. The wings of both specimens (ironically named Lucky I and Lucky II) revealed clean, slanted humerus fractures that suggested they had been twisted in the storm. Unable to fly, they drowned and were rapidly buried in the lagoon depths. “Our results show that most pterosaurs are preserved predominantly through catastrophic events, often reflecting mass mortality episodes,” Smyth and his research team said in a study he led, recently published in Current Biology.Read full article Comments",
