The rocket's 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines roared to life at 6:23 pm CDT (7:23 pm EDT; 23:23 UTC), throttling up to generate some 16.7 million pounds of thrust, by large measure more powerful than any rocket before Starship. Moments later, the 404-foot-tall (123.1-meter) rocket began a vertical climb away from SpaceX's test site in Starbase, Texas, near the US-Mexico border. From then on, the rocket executed its flight plan like clockwork. This was arguably SpaceX's most successful Starship test flight to date. The only flight with a similar claim occurred one year ago Monday, when the company caught the rocket's Super Heavy booster back at the launch pad after soaring to the uppermost fringes of the atmosphere. But that flight didn't accomplish as much in space.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Netflix is no longer just a home for TV shows, movies, documentaries, and live WWE matches — soon, you’ll be able to stream video podcasts, too. The streaming giant announced on Tuesday that it’s partnering with Spotify’s podcast studio and The Ringer to offer 16 series on its platform, including The Bill Simmons Podcast, Conspiracy Theories, as well as The Ringer’s shows on the NFL, NBA, Fantasy Football, and F1. The podcasts will appear on Netflix in the US starting in 2026 before expanding to other countries. As part of the deal, the shows won’t appear “in their entirety” on YouTube, according to a report from The New York Times. Not only is YouTube Netflix’s biggest rival, it also tops Spotify and Apple Music as the most popular podcast streaming platform, raking in more than 1 billion listeners each month. Video podcasts, which show hosts during their conversations, are becoming increasingly popular as creators try to expand their reach across social media. Netflix won’t show commercial breaks for this first round of video podcasts, but Spotify’s ads within the podcasts will remain, the Times reports. The streaming service already produces several podcasts about its shows, like You Cannot Make This Up, Skip Intro, and We Have the Receipts, which also appear on YouTube. In April, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos hinted at bringing podcasts to the platform during an earnings call, saying, “As the popularity of video podcasts grow, I suspect you&#8217;ll see some of them find their way to Netflix.” It sounds like Spotify has more plans to expand the reach of its podcasts, too, as the company says it aims to “bring similar opportunities to a wider range of creators” in the future.

The new attack, named Pixnapping by the team of academic researchers who devised it, requires a victim to first install a malicious app on an Android phone or tablet. The app, which requires no system permissions, can then effectively read data that any other installed app displays on the screen. Pixnapping has been demonstrated on Google Pixel phones and the Samsung Galaxy S25 phone and likely could be modified to work on other models with additional work. Google released mitigations last month, but the researchers said a modified version of the attack works even when the update is installed. Like taking a screenshot Pixnapping attacks begin with the malicious app invoking Android programming interfaces that cause the authenticator or other targeted apps to send sensitive information to the device screen. The malicious app then runs graphical operations on individual pixels of interest to the attacker. Pixnapping then exploits a side channel that allows the malicious app to map the pixels at those coordinates to letters, numbers, or shapes.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Meta has removed a Facebook page dedicated to tracking Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) action in Chicago after the Justice Department got involved. Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X Tuesday that Facebook had taken down an unnamed “large group page that was being used to dox and target” ICE agents after outreach from the DOJ. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone confirmed the group, which he did not identify, “was removed for violating our policies against coordinated harm.” Its removal follows Apple and Google blocking ICE-tracking apps, also following government demands. The DOJ declined to comment beyond Bondi’s post, and ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether specific credible threats were made to ICE agents on the page. The DOJ appears to have taken action after Laura Loomer, a right-wing influencer who has led several campaigns against federal workers she deems disloyal to Trump, posted about a Facebook group called “ICE Sighting- Chicagoland” that she claimed “is providing location updates on ICE raids and ICE agent locations in the Chicago area.” While neither the DOJ nor Meta confirmed the name of the group taken down, Loomer claimed a DOJ source told her the agency had seen her post and contacted Meta about such pages. As President Donald Trump has ramped up immigration enforcement across the country, including through more aggressive tactics like workplace raids, several tools and community groups have popped up to alert people to ICE’s presence in their area. The ICEBlock app used to anonymously report ICE sightings rose to the top of Apple’s app store this summer before it was similarly removed by Apple after the DOJ reached out, with Bondi claiming it was “designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs.” ICEBlock developer Joshua Aaron told Fox News Digital it was “patently false” that the app “served to harm law enforcement officers.” Bondi’s statement raises questions about whether the government engaged in illegal jawboning As private sector businesses, Apple and Meta can generally legally remove groups or apps as they see fit. But Bondi’s statement raises questions about whether the government engaged in illegal jawboning, or pressuring private actors to take down legal speech. It’s not clear precisely what the DOJ said to platforms that prompted them to take action, or whether Meta might have removed the page even without government intervention. But the administration has recently suggested that a broad range of speech might constitute actionable support for domestic terrorism and pledged to crack down on it. The incident is particularly notable since President Donald Trump and other Republicans have repeatedly characterized the Biden administration’s outreach to tech platforms over covid and voting misinformation as censorship, slamming the government’s role in flagging posts they labeled harmful to voting engagement or public health. Conservative state AGs sued the administration in a case that went all the way to the Supreme Court, which did not find a “concrete link” between the platforms’ removal decisions and the government’s communication with the tech executives. There’s also little direct evidence that ICE-tracking tools have led to violence. The administration amped up pressure after claiming that a shooter at a Dallas field office in September used tracking apps, but it’s unclear what, if any, role they played in the attack (which led to the deaths of two detainees and no ICE officers). ICE agents have experienced more assaults as their presence in American communities has increased, but to a far lower degree than the government has claimed, a recent National Public Radio report found.",

The company has announced \"Help Me Schedule\" is coming to Gmail, leveraging Gemini AI to recognize when you want to schedule a meeting and offering possible meeting times for the email recipient to choose. The new meeting feature is reminiscent of Magic Cue on Google's latest Pixel phones. As you type emails, Gmail will be able to recognize when you are planning a meeting. A Help Me Schedule button will appear in the toolbar. Upon clicking, Google's AI will swing into action and find possible meeting times that match the context of your message and are available in your calendar. When you engage with Help me schedule, the AI generates an in-line meeting widget for your message. The recipient can select the time that works for them, and that's it—the meeting is scheduled for both parties. What about meetings with more than one invitee? Google says the feature won't support groups at launch.Read full article Comments",

Gemini Air doesn’t require a DirecTV satellite connection, and DirecTV gives all of its Internet customers the device. DirecTV first started selling Gemini devices in 2023, when it launched a separate Gemini set-top box that connects through DirecTV satellite setups. DirecTV made an agreement with Glance to show AI-generated content and ads on Gemini devices' screensavers. Currently, Gemini devices show Google wallpapers as screensavers, which are on by default.

Today, General Motors revealed that will result in a $1.6 billion hit to its balance sheet when it reports its Q3 results late this month, according to its 8-K. Q3 was a decent one for GM, with sales up 8 percent year on year and up 10 percent for the year to date.

This end-of-support date comes about a decade after the initial release of Windows 10, which is typical for most Windows versions. But it comes just four years after Windows 10 was replaced by Windows 11, a version with stricter system requirements that left many older-but-still-functional PCs with no officially supported upgrade path. As a result, Windows 10 still runs on roughly 40 percent of the world's Windows PCs (or around a third of US-based PCs), according to StatCounter data. But this end-of-support date also isn't set in stone. Home users with Windows 10 PCs can enroll in Microsoft's Extended Security Updates (ESU) program, which extends the support timeline by another year.

The Netflix rival that has brought us critically acclaimed shows and movies like Slow Horses and The Lost Bus has gone from Apple TV+ to Apple TV. Apple announced the name change today in a press release that was primarily about the film F1: The Movie coming to its streaming service on December 12. Unlike previous announcements, however, today’s release referred to the streaming service as Apple TV, instead of Apple TV+. The announcement reads: Apple TV+ is now simply Apple TV, with a vibrant new identity. Apple didn’t specify how its streaming service’s “identity” has changed at all. As of this writing, accessing Apple’s streaming service via a browser or smart TV app still shows the original Apple TV+ branding.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "The encryption protecting communications against criminal and nation-state snooping is under threat. As private industry and governments get closer to building useful quantum computers, the algorithms protecting Bitcoin wallets, encrypted web visits, and other sensitive secrets will be useless. No one doubts the day will come, but as the now-common joke in cryptography circles observes, experts have been forecasting this cryptocalypse will arrive in the next 15 to 30 years for the past 30 years. The uncertainty has created something of an existential dilemma: Should network architects spend the billions of dollars required to wean themselves off quantum-vulnerable algorithms now, or should they prioritize their limited security budgets fighting more immediate threats such as ransomware and espionage attacks? Given the expense and no clear deadline, it’s little wonder that less than half of all TLS connections made inside the Cloudflare network and only 18 percent of Fortune 500 networks support quantum-resistant TLS connections. It's all but certain that many fewer organizations still are supporting quantum-ready encryption in less prominent protocols. Triumph of the cypherpunks One exception to the industry-wide lethargy is the engineering team that designs the Signal Protocol, the open source engine that powers the world’s most robust and resilient form of end-to-end encryption for multiple private chat apps, most notably the Signal Messenger. Eleven days ago, the nonprofit entity that develops the protocol, Signal Messenger LLC, published a 5,900-word write-up describing its latest updates that bring Signal a significant step toward being fully quantum-resistant.Read full article Comments",

You can watch a livestream of the flight here. SpaceX's control team, positioned a couple of miles away from the launch pad at Starbase, Texas, will oversee the loading of more than 10.5 million pounds of super-cold methane and liquid oxygen into the two-stage rocket beginning about an hour before liftoff.

Across those two schools, at least 153 unvaccinated children were exposed to the virus and have been put in a 21-day quarantine, during which they are barred from attending school, state officials said in a press conference. Twenty-one days is the maximum incubation period, spanning from when a person is exposed to when they would develop a rash if infected.Read full article Comments",
