          "standfirst": "Agents built on top of today&#x27;s models often break with simple changes — a new library, a workflow modification — and require a human engineer to fix it. That&#x27;s one of the most persistent challenges in deploying AI for the enterprise: creating agents that can adapt to dynamic environments without constant hand-holding. While today&#x27;s models are powerful, they are largely static.To address this, researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara have developed Group-Evolving Agents (GEA), a new framework that enables groups of AI agents to evolve together, sharing experiences and reusing their innovations to autonomously improve over time.In experiments on complex coding and software engineering tasks, GEA substantially outperformed existing self-improving frameworks. Perhaps most notably for enterprise decision-makers, the system autonomously evolved agents that matched or exceeded the performance of frameworks painstakingly designed by human experts.The limitations of &#x27;lone wolf&#x27; evolutionMost existing agentic AI systems rely on fixed architectures designed by engineers. These systems often struggle to move beyond the capability boundaries imposed by their initial designs. To solve this, researchers have long sought to create self-evolving agents that can autonomously modify their own code and structure to overcome their initial limits. This capability is essential for handling open-ended environments where the agent must continuously explore new solutions.However, current approaches to self-evolution have a major structural flaw. As the researchers note in their paper, most systems are inspired by biological evolution and are designed around \"individual-centric\" processes. These methods typically use a tree-structured approach: a single \"parent\" agent is selected to produce offspring, creating distinct evolutionary branches that remain strictly isolated from one another.This isolation creates a silo effect. An agent in one branch cannot access the data, tools, or workflows discovered by an agent in a parallel branch. If a specific lineage fails to be selected for the next generation, any valuable discovery made by that agent, such as a novel debugging tool or a more efficient testing workflow, dies out with it.In their paper, the researchers question the necessity of adhering to this biological metaphor. \"AI agents are not biological individuals,\" they argue. \"Why should their evolution remain constrained by biological paradigms?\"The collective intelligence of Group-Evolving AgentsGEA shifts the paradigm by treating a group of agents, rather than an individual, as the fundamental unit of evolution.The process begins by selecting a group of parent agents from an existing archive. To ensure a healthy mix of stability and innovation, GEA selects these agents based on a combined score of performance (competence in solving tasks) and novelty (how distinct their capabilities are from others).Unlike traditional systems where an agent only learns from its direct parent, GEA creates a shared pool of collective experience. This pool contains the evolutionary traces from all members of the parent group, including code modifications, successful solutions to tasks, and tool invocation histories. Every agent in the group gains access to this collective history, allowing them to learn from the breakthroughs and mistakes of their peers.A “Reflection Module,” powered by a large language model, analyzes this collective history to identify group-wide patterns. For instance, if one agent discovers a high-performing debugging tool while another perfects a testing workflow, the system extracts both insights. Based on this analysis, the system generates high-level \"evolution directives\" that guide the creation of the child group. This ensures the next generation possesses the combined strengths of all their parents, rather than just the traits of a single lineage.However, this hive-mind approach works best when success is objective, such as in coding tasks. \"For less deterministic domains (e.g., creative generation), evaluation signals are weaker,\" Zhaotian Weng and Xin Eric Wang, co-authors of the paper, told VentureBeat in written comments. \"Blindly sharing outputs and experiences may introduce low-quality experiences that act as noise. This suggests the need for stronger experience filtering mechanisms\" for subjective tasks.GEA in actionThe researchers tested GEA against the current state-of-the-art self-evolving baseline, the Darwin Godel Machine (DGM), on two rigorous benchmarks. The results demonstrated a massive leap in capability without increasing the number of agents used.This collaborative approach also makes the system more robust against failure. In their experiments, the researchers intentionally broke agents by manually injecting bugs into their implementations. GEA was able to repair these critical bugs in an average of 1.4 iterations, while the baseline took 5 iterations. The system effectively leverages the \"healthy\" members of the group to diagnose and patch the compromised ones.On SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark consisting of real GitHub issues including bugs and feature requests, GEA achieved a 71.0% success rate, compared to the baseline&#x27;s 56.7%. This translates to a significant boost in autonomous engineering throughput, meaning the agents are far more capable of handling real-world software maintenance. Similarly, on Polyglot, which tests code generation across diverse programming languages, GEA achieved 88.3% against the baseline&#x27;s 68.3%, indicating high adaptability to different tech stacks.For enterprise R&D teams, the most critical finding is that GEA allows AI to design itself as effectively as human engineers. On SWE-bench, GEA’s 71.0% success rate effectively matches the performance of OpenHands, the top human-designed open-source framework. On Polyglot, GEA significantly outperformed Aider, a popular coding assistant, which achieved 52.0%. This suggests that organizations may eventually reduce their reliance on large teams of prompt engineers to tweak agent frameworks, as the agents can meta-learn these optimizations autonomously.This efficiency extends to cost management. \"GEA is explicitly a two-stage system: (1) agent evolution, then (2) inference/deployment,\" the researchers said. \"After evolution, you deploy a single evolved agent... so enterprise inference cost is essentially unchanged versus a standard single-agent setup.\"The success of GEA stems largely from its ability to consolidate improvements. The researchers tracked specific innovations invented by the agents during the evolutionary process. In the baseline approach, valuable tools often appeared in isolated branches but failed to propagate because those specific lineages ended. In GEA, the shared experience model ensured these tools were adopted by the best-performing agents. The top GEA agent integrated traits from 17 unique ancestors (representing 28% of the population) whereas the best baseline agent integrated traits from only 9. In effect, GEA creates a \"super-employee\" that possesses the combined best practices of the entire group.\"A GEA-inspired workflow in production would allow agents to first attempt a few independent fixes when failures occur,\" the researchers explained regarding this self-healing capability. \"A reflection agent (typically powered by a strong foundation model) can then summarize the outcomes... and guide a more comprehensive system update.\"Furthermore, the improvements discovered by GEA are not tied to a specific underlying model. Agents evolved using one model, such as Claude, maintained their performance gains even when the underlying engine was swapped to another model family, such as GPT-5.1 or GPT-o3-mini. This transferability offers enterprises the flexibility to switch model providers without losing the custom architectural optimizations their agents have learned.For industries with strict compliance requirements, the idea of self-modifying code might sound risky. To address this, the authors said: \"We expect enterprise deployments to include non-evolvable guardrails, such as sandboxed execution, policy constraints, and verification layers.\"While the researchers plan to release the official code soon, developers can already begin implementing the GEA architecture conceptually on top of existing agent frameworks. The system requires three key additions to a standard agent stack: an “experience archive” to store evolutionary traces, a “reflection module” to analyze group patterns, and an “updating module” that allows the agent to modify its own code based on those insights.Looking ahead, the framework could democratize advanced agent development. \"One promising direction is hybrid evolution pipelines,\" the researchers said, \"where smaller models explore early to accumulate diverse experiences, and stronger models later guide evolution using those experiences.\"",

          "standfirst": "The Winter Olympics have been a blast so far, and there are still four days left. It's the perfect time to get ahold of a virtual private network (VPN) and check out how the games are broadcast in other countries— all while improving your cybersecurity. By connecting to a VPN every time you get online, you can keep your activity hidden from your ISP and anyone to whom it may sell that data, while streaming sports and TV from across the globe. We strongly recommend using a VPN, but shopping for one takes some care. If you jump on the very first deal you see, you might get stuck with a substandard app. It's also easy to end up paying more than you meant to, since otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be. Even with all those conditions, there are some great bargains on the table. Many of the best VPNs — including our top pick, Proton VPN — have deals that save you anywhere from 70 to 87 percent on annual subscriptions. Most of the Valentine's Day sales have ended, but there are still plenty of chances to save money. Best VPN deals ExpressVPN Basic — $68.40 for a two-year subscription with four months free (81 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This discount, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 81 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price. ExpressVPN Advanced — $88.00 for a two-year subscription with four months free (77 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. As above, note that it renews at $119.95 annually. NordVPN Basic — $81.36 for a two-year subscription (70 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. NordVPN includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This deal gives you 70 percent off the two-year plan, but note that it renews at $139.08 per year. NordVPN Plus — $93.36 for a two-year subscription (74 percent off): NordVPN has taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. When this plan renews, you'll be paying $179.88 per year. Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark One — $61.83 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with four months free (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 28 months of CyberGhost for 79 percent off the usual price, but it'll renew at $56.94 per year. hide.me — $69.99 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. It also comes with a guarantee that it'll renew at exactly the same length and pricing. Windscribe — $69 for a one-year subscription (32 percent off): It's not nearly as steep a discount as some of the others on this list, but Windscribe was cheap to begin with, so 32 percent off its monthly price is a bigger savings than it might seem. As I just covered in a detailed Windscribe review, it's worth upgrading from the free service to get full access to Windscribe's all-real server network (and remove the free plan's data cap). Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. You can also get a shorter one-year subscription for $40 ($3.33 per month). Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. What makes a good VPN deal Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

NordVPN Plus — $93.36 for a two-year subscription (74 percent off): NordVPN has taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. When this plan renews, you'll be paying $179.88 per year. Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark One — $61.83 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with four months free (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 28 months of CyberGhost for 79 percent off the usual price, but it'll renew at $56.94 per year. hide.me — $69.99 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. It also comes with a guarantee that it'll renew at exactly the same length and pricing. Windscribe — $69 for a one-year subscription (32 percent off): It's not nearly as steep a discount as some of the others on this list, but Windscribe was cheap to begin with, so 32 percent off its monthly price is a bigger savings than it might seem. As I just covered in a detailed Windscribe review, it's worth upgrading from the free service to get full access to Windscribe's all-real server network (and remove the free plan's data cap). Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. You can also get a shorter one-year subscription for $40 ($3.33 per month). Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. What makes a good VPN deal Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

          "standfirst": "Alibaba dropped Qwen3.5 earlier this week, timed to coincide with the Lunar New Year, and the headline numbers alone are enough to make enterprise AI buyers stop and pay attention.The new flagship open-weight model — Qwen3.5-397B-A17B — packs 397 billion total parameters but activates only 17 billion per token. It is claiming benchmark wins against Alibaba&#x27;s own previous flagship, Qwen3-Max, a model the company itself has acknowledged exceeded one trillion parameters. The release marks a meaningful moment in enterprise AI procurement. For IT leaders evaluating AI infrastructure for 2026, Qwen 3.5 presents a different kind of argument: that the model you can actually run, own, and control can now trade blows with the models you have to rent.A New Architecture Built for Speed at ScaleThe engineering story underneath Qwen3.5 starts with its ancestry. The model is a direct successor to last September&#x27;s experimental Qwen3-Next, an ultra-sparse MoE model that was previewed but widely regarded as half-trained. Qwen3.5 takes that architectural direction and scales it aggressively, jumping from 128 experts in the previous Qwen3 MoE models to 512 experts in the new release.The practical implication of this and a better attention mechanism is dramatically lower inference latency. Because only 17 billion of those 397 billion parameters are active for any given forward pass, the compute footprint is far closer to a 17B dense model than a 400B one — while the model can draw on the full depth of its expert pool for specialized reasoning.These speed gains are substantial. At 256K context lengths, Qwen 3.5 decodes 19 times faster than Qwen3-Max and 7.2 times faster than Qwen 3&#x27;s 235B-A22B model. Alibaba is also claiming the model is 60% cheaper to run than its predecessor and eight times more capable of handling large concurrent workloads, figures that matter enormously to any team paying attention to inference bills. It&#x27;s also about 1/18th the cost of Google&#x27;s Gemini 3 Pro.Two other architectural decisions compound these gains:Qwen3.5 adopts multi-token prediction — an approach pioneered in several proprietary models — which accelerates pre-training convergence and increases throughput. It also inherits the attention system from Qwen3-Next released last year, designed specifically to reduce memory pressure at very long context lengths. The result is a model that can comfortably operate within a 256K context window in the open-weight version, and up to 1 million tokens in the hosted Qwen3.5-Plus variant on Alibaba Cloud Model Studio.Native Multimodal, Not Bolted OnFor years, Alibaba took the standard industry approach: build a language model, then attach a vision encoder to create a separate VL variant. Qwen3.5 abandons that pattern entirely. The model is trained from scratch on text, images, and video simultaneously, meaning visual reasoning is woven into the model&#x27;s core representations rather than grafted on.This matters in practice. Natively multimodal models tend to outperform their adapter-based counterparts on tasks that require tight text-image reasoning — think analyzing a technical diagram alongside its documentation, processing UI screenshots for agentic tasks, or extracting structured data from complex visual layouts. On MathVista, the model scores 90.3; on MMMU, 85.0. It trails Gemini 3 on several vision-specific benchmarks but surpasses Claude Opus 4.5 on multimodal tasks and posts competitive numbers against GPT-5.2, all while carrying a fraction of the parameter count.Qwen3.5&#x27;s benchmark performance against larger proprietary models is the number that will drive enterprise conversations. On the evaluations Alibaba has published, the 397B-A17B model outperforms Qwen3-Max — a model with over a trillion parameters — across multiple reasoning and coding tasks. It also claims competitive results against GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro on general reasoning and coding benchmarks.Language Coverage and Tokenizer EfficiencyOne underappreciated detail in the Qwen3.5 release is its expanded multilingual reach. The model&#x27;s vocabulary has grown to 250k tokens, up from 150k in prior Qwen generations and now comparable to Google&#x27;s ~256K tokenizer. Language support expands from 119 languages in Qwen 3 to 201 languages and dialects.The tokenizer upgrade has direct cost implications for global deployments. Larger vocabularies encode non-Latin scripts — Arabic, Thai, Korean, Japanese, Hindi, and others — more efficiently, reducing token counts by 15–40% depending on the language. For IT organizations running AI at scale across multilingual user bases, this is not an academic detail. It translates directly to lower inference costs and faster response times.Agentic Capabilities and the OpenClaw IntegrationAlibaba is positioning Qwen3.5 explicitly as an agentic model — one designed not just to respond to queries but to take multi-step autonomous action on behalf of users and systems. The company has open-sourced Qwen Code, a command-line interface that lets developers delegate complex coding tasks to the model in natural language, roughly analogous to Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Code.The release also highlights compatibility with OpenClaw, the open-source agentic framework that has surged in developer adoption this year. With 15,000 distinct reinforcement learning training environments used to sharpen the model&#x27;s reasoning and task execution, the Qwen team has made a deliberate bet on RL-based training to improve practical agentic performance — a trend consistent with what MiniMax demonstrated with M2.5.The Qwen3.5-Plus hosted variant also enables adaptive inference modes: a fast mode for latency-sensitive applications, a thinking mode that enables extended chain-of-thought reasoning for complex tasks, and an auto (adaptive) mode that selects dynamically. That flexibility matters for enterprise deployments where the same model may need to serve both real-time customer interactions and deep analytical workflows.Deployment Realities: What IT Teams Actually Need to KnowRunning Qwen3.5’s open-weights in-house requires serious hardware. While a quantized version demands approximately 256GB of RAM, and realistically 512GB for comfortable headroom. This is not a model for a workstation or a modest on-prem server. What it is suitable for is a GPU node — a configuration that many enterprises already operate for inference workloads, and one that now offers a compelling alternative to API-dependent deployments.All open-weight Qwen 3.5 models are released under the Apache 2.0 license. This is a meaningful distinction from models with custom or restricted licenses: Apache 2.0 allows commercial use, modification, and redistribution without royalties, with no meaningful strings attached. For legal and procurement teams evaluating open models, that clean licensing posture simplifies the conversation considerably.What Comes NextAlibaba has confirmed this is the first release in the Qwen3.5 family, not the complete rollout. Based on the pattern from Qwen3 — which featured models down to 600 million parameters — the industry expects smaller dense distilled models and additional MoE configurations to follow over the next several weeks and months. The Qwen3-Next 80B model from last September was widely considered undertrained, suggesting a 3.5 variant at that scale is a likely near-term release.For IT decision-makers, the trajectory is clear. Alibaba has demonstrated that open-weight models at the frontier are no longer a compromise. Qwen3.5 is a genuine procurement option for teams that want frontier-class reasoning, native multimodal capabilities, and a 1M token context window — without locking into a proprietary API. The next question is not whether this family of models is capable enough. It is whether your infrastructure and team are ready to take advantage of it.Qwen 3.5 is available now on Hugging Face under the model ID Qwen/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B. The hosted Qwen3.5-Plus variant is available via Alibaba Cloud Model Studio. Qwen Chat at chat.qwen.ai offers free public access for evaluation.",

          "standfirst": "Apple has scheduled a product launch event, dubbed an \"Apple Experience\", for March 4 at 9AM ET. The company is reportedly holding this event in NYC, London and Shanghai. Everyone loves shiny new products, so what can we expect to see at Apple's first launch event of 2026? We don't know anything for certain, but we have plenty of educated guesses that have been sourced from industry reports and speculation from analysts. Budget-Friendly MacBook There have been rumors swirling that Apple is preparing to launch a cheaper alternative to the MacBook Air. Bloomberg reported on this all the way back in November. Industry rumors indicate that Apple will be stuffing this laptop with an iPhone processor, the A18 Pro, to keep the price down. Worth pointing out the three colors from the invite are light green, blue and yellow -- which just so happen to be the colors Apple has tested the low-cost MacBook with, as I wrote yesterday. Coincidence? We shall see. https://t.co/1FFVkfw9JZ pic.twitter.com/ssKDDzdJsw— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) February 16, 2026 It's also been suggested that this laptop will only include 8GB of RAM, which kind of flies against the company's recent stance to outfit all Macs with at least 16GB of RAM. However, that would certainly help with the cost. You might have heard about a little thing called AI that chomp chomps on all RAM it can find. TechRadar has reported that this could be Apple's biggest laptop launch in years, with potential initial shipments hitting 8 million units. The price is likely to be somewhere in the $699 to $799 range, which is pretty nifty. However, I'd still go for an Air at $999. They are absolute workhorses. MacBook Pro with M5 Pro and Max chips It's likely that Apple will release more powerful MacBook Pro models this year and the timing seems to match up. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has suggested a March launch and the event is on March 4. The company has already released a MacBook Pro with an M5 chip, but both the M5 Pro and Max are likely on the horizon. We could be getting new laptops outfitted with these chips in various display sizes. Devindra Hardawar for Engadget There have also been reports that both of the higher-end M5 chips are getting a redesign to help improve heat dissipation and reduce defective chip rates. Additionally, the new chiplet design would allow the M5 Pro and Max to raise the total number of CPU and GPU cores. The Max is expected to have more cores than the Pro. This idea is helped along by the fact that MacBook Pro M4 Max orders are currently delayed. This is typically the case with an outgoing model as stock dries up to make room for new releases. Also, the Pro and Max variants typically get announced in the Fall, so we are due. New iPads Rumors have been circulating that we are about to get new iPads, including an update to the base model and the Air. The standard model, which would be the 12th-gen release, is expected to upgrade the A16 chip to an A18. This should also allow for the integration of Apple Intelligence tools, if that's your bag. Nathan Ingraham for Engadget As for that iPad Air, rumors suggest an upgrade to the M4 chip from the M3. An extremely light tablet with an M4 would be fairly notable in my estimation, as only the newest iPad Pro has that chip. iPhone 17e It was almost exactly a year ago that Apple announced the iPhone 16e, so you know what that means. It's time for a refresh. Recent reports have suggested that an announcement regarding the iPhone 17e is imminent, so this launch event seems like as good a place as any to reveal the latest \"budget-friendly\" smartphone. As for specs, Mark Gurman has suggested that it'll be getting an upgrade to the A19 chip, which is nice. Also, it could be getting MagSafe support. That sounds like an iterative upgrade, but the price is expected to remain steady at $599. Other Possibilities The following stuff is less likely, though certainly possible. There have been rumors that Apple is currently preparing a revamped Studio Display and Mac Studio desktop. The reports suggest a release sometime in the first half of the year, and March is right in the middle of that timeframe. It's also possible that the company will reveal an upgrade to the MacBook Air with the M5 chip. Reports indicate that this is unlikely to happen during this event, but it is worth noting that the M4 Air came out in March of last year. In other words, it's a toss up. The inclusion of Shanghai essentially rules out Siri, as expected, given the delays. https://t.co/mgNLR4qCYy— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) February 16, 2026 What's not a toss up? You shouldn't expect anything regarding the long-anticipated Siri refresh. This looks to be a hardware event, so any software updates will likely have to wait until WWDC this summer. In any event, Engadget will be on hand to report on all of Apple's new products.

          "standfirst": "Typically, when building, training and deploying AI, enterprises prioritize accuracy. And that, no doubt, is important; but in highly complex, nuanced industries like law, accuracy alone isn’t enough. Higher stakes mean higher standards: Models outputs must be assessed for relevancy, authority, citation accuracy and hallucination rates. To tackle this immense task, LexisNexis has evolved beyond standard retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to graph RAG and agentic graphs; it has also built out \"planner\" and \"reflection\" AI agents that parse requests and criticize their own outputs. “There’s no such [thing] as ‘perfect AI’ because you never get 100% accuracy or 100% relevancy, especially in complex, high stake domains like legal,” Min Chen, LexisNexis&#x27; SVP and chief AI officer, acknowledges in a new VentureBeat Beyond the Pilot podcast. The goal is to manage that uncertainty as much as possible and translate it into consistent customer value. “At the end of the day, what matters most for us is the quality of the AI outcome, and that is a continuous journey of experimentation, iteration and improvement,” Chen said. Getting ‘complete’ answers to multi-faceted questionsTo evaluate models and their outputs, Chen’s team has established more than a half-dozen “sub metrics” to measure “usefulness” based on several factors — authority, citation accuracy, hallucination rates — as well as “comprehensiveness.” This particular metric is designed to evaluate whether a gen AI response fully addressed all aspects of a users&#x27; legal questions. “So it&#x27;s not just about relevancy,” Chen said. “Completeness speaks directly to legal reliability.”For instance, a user may ask a question that requires an answer covering five distinct legal considerations. Gen AI may provide a response that accurately addresses three of these. But, while relevant, this partial answer is incomplete and, from a user perspective, insufficient. This can be misleading and pose real-life risks.Or, for example, some citations may be semantically relevant to a user&#x27;s question, but they may point to arguments or instances that were ultimately overruled in court. “Our lawyers will consider them not citable,” Chen said. “If they&#x27;re not citable, they&#x27;re not useful.”Moving beyond standard RAGLexisNexis launched its flagship gen AI product, Lexis+ AI — a legal AI tool for drafting, research and analysis — in 2023. It was built on a standard RAG framework and hybrid vector search that grounds responses in LexisNexis&#x27; trusted, authoritative knowledge base. The company then released its personal legal assistant, Protégé, in 2024. This agent incorporates a knowledge graph layer on top of vector search to overcome a “key limitation” of pure semantic search. Although “very good” at retrieving contextually relevant content, semantic search “doesn&#x27;t always guarantee authoritative answers,\" Chen said.Initial semantic search returns what it deems relevant content; Chen’s team then traverses those returns across a “point of law” graph to further filter the most highly authoritative documents. Going beyond this, Chen&#x27;s team is developing agentic graphs and accelerating automation so agents can plan and execute complex multi-step tasks. For instance, self-directed “planner agents” for research Q&A break user questions into multiple sub-questions. Human users can review and edit these to further refine and personalize final answers. Meanwhile, a “reflection agent” handles transactional document drafting. It can “automatically, dynamically” criticize its initial draft, then incorporate that feedback and refine in real time. However, Chen said that all of this is not to cut humans out of the mix; human experts and AI agents can “learn, reason and grow together.” “I see the future [as] a deeper collaboration between humans and AI.”Watch the podcast to hear more about: How LexisNexis’ acquisition of Henchman helped ground AI models with proprietary LexisNexis data and customer data; The difference between deterministic and non-deterministic evaluation; Why enterprises should identify KPIs and definitions of success before rushing to experimentation;The importance of focusing on a “triangle” of key components: Cost, speed and quality.You can also listen and subscribe to Beyond the Pilot on Spotify, Apple or wherever you get your podcasts.",

          "title": "Google Pixel 10a vs. Pixel 9a: What's changed and which one should you buy?",
          "standfirst": "Now that pre-orders are open for the Google Pixel 10a, it’s time to see how it stacks up against last year’s Pixel 9a. At first glance, the two phones look very similar, and that’s not a bad thing. Google hasn’t tried to reinvent its budget-friendly formula this year, sticking to the same compact design, clean software experience and camera-first approach that made the 9a such a good value.Both phones share a lot in common, including 120Hz OLED displays, Google’s Tensor G4 chip, strong computational photography and seven years of OS and security updates. The actual differences are more incremental, including a moderately brighter, tougher display, improved Extreme Battery Saver longevity, slightly faster wireless charging and the addition of Satellite SOS. Importantly, Google is keeping the starting price the same as before, with both phones coming in at $499.On paper, the Pixel 10a doesn’t dramatically rethink what an affordable Pixel should be, but it does offer meaningful upgrades for the same price. While we wait for a review unit to evaluate the Pixel 10a's day-to-day performance, here's a quick comparison of the spec sheets of the two devices to see what the new model brings.Pixel 10a vs Pixel 9a: Design and displayThere’s very little separating these two on performance. Both the Pixel 9a and Pixel 10a run Google’s Tensor G4 chip with 8GB of RAM and the same storage options, so day-to-day speed should feel virtually identical. The Pixel 10a ships with Android 16 out of the box, though the 9a can be updated to the same version.Off the bat, the Pixel 10a doesn’t look dramatically different from the Pixel 9a, and that appears to be intentional. Google is sticking with the same compact, no-frills approach from the last few A-series Pixels, so you’re still getting a 6.3-inch OLED panel with a smooth 60–120Hz refresh rate and a clean, understated aesthetic. The meaningful changes show up once you dig into the display specs. The Pixel 10a upgrades the cover glass from Corning Gorilla Glass 3 to Gorilla Glass 7i, which should offer better durability against drops and scratches over time. Brightness also gets a noticeable bump. The 9a topped out at 1,800 nits for HDR content and 2,700 nits at peak, while the 10a pushes that to 2,000 nits for HDR and up to 3,000 nits at peak brightness. In practice, that should make the Pixel 10a easier to read outdoors and a bit punchier when watching HDR video.Contrast is improved as well. The Pixel 10a’s panel is rated at a contrast ratio of more than 2,000,000:1, doubling the already respectable figure on the Pixel 9a. That won’t radically change how the phone looks day to day, but it should translate to deeper blacks and slightly more depth in darker scenes, especially when streaming video or browsing photos at night.Pixel 10a vs Pixel 9a: CamerasOn paper, the Pixel 10a’s camera hardware looks very familiar. Like the Pixel 9a, it uses a 48-megapixel main camera paired with a 13MP ultra-wide, and there’s no dedicated telephoto lens. Image quality, color science and low-light performance should therefore be similar between the two.Where the Pixel 10a pulls ahead is in software features. Google has added a few camera tools that aren’t available on the Pixel 9a, even though the underlying hardware hasn’t changed much. One of those is Camera Coach, which debuted on last year’s Pixel 10 series and offers on-screen tips to help you frame shots better or adjust how you’re holding the phone. The Pixel 10a also gains Macro Focus, allowing you to get much closer to small subjects like plants or textures. In our Pixel 9a review, we found the phone could capture solid close-up detail, but locking focus could be finicky at times, so a more dedicated macro mode should make those shots easier to nail.Finally, there’s Auto Best Take, which automatically picks the best expressions from a burst of photos and combines them into a single image. The feature debuted on Google’s Pixel 10 lineup last year, and it’s especially handy for group shots where someone always seems to blink at the wrong moment. By bringing it to the 10a, Google is extending one of its more genuinely practical AI camera tricks to a cheaper phone.Battery life and chargingBoth the Pixel 9a and Pixel 10a use a 5,100mAh battery and support the same 23W wired charging speeds. Where the Pixel 10a does pull ahead slightly is wireless charging. The Pixel 9a tops out at 7.5W, while the Pixel 10a supports wireless charging at up to 10W when used with Qi-certified Extended Power Profile (EPP) chargers, which are designed to deliver faster wireless power than basic Qi pads. The difference isn’t dramatic, but the Pixel 10a should charge a bit quicker on a compatible wireless stand when you’re in a pinch.You’ll also get some extra hours in dire situations. When you activate Extreme Battery Saver, the Pixel 9a is rated for up to 100 hours, while the Pixel 10a extends that to up to 120 hours. The Pixel 10a gets Satellite SOSThe biggest safety-related upgrade on the Pixel 10a is the addition of Satellite SOS. Because it uses a newer modem compared to the Pixel 9a’s Exynos Modem 5300, it is capable of tapping satellite networks when necessary. This allows the phone to contact emergency services when you’re outside of cellular or Wi-Fi coverage, which can be genuinely useful if you spend time hiking, traveling or driving in remote areas.If you already own a Pixel 9a, there doesn’t appear to be a huge reason to upgrade. Day-to-day performance may feel almost identical, since both phones use the same Tensor G4 chip, the same amount of RAM and very similar camera hardware.That said, the Pixel 10a does make a stronger case for first-time buyers or anyone upgrading from an older Pixel. The biggest differentiator, though, is Satellite SOS — it’s the one feature the Pixel 9a simply can’t match due to hardware limitations. At the same $499 starting price, the Pixel 10a is, on paper, the better long-term buy if you’re choosing between the two today.

Although it's the new 2026 addition to the A series lineup, the Pixel 10a invites many comparisons with last year's Pixel 9a. For starters, the price is identical at $499. Design-wise, not much as changed. The back of the phone can lay flat, which has become a hallmark of the Pixel A collection, rather than wobbling around on a bulky camera housing. The screen is still 6.3 inches with an Actua display. The phone's insides are also the same; the 10a comes with the same Tensor G4 chip and 8GB of RAM as its predecessor, and buyers have the option to upgrade to either 128GB or 256GB of storage. The phone has an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance and its display uses Corning Gorilla Glass 7i. One of the few areas where the 10a is getting a marked upgrade is on its battery. This version claims more than 30 hours of battery life, or up to 120 under the Extra Battery Saver mode. The 10a also brings the welcome addition of proper fast charging, where a compatible charger can get the device to 50 percent battery in about 30 minutes. This addresses one of the few complaints we had about the 9a. For the photo buffs, the Pixel 10a has a 48MP main camera and a 13MP ultrawide lens; again unchanged from the specs in the 9a. AI is also present in the new model's photography suite, with the addition of the Camera Coach resource for the first time on the A series lineup. Camera Coach uses Gemini AI models to read the scene and offer tips on getting the desired shot. The 10a also has the Auto Best Take feature for getting everyone's best side in a group shot and the Add Me tool that lets you insert yourself into a photo after the fact.

          "standfirst": "Google's A-series phones have offered some of the best value among midrange handsets for years, and after checking out the new Pixel 10a, I don't see that trend stopping anytime soon.Let's start with the specs. Starting at just $499, you get a vivid 6.3-inch OLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and 3,000 nits of peak brightness, 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of onboard storage. The phone also features a durable aluminum frame along with a stronger Corning Gorilla Glass 7i panel in front and a composite plastic back with a lovely matte finish. As a nod towards sustainability, Google says the P10a's chassis is made from 100 percent recycled material, while the rear panel comes in at 81 percent. And just like its predecessor, you still get an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance and the same battery capacity (5,100mAh) — except now it charges even faster, both wired (30 watts, up from 23) and wirelessly (10 watts, up from 5).While lavender is the new hero color for the Pixel 10a, berry is the hue I'd pick. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetThe one place where the Pixel 10a might come up a touch short is that unlike its more expensive siblings, it features an older Tensor G4 processor instead of the Tensor G5 chip used on the main Pixel 10 line. Google says the decision to go with an older SoC is due to budget constraints. While it might not be the first choice for gamers or power users, I've never really had an issue with the day-to-day performance of Google's recent homegrown silicon.However, even with a one-year-old chip, Google found a way to port over three flagship features to the Pixel A series for the first time. Camera Coach uses AI to help you compose and come up with more interesting shots. Meanwhile, Auto Best Take is designed to ensure that everyone in a group shot ends up with their finest expression. Finally, Satellite SOS allows you to call for help during emergencies, even when you don't have proper cell service. Satellite SOS support is one of three new features coming to the Google's A-series phones for the first time. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetAs for its cameras, the P10a looks to be using the same sensors as before, including a 48MP main camera, a 13MP ultra-wide and a 13MP selfie shooter in front. That might be a bummer for some, but considering that the Pixel 9a offered by far the best image quality of any phone in its price bracket, I'm not that bothered. Also, it's quite likely that if Google had opted for new hardware, it may have pushed the phone above $500. After seeing the positive response to the barely-there camera bump on its predecessor, Google leaned in and made the Pixel 10a’s rear camera module completely flat, and it’s my favorite thing about the phone. There's no hump or protrusions to speak of, and when combined with the rest of the phone's design, it results in a really sleek, minimalist look. Plus, after almost a decade of big and bulky camera warts on the back of phones, it's just nice seeing the Pixel 10a go the opposite direction. I really appreciate how Google double downed on feedback regarding the Pixel 9a's tiny camera bump (left) by making the Pixel 10a's camera (right) completely flat. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetOn the flipside, my biggest complaint about the P10a is that Google didn't include Pixelsnap support (aka magnetic Qi2 compatibility). It's another feature that got cut due to cost and it's a real bummer because after introducing it on last year's main Pixel 10 line, I was hoping that it would become a standard inclusion on all Google phones going forward. Thankfully, when I asked about the lack of Pixelsnap support, Google representatives were able to confirm that there will be third-party accessory makers such as Casefinite, Dbrand and Spigen that will offer cases with built-in magnetic rings, so anyone hoping to attach magnetic peripherals will still have an avenue to do so. The Pixel 10a's charging speeds have been improved to 30 watts for wired and 10 watts wirelessly. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetRegardless, for Android phone owners who are in the market for a simple, no-nonsense upgrade that covers all the basics without breaking the bank, the Pixel 10a is looking like another top contender. The Pixel 10a is available for pre-order today in lavender, berry, fog and obsidian with official sales slated for March 5.

For the Complete tier, the deal brings the total cost down to $130 for 24 months. NordVPN regularly appears on Engadget’s list of the best VPN services thanks to its wide server network, strong security tools and consistent performance across devices. NordVPN’s latest promotion puts one of its most comprehensive plans at a price that undercuts many competing premium VPN subscriptions. The Complete tier includes full access to NordVPN’s core VPN service, which encrypts internet traffic and masks a user’s IP address to help protect online activity on public Wi-Fi networks and at home. Subscribers can use the service on multiple devices, including phones, tablets, laptops and smart TVs, with apps available for major operating systems. It also includes access to NordPass (more on that below), an ad blocker and 1TB of cloud storage. You’ll find similar discounts on all of NordVPN’s other plans: Basic, Plus and Prime. Beyond the basics, NordVPN offers features like threat protection to help block malicious websites and trackers, as well as specialty servers designed for added privacy or faster performance in specific scenarios. In our NordVPN review, the service was praised for its evolving feature set and overall reliability, even as the VPN market becomes increasingly competitive. Engadget regularly tracks VPN pricing trends and this offer compares favorably with other current promotions. It also appears alongside NordVPN deals featured in Engadget’s ongoing roundup of the best VPN discounts available right now, which compares offers from multiple major providers. Those looking for additional security tools may also want to note that NordVPN’s Complete plan bundles in extra services beyond the VPN itself. One of those is NordPass, the company’s password management app. NordPass is also discounted as part of a separate promotion, if you’re primarily looking for a password manager rather than a VPN. The Premium tier is currently 50 percent off, bringing the price down to $36 for two years. NordPass Premium adds features such as cross-device password syncing, secure password sharing and breach monitoring, which alerts users if stored credentials appear in known data leaks. Both offers are available for a limited time, though Nord has not specified an end date for the promotion. If you’re still unsure whether NordVPN is right for you, it offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can change your mind and get a full refund.

The best wireless headphones make it easier to focus on your workout, but not every pair is built to handle sweat, motion and long sessions.Fitness-focused headphones put different demands on design and performance. Secure fit, water resistance and dependable battery life matter just as much as sound quality, especially if you plan to use them outside the gym as well. Some are tuned for awareness during outdoor runs, while others aim to block distractions during intense training.We’ve tested a wide range of wireless headphones and wireless earbuds that are suited for exercise, narrowing the list down to options that hold up during workouts and still work well for everyday listening. Below, you’ll find our top picks, along with guidance to help you choose the right pair for how you train. Best workout headphones for 2026 Others wireless workout headphones we tested Apple AirPods Pro 3 When it comes to running and working out, the edge that the AirPods Pro 3 have over the Pro 2, or even the top picks on our list, is built-in heart rate monitoring. That means you could go out with just your Pro 3 earbuds and your iPhone and still get heart rate information for your entire training session. But otherwise, the Pro 3 buds are just as capable as the Pro 2 when it comes to exercise. Some may prefer the soft-touch finish on our top picks to the AirPods' slick texture. Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 The Powerbeats Pro 2 are a good alternative to the Beats Fit Pro if you’re a stickler for a hook design. However, they cost $50 more than the Powerbeats Fit, and the main added advantage here is built-in heart rate sensors. Anker Soundcore AeroFit Pro The Soundcore AeroFit Pro is Anker’s version of the Shokz OpenFit, but I found the fit to be less secure and not as comfortable. The actual earbuds on the AeroFit Pro are noticeably bulkier than those on the OpenFit and that caused them to shift and move much more during exercise. They never fell off of my ears completely, but I spent more time adjusting them than I did enjoying them. JBL Endurance Peak 3 The most noteworthy thing about the Endurance Peak 3 is that they have the same IP68 rating as the Jabra Elite 8 Active, except they only cost $100. But, while you get the same protection here, you’ll have to sacrifice in other areas. The Endurance Peak 3 didn’t blow me away when it came to sound quality or comfort (its hook is more rigid than those on my favorite similarly designed buds) and their charging case is massive compared to most competitors. What to look for in workout headphones Design Before diving in, it’s worth mentioning that this guide focuses on wireless earbuds. While you could wear over-ear or on-ear headphones during a workout, most of the best headphones available now do not have the same level of durability. Water and dust resistance, particularly the former, is important for any audio gear you plan on sweating with or taking outdoors, and that’s more prevalent in the wireless earbuds world. Most earbuds have one of three designs: in-ear, in-ear with hook or open-ear. The first two are the most popular. In-ears are arguably the most common, while those with hooks promise better security and fit since they have an appendage that curls around the top of your ear. Open-ear designs don’t stick into your ear canal, but rather sit just outside of it. This makes it easier to hear the world around you while also listening to audio, and could be more comfortable for those who don’t like the intrusiveness of in-ear buds. Water resistance and dust protection Even if a pair of headphones for working out aren’t marketed specifically as exercise headphones, a sturdy, water-resistant design will, by default, make them suitable for exercise. To avoid repetition, here’s a quick primer on durability, or ingression protection (IP) ratings. The first digit you’ll see after the “IP” refers to protection from dust and other potential intrusions, measured on a scale from 1 to 6. The second refers to water resistance or even waterproofing, in the best cases. The ratings for water resistance are ranked on a scale of 1 to 9; higher numbers mean more protection, while the letter “X” means the device is not rated for protection in that regard. All of the earbuds we tested for this guide have at least an IPX4 rating, which means there’s no dust protection, but the buds can withstand splashes from any direction and are sweat resistant, but probably shouldn't be submerged. For a detailed breakdown of all the possible permutations, check out this guide published by a supplier called The Enclosure Company. Active noise cancellation and transparency mode Active noise cancellation (ANC) is becoming standard on wireless earbuds, at least those above a certain price point. If you’re looking for a pair of buds that can be your workout companion and serve you outside of the gym, too, noise cancelation is a good feature to have. It makes the buds more versatile, allowing you to block out the dull roar of your home or office so you can focus, or give you some solitude during a busy commute. But an earbud’s ability to block out the world goes hand-in-hand with its ability to open things back up should you need it. Many ANC earbuds also support some sort of “transparency mode,” or various levels of noise reduction. This is important for running headphones because exercising outdoors, alongside busy streets, can be dangerous. You probably don’t want to be totally oblivious to what’s going on around you when you’re running outside; adjusting noise cancelation levels to increase your awareness will help with that. Stronger noise cancelation might be more appealing to those doing more indoor training if they want to block out the dull roar of a gym or the guy exaggeratingly lifting weights next to you. Battery life All of the Bluetooth earbuds we tested have a battery life of six to eight hours. In general, that’s what you can expect from this space, with a few outliers that can get up to 15 hours of life on a charge. Even the low end of the spectrum should be good enough for most athletes and gym junkies, but it’ll be handy to keep the buds’ charging case on you if you think you’ll get close to using up all their juice during a single session. You’ll get an average of 20 to 28 extra hours of battery out of most charging cases and all of the earbuds we tested had holders that provided at least an extra 15 hours. This will dictate how often you actually have to charge the device — as in physically connect the case with earbuds inside to a charging cable, or set it on a wireless charger to power up. How we test workout headphones In testing wireless workout headphones, I wear them during every bit of exercise I do — be it a casual walk around the block, a brisk morning run or a challenging weight-lifting session. I’m looking for comfort arguably most of all, because you should never be fussing with your earbuds when you should be focusing on working out. In the same vein, I’m cognizant of if they get loose during fast movements or slippery when I’m sweating. I also use the earbuds when not exercising to take calls and listen to music throughout the day. Many people will want just one pair of earbuds that they can use while exercising and just doing everyday things, so I evaluate each pair on their ability to be comfortable and provide a good listening experience in multiple different activities. While I am also evaluating sound quality, I’m admittedly not an audio expert. My colleague Billy Steele holds that title at Engadget, and you’ll find much more detailed information about audio quality for some of our top picks in his reviews and buying guides. With these headphones for working out, however, I will make note of related issues if they stood out (i.e. if a pair of earbuds had noticeably strong bass out of the box, weak highs, etc). Most of the wireless workout headphones we tested work with companion apps that have adjustable EQ settings, so you’ll be able to tweak sound profiles to your liking in most cases.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-workout-headphones-191517835.html?src=rss",

The ratings for water resistance are ranked on a scale of 1 to 9; higher numbers mean more protection, while the letter “X” means the device is not rated for protection in that regard. All of the earbuds we tested for this guide have at least an IPX4 rating, which means there’s no dust protection, but the buds can withstand splashes from any direction and are sweat resistant, but probably shouldn't be submerged. For a detailed breakdown of all the possible permutations, check out this guide published by a supplier called The Enclosure Company. Active noise cancellation and transparency mode Active noise cancellation (ANC) is becoming standard on wireless earbuds, at least those above a certain price point. If you’re looking for a pair of buds that can be your workout companion and serve you outside of the gym, too, noise cancelation is a good feature to have. It makes the buds more versatile, allowing you to block out the dull roar of your home or office so you can focus, or give you some solitude during a busy commute. But an earbud’s ability to block out the world goes hand-in-hand with its ability to open things back up should you need it. Many ANC earbuds also support some sort of “transparency mode,” or various levels of noise reduction. This is important for running headphones because exercising outdoors, alongside busy streets, can be dangerous. You probably don’t want to be totally oblivious to what’s going on around you when you’re running outside; adjusting noise cancelation levels to increase your awareness will help with that. Stronger noise cancelation might be more appealing to those doing more indoor training if they want to block out the dull roar of a gym or the guy exaggeratingly lifting weights next to you. Battery life All of the Bluetooth earbuds we tested have a battery life of six to eight hours. In general, that’s what you can expect from this space, with a few outliers that can get up to 15 hours of life on a charge. Even the low end of the spectrum should be good enough for most athletes and gym junkies, but it’ll be handy to keep the buds’ charging case on you if you think you’ll get close to using up all their juice during a single session. You’ll get an average of 20 to 28 extra hours of battery out of most charging cases and all of the earbuds we tested had holders that provided at least an extra 15 hours. This will dictate how often you actually have to charge the device — as in physically connect the case with earbuds inside to a charging cable, or set it on a wireless charger to power up. How we test workout headphones In testing wireless workout headphones, I wear them during every bit of exercise I do — be it a casual walk around the block, a brisk morning run or a challenging weight-lifting session. I’m looking for comfort arguably most of all, because you should never be fussing with your earbuds when you should be focusing on working out. In the same vein, I’m cognizant of if they get loose during fast movements or slippery when I’m sweating. I also use the earbuds when not exercising to take calls and listen to music throughout the day. Many people will want just one pair of earbuds that they can use while exercising and just doing everyday things, so I evaluate each pair on their ability to be comfortable and provide a good listening experience in multiple different activities. While I am also evaluating sound quality, I’m admittedly not an audio expert. My colleague Billy Steele holds that title at Engadget, and you’ll find much more detailed information about audio quality for some of our top picks in his reviews and buying guides. With these headphones for working out, however, I will make note of related issues if they stood out (i.e. if a pair of earbuds had noticeably strong bass out of the box, weak highs, etc). Most of the wireless workout headphones we tested work with companion apps that have adjustable EQ settings, so you’ll be able to tweak sound profiles to your liking in most cases.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-workout-headphones-191517835.html?src=rss",

Today’s models are compact, increasingly affordable and capable of capturing sharp aerial photos and video with minimal effort. Whether you’re curious about flying for the first time or looking to upgrade to a more advanced camera drone, the options available in 2026 are broader and more approachable than ever.Entry-level drones now offer features like GPS-assisted flight, return-to-home safety systems and automated shooting modes that take much of the stress out of learning to fly. Step up to more advanced models and you’ll find foldable designs that travel easily, longer flight times and stabilized 4K video that holds up well beyond social media clips.We’ve tested a range of drones to identify the best options across different skill levels and budgets. Whether your priority is learning the basics, capturing polished aerial footage or packing light for travel, these picks highlight the drones that offer the best balance of performance, reliability and ease of use. Best drones for 2026 What to look for in a drone Camera features For this guide, we're looking only at drones that are basically flying cameras, so you want the best video and photo features possible. Bigger devices like DJI’s Mavic 3 Pro or Air 3S carry relatively large sensors, offering superior camera quality for nighttime cityscapes or other low-light scenes. Smaller models like the Mini 4 Pro and HoverAir X1 Max use smaller camera sensors, so they aren’t as good in dim light. Field of view and minimum aperture are also important, with most drones typically having a wide-angle focal length, though a few others like the HoverAir X1 Max carry an ultrawide lens. Some models have multiple cameras including a wide and a zoom. As for aperture, lower numbers are better and allow for shooting in dim light. Most DJI models are solid in this regard, while the HoverAir models don’t perform as well. Video resolution and slow-mo are also essential camera capabilities. Most drones these days can shoot at 4K with a frame rate of at least 30 fps, though some offer 6K or even 8K at up to 30 fps. Higher-end models can shoot 4K at up to 120 fps, allowing you to slow down the action dramatically to create a cinematic look. Other noteworthy features include log or HDR video that supports higher dynamic range, particularly in bright and sunny conditions. Finally, the camera’s gimbal and stabilization are important factors to keep your footage looking as smooth as possible. Some drones have gimbals that can rotate the camera 90 degrees to give social media creators the maximum resolution for vertical formats. Drone features: Speed, range, safety, battery life and obstacle detection By and large, there are two types of camera drones to consider. The first are standard drones (usually with open propellers but not always) designed to fly outside and take scenic shots. Often there’s nothing to stop the props from striking skin or objects, so they can’t really be used indoors or around people. Some models like the DJI Neo and Flip have prop guards that better protect bystanders and property, as well as the drone itself. Then there's first-person-view (FPV) camera drones, which often have propeller guards and are meant to be used both indoors or outside to capture exciting footage. Standard models don’t need to go particularly fast as they’re mainly used to shoot fun videos for social media, but FPV drones need to move at high speeds to create excitement. Because of that speed, they’re also better in breezy conditions thanks to stronger wind resistance, and they can fight gusts and return home more quickly. Acrobatic abilities (often promoted by the manufacturer in ads or packaging) are also important for FPV drones, as it allows the user to perform tricks and zip around obstacles. Battery life is another important factor. The best drones boast a battery endurance of up to 45 minutes, while FPV drones like the Avata 2 can only fly for about half that time as they tend to be heavier and carry smaller batteries to reduce weight. As a general rule, a single battery isn’t enough for any serious shooting so you’d do well to buy your drone in a kit with a few batteries and a charger. As for range, DJI tends to dominate in this area, with its latest models able to maintain a video signal at a distance up to 20km (12.4 miles). HoverAir’s models are weaker with the top-end X1 Max model limited to just 1km (0.6 miles) when using the optional beacon system. DJI also offers multiple ways to control its drones including headsets, joystick-type controllers, motion detection controllers and smartphones. The best drones have sensors to detect obstacles in all directions. Others are limited to only avoiding obstructions coming at them from the front and some only rely on the main camera to prevent crashes. Finally, if you want to have your drone follow you around automatically, you’ll need it to be able to track you around when you’re vlogging, riding a bike or skiing, while also avoiding obstacles. Smooth takeoff and return-to-home features are especially valuable here for both beginners and experienced drone pilots as well. Best drone FAQs What are the rules for owning a drone? Anyone can buy any drone, but once purchased, all drones between 250g and 25 kg must be registered with the FAA and marked with the FAA registration number. Recreational pilots with drones over 249g must pass the recreational UAS safety \"TRUST\" exam and carry proof of TRUST completion when flying a drone. Commercial pilots must obtain a Remote Pilot Certificate from the FAA. You must be aware of and avoid any areas with airspace restrictions, particularly around airports. Are drones safe to fly in the city? In general, it is not legal to fly a drone within city limits over populations, as a crash from a high altitude could injure or kill someone. However, they can be flown over adjacent, non-populated areas in many cases. Here is a guide to where: https://uavcoach.com/where-to-fly-drone/ What is the average flight time of a drone?

          "title": "Anthropic's Sonnet 4.6 matches flagship AI performance at one-fifth the cost, accelerating enterprise adoption",
          "standfirst": "Anthropic on Tuesday released Claude Sonnet 4.6, a model that amounts to a seismic repricing event for the AI industry. It delivers near-flagship intelligence at mid-tier cost, and it lands squarely in the middle of an unprecedented corporate rush to deploy AI agents and automated coding tools.The model is a full upgrade across coding, computer use, long-context reasoning, agent planning, knowledge work, and design. It features a 1M token context window in beta. It is now the default model in claude.ai and Claude Cowork, and pricing holds steady at $3/$15 per million tokens — the same as its predecessor, Sonnet 4.5.That pricing detail is the headline that matters most. Anthropic&#x27;s flagship Opus models cost $15/$75 per million tokens — five times the Sonnet price. Yet performance that would have previously required reaching for an Opus-class model — including on real-world, economically valuable office tasks — is now available with Sonnet 4.6. For the thousands of enterprises now deploying AI agents that make millions of API calls per day, that math changes everything.Why the cost of running AI agents at scale just dropped dramaticallyTo understand the significance of this release, you need to understand the moment it arrives in. The past year has been dominated by the twin phenomena of \"vibe coding\" and agentic AI. Claude Code — Anthropic&#x27;s developer-facing terminal tool — has become a cultural force in Silicon Valley, with engineers building entire applications through natural-language conversation. The New York Times profiled its meteoric rise in January. The Verge recently declared that Claude Code is having a genuine \"moment.\" OpenAI, meanwhile, has been waging its own offensive with Codex desktop applications and faster inference chips.The result is an industry where AI models are no longer evaluated in isolation. They are evaluated as the engines inside autonomous agents — systems that run for hours, make thousands of tool calls, write and execute code, navigate browsers, and interact with enterprise software. Every dollar spent per million tokens gets multiplied across those thousands of calls. At scale, the difference between $15 and $3 per million input tokens is not incremental. It is transformational.The benchmark table Anthropic released paints a striking picture. On SWE-bench Verified, the industry-standard test for real-world software coding, Sonnet 4.6 scored 79.6% — nearly matching Opus 4.6&#x27;s 80.8%. On agentic computer use (OSWorld-Verified), Sonnet 4.6 scored 72.5%, essentially tied with Opus 4.6&#x27;s 72.7%. On office tasks (GDPval-AA Elo), Sonnet 4.6 actually scored 1633, surpassing Opus 4.6&#x27;s 1606. On agentic financial analysis, Sonnet 4.6 hit 63.3%, beating every model in the comparison, including Opus 4.6 at 60.1%.These are not marginal differences. In many of the categories enterprises care about most, Sonnet 4.6 matches or beats models that cost five times as much to run. An enterprise running an AI agent that processes 10 million tokens per day was previously forced to choose between inferior results at lower cost or superior results at rapidly scaling expense. Sonnet 4.6 largely eliminates that trade-off.In Claude Code, early testing found that users preferred Sonnet 4.6 over Sonnet 4.5 roughly 70% of the time. Users even preferred Sonnet 4.6 to Opus 4.5, Anthropic&#x27;s frontier model from November, 59% of the time. They rated Sonnet 4.6 as significantly less prone to over-engineering and \"laziness,\" and meaningfully better at instruction following. They reported fewer false claims of success, fewer hallucinations, and more consistent follow-through on multi-step tasks.How Claude&#x27;s computer use abilities went from &#x27;experimental&#x27; to near-human in 16 monthsOne of the most dramatic storylines in the release is Anthropic&#x27;s progress on computer use — the ability of an AI to operate a computer the way a human does, clicking a mouse, typing on a keyboard, and navigating software that lacks modern APIs.When Anthropic first introduced this capability in October 2024, the company acknowledged it was \"still experimental — at times cumbersome and error-prone.\" The numbers since then tell a remarkable story: on OSWorld, Claude Sonnet 3.5 scored 14.9% in October 2024. Sonnet 3.7 reached 28.0% in February 2025. Sonnet 4 hit 42.2% by June. Sonnet 4.5 climbed to 61.4% in October. Now Sonnet 4.6 has reached 72.5% — nearly a fivefold improvement in 16 months.This matters because computer use is the capability that unlocks the broadest set of enterprise applications for AI agents. Almost every organization has legacy software — insurance portals, government databases, ERP systems, hospital scheduling tools — that was built before APIs existed. A model that can simply look at a screen and interact with it opens all of these to automation without building bespoke connectors.Jamie Cuffe, CEO of Pace, said Sonnet 4.6 hit 94% on their complex insurance computer use benchmark, the highest of any Claude model tested. \"It reasons through failures and self-corrects in ways we haven&#x27;t seen before,\" Cuffe said in a statement sent to VentureBeat. Will Harvey, co-founder of Convey, called it \"a clear improvement over anything else we&#x27;ve tested in our evals.\"The safety dimension of computer use also got attention. Anthropic noted that computer use poses prompt injection risks — malicious actors hiding instructions on websites to hijack the model — and said its evaluations show Sonnet 4.6 is a major improvement over Sonnet 4.5 in resisting such attacks. For enterprises deploying agents that browse the web and interact with external systems, that hardening is not optional.Enterprise customers say the model closes the gap between Sonnet and Opus pricing tiersThe customer reaction has been unusually specific about cost-performance dynamics. Multiple early testers explicitly described Sonnet 4.6 as eliminating the need to reach for the more expensive Opus tier.Caitlin Colgrove, CTO of Hex Technologies, said the company is moving the majority of its traffic to Sonnet 4.6, noting that with adaptive thinking and high effort, \"we see Opus-level performance on all but our hardest analytical tasks with a more efficient and flexible profile. At Sonnet pricing, it&#x27;s an easy call for our workloads.\"Ben Kus, CTO of Box, said the model outperformed Sonnet 4.5 in heavy reasoning Q&A by 15 percentage points across real enterprise documents. Michele Catasta, President of Replit, called the performance-to-cost ratio \"extraordinary.\" Ryan Wiggins of Mercury Banking put it more bluntly: \"Claude Sonnet 4.6 is faster, cheaper, and more likely to nail things on the first try. That combination was a surprising combination of improvements, and we didn&#x27;t expect to see it at this price point.\"The coding improvements resonate particularly given Claude Code&#x27;s dominance in the developer tools market. David Loker, VP of AI at CodeRabbit, said the model \"punches way above its weight class for the vast majority of real-world PRs.\" Leo Tchourakov of Factory AI said the team is \"transitioning our Sonnet traffic over to this model.\" GitHub&#x27;s VP of Product, Joe Binder, confirmed the model is \"already excelling at complex code fixes, especially when searching across large codebases is essential.\"Brendan Falk, Founder and CEO of Hercules, went further: \"Claude Sonnet 4.6 is the best model we have seen to date. It has Opus 4.6 level accuracy, instruction following, and UI, all for a meaningfully lower cost.\"A simulated business competition reveals how AI agents plan over months, not minutesBuried in the technical details is a capability that hints at where autonomous AI agents are heading. Sonnet 4.6&#x27;s 1M token context window can hold entire codebases, lengthy contracts, or dozens of research papers in a single request. Anthropic says the model reasons effectively across all that context — a claim the company demonstrated through an unusual evaluation.The Vending-Bench Arena tests how well a model can run a simulated business over time, with different AI models competing against each other for the biggest profits. Without human prompting, Sonnet 4.6 developed a novel strategy: it invested heavily in capacity for the first ten simulated months, spending significantly more than its competitors, and then pivoted sharply to focus on profitability in the final stretch. The model ended its 365-day simulation at approximately $5,700 in balance, compared to Sonnet 4.5&#x27;s roughly $2,100.This kind of multi-month strategic planning, executed autonomously, represents a qualitatively different capability than answering questions or generating code snippets. It is the type of long-horizon reasoning that makes AI agents viable for real business operations — and it helps explain why Anthropic is positioning Sonnet 4.6 not just as a chatbot upgrade, but as the engine for a new generation of autonomous systems.Anthropic&#x27;s Sonnet 4.6 arrives as the company expands into enterprise markets and defenseThis release does not arrive in a vacuum. Anthropic is in the middle of the most consequential stretch in its history, and the competitive landscape is intensifying on every front.On the same day as this launch, TechCrunch reported that Indian IT giant Infosys announced a partnership with Anthropic to build enterprise-grade AI agents, integrating Claude models into Infosys&#x27;s Topaz AI platform for banking, telecoms, and manufacturing. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei told TechCrunch there is \"a big gap between an AI model that works in a demo and one that works in a regulated industry,\" and that Infosys helps bridge it. TechCrunch also reported that Anthropic opened its first India office in Bengaluru, and that India now accounts for about 6% of global Claude usage, second only to the U.S. The company, which CNBC reported is valued at $183 billion, has been expanding its enterprise footprint rapidly.Meanwhile, Anthropic president Daniela Amodei told ABC News last week that AI would make humanities majors \"more important than ever,\" arguing that critical thinking skills would become more valuable as large language models master technical work. It is the kind of statement a company makes when it believes its technology is about to reshape entire categories of white-collar employment.The competitive picture for Sonnet 4.6 is also notable. The model outperforms Google&#x27;s Gemini 3 Pro and OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.2 on multiple benchmarks. GPT-5.2 trails on agentic computer use (38.2% vs. 72.5%), agentic search (77.9% vs. 74.7% for Sonnet 4.6&#x27;s non-Pro score), and agentic financial analysis (59.0% vs. 63.3%). Gemini 3 Pro shows competitive performance on visual reasoning and multilingual benchmarks, but falls behind on the agentic categories where enterprise investment is surging.The broader takeaway may not be about any single model. It is about what happens when Opus-class intelligence becomes available for a few dollars per million tokens rather than a few tens of dollars. Companies that were cautiously piloting AI agents with small deployments now face a fundamentally different cost calculus. The agents that were too expensive to run continuously in January are suddenly affordable in February.Claude Sonnet 4.6 is available now on all Claude plans, Claude Cowork, Claude Code, the API, and all major cloud platforms. Anthropic has also upgraded its free tier to Sonnet 4.6 by default. Developers can access it immediately using claude-sonnet-4-6 via the Claude API.",

For the thousands of enterprises now deploying AI agents that make millions of API calls per day, that math changes everything.Why the cost of running AI agents at scale just dropped dramaticallyTo understand the significance of this release, you need to understand the moment it arrives in. The past year has been dominated by the twin phenomena of \"vibe coding\" and agentic AI. Claude Code — Anthropic&#x27;s developer-facing terminal tool — has become a cultural force in Silicon Valley, with engineers building entire applications through natural-language conversation. The New York Times profiled its meteoric rise in January. The Verge recently declared that Claude Code is having a genuine \"moment.\" OpenAI, meanwhile, has been waging its own offensive with Codex desktop applications and faster inference chips.The result is an industry where AI models are no longer evaluated in isolation. They are evaluated as the engines inside autonomous agents — systems that run for hours, make thousands of tool calls, write and execute code, navigate browsers, and interact with enterprise software. Every dollar spent per million tokens gets multiplied across those thousands of calls. At scale, the difference between $15 and $3 per million input tokens is not incremental. It is transformational.The benchmark table Anthropic released paints a striking picture. On SWE-bench Verified, the industry-standard test for real-world software coding, Sonnet 4.6 scored 79.6% — nearly matching Opus 4.6&#x27;s 80.8%. On agentic computer use (OSWorld-Verified), Sonnet 4.6 scored 72.5%, essentially tied with Opus 4.6&#x27;s 72.7%. On office tasks (GDPval-AA Elo), Sonnet 4.6 actually scored 1633, surpassing Opus 4.6&#x27;s 1606. On agentic financial analysis, Sonnet 4.6 hit 63.3%, beating every model in the comparison, including Opus 4.6 at 60.1%.These are not marginal differences. In many of the categories enterprises care about most, Sonnet 4.6 matches or beats models that cost five times as much to run. An enterprise running an AI agent that processes 10 million tokens per day was previously forced to choose between inferior results at lower cost or superior results at rapidly scaling expense. Sonnet 4.6 largely eliminates that trade-off.In Claude Code, early testing found that users preferred Sonnet 4.6 over Sonnet 4.5 roughly 70% of the time. Users even preferred Sonnet 4.6 to Opus 4.5, Anthropic&#x27;s frontier model from November, 59% of the time. They rated Sonnet 4.6 as significantly less prone to over-engineering and \"laziness,\" and meaningfully better at instruction following. They reported fewer false claims of success, fewer hallucinations, and more consistent follow-through on multi-step tasks.How Claude&#x27;s computer use abilities went from &#x27;experimental&#x27; to near-human in 16 monthsOne of the most dramatic storylines in the release is Anthropic&#x27;s progress on computer use — the ability of an AI to operate a computer the way a human does, clicking a mouse, typing on a keyboard, and navigating software that lacks modern APIs.When Anthropic first introduced this capability in October 2024, the company acknowledged it was \"still experimental — at times cumbersome and error-prone.\" The numbers since then tell a remarkable story: on OSWorld, Claude Sonnet 3.5 scored 14.9% in October 2024. Sonnet 3.7 reached 28.0% in February 2025. Sonnet 4 hit 42.2% by June. Sonnet 4.5 climbed to 61.4% in October. Now Sonnet 4.6 has reached 72.5% — nearly a fivefold improvement in 16 months.This matters because computer use is the capability that unlocks the broadest set of enterprise applications for AI agents. Almost every organization has legacy software — insurance portals, government databases, ERP systems, hospital scheduling tools — that was built before APIs existed. A model that can simply look at a screen and interact with it opens all of these to automation without building bespoke connectors.Jamie Cuffe, CEO of Pace, said Sonnet 4.6 hit 94% on their complex insurance computer use benchmark, the highest of any Claude model tested. \"It reasons through failures and self-corrects in ways we haven&#x27;t seen before,\" Cuffe said in a statement sent to VentureBeat. Will Harvey, co-founder of Convey, called it \"a clear improvement over anything else we&#x27;ve tested in our evals.\"The safety dimension of computer use also got attention. Anthropic noted that computer use poses prompt injection risks — malicious actors hiding instructions on websites to hijack the model — and said its evaluations show Sonnet 4.6 is a major improvement over Sonnet 4.5 in resisting such attacks. For enterprises deploying agents that browse the web and interact with external systems, that hardening is not optional.Enterprise customers say the model closes the gap between Sonnet and Opus pricing tiersThe customer reaction has been unusually specific about cost-performance dynamics. Multiple early testers explicitly described Sonnet 4.6 as eliminating the need to reach for the more expensive Opus tier.Caitlin Colgrove, CTO of Hex Technologies, said the company is moving the majority of its traffic to Sonnet 4.6, noting that with adaptive thinking and high effort, \"we see Opus-level performance on all but our hardest analytical tasks with a more efficient and flexible profile. At Sonnet pricing, it&#x27;s an easy call for our workloads.\"Ben Kus, CTO of Box, said the model outperformed Sonnet 4.5 in heavy reasoning Q&A by 15 percentage points across real enterprise documents. Michele Catasta, President of Replit, called the performance-to-cost ratio \"extraordinary.\" Ryan Wiggins of Mercury Banking put it more bluntly: \"Claude Sonnet 4.6 is faster, cheaper, and more likely to nail things on the first try. That combination was a surprising combination of improvements, and we didn&#x27;t expect to see it at this price point.\"The coding improvements resonate particularly given Claude Code&#x27;s dominance in the developer tools market. David Loker, VP of AI at CodeRabbit, said the model \"punches way above its weight class for the vast majority of real-world PRs.\" Leo Tchourakov of Factory AI said the team is \"transitioning our Sonnet traffic over to this model.\" GitHub&#x27;s VP of Product, Joe Binder, confirmed the model is \"already excelling at complex code fixes, especially when searching across large codebases is essential.\"Brendan Falk, Founder and CEO of Hercules, went further: \"Claude Sonnet 4.6 is the best model we have seen to date. It has Opus 4.6 level accuracy, instruction following, and UI, all for a meaningfully lower cost.\"A simulated business competition reveals how AI agents plan over months, not minutesBuried in the technical details is a capability that hints at where autonomous AI agents are heading. Sonnet 4.6&#x27;s 1M token context window can hold entire codebases, lengthy contracts, or dozens of research papers in a single request. Anthropic says the model reasons effectively across all that context — a claim the company demonstrated through an unusual evaluation.The Vending-Bench Arena tests how well a model can run a simulated business over time, with different AI models competing against each other for the biggest profits. Without human prompting, Sonnet 4.6 developed a novel strategy: it invested heavily in capacity for the first ten simulated months, spending significantly more than its competitors, and then pivoted sharply to focus on profitability in the final stretch. The model ended its 365-day simulation at approximately $5,700 in balance, compared to Sonnet 4.5&#x27;s roughly $2,100.This kind of multi-month strategic planning, executed autonomously, represents a qualitatively different capability than answering questions or generating code snippets. It is the type of long-horizon reasoning that makes AI agents viable for real business operations — and it helps explain why Anthropic is positioning Sonnet 4.6 not just as a chatbot upgrade, but as the engine for a new generation of autonomous systems.Anthropic&#x27;s Sonnet 4.6 arrives as the company expands into enterprise markets and defenseThis release does not arrive in a vacuum. Anthropic is in the middle of the most consequential stretch in its history, and the competitive landscape is intensifying on every front.On the same day as this launch, TechCrunch reported that Indian IT giant Infosys announced a partnership with Anthropic to build enterprise-grade AI agents, integrating Claude models into Infosys&#x27;s Topaz AI platform for banking, telecoms, and manufacturing. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei told TechCrunch there is \"a big gap between an AI model that works in a demo and one that works in a regulated industry,\" and that Infosys helps bridge it. TechCrunch also reported that Anthropic opened its first India office in Bengaluru, and that India now accounts for about 6% of global Claude usage, second only to the U.S. The company, which CNBC reported is valued at $183 billion, has been expanding its enterprise footprint rapidly.Meanwhile, Anthropic president Daniela Amodei told ABC News last week that AI would make humanities majors \"more important than ever,\" arguing that critical thinking skills would become more valuable as large language models master technical work. It is the kind of statement a company makes when it believes its technology is about to reshape entire categories of white-collar employment.The competitive picture for Sonnet 4.6 is also notable. The model outperforms Google&#x27;s Gemini 3 Pro and OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.2 on multiple benchmarks. GPT-5.2 trails on agentic computer use (38.2% vs. 72.5%), agentic search (77.9% vs. 74.7% for Sonnet 4.6&#x27;s non-Pro score), and agentic financial analysis (59.0% vs. 63.3%). Gemini 3 Pro shows competitive performance on visual reasoning and multilingual benchmarks, but falls behind on the agentic categories where enterprise investment is surging.The broader takeaway may not be about any single model. It is about what happens when Opus-class intelligence becomes available for a few dollars per million tokens rather than a few tens of dollars. Companies that were cautiously piloting AI agents with small deployments now face a fundamentally different cost calculus. The agents that were too expensive to run continuously in January are suddenly affordable in February.Claude Sonnet 4.6 is available now on all Claude plans, Claude Cowork, Claude Code, the API, and all major cloud platforms. Anthropic has also upgraded its free tier to Sonnet 4.6 by default. Developers can access it immediately using claude-sonnet-4-6 via the Claude API.",

For IT leaders evaluating their AI strategy, the acquisition is a signal that the industry&#x27;s center of gravity is shifting decisively from conversational interfaces toward autonomous agents that browse, click, execute code, and complete tasks on users&#x27; behalf.From playground project to the hottest acquisition target in AIOpenClaw&#x27;s path to OpenAI was anything but conventional. The project began life last year as \"ClawdBot\" — a nod to Anthropic&#x27;s Claude model that many developers were using to power it. Released in November 2025, it was the work of Steinberger, a veteran software developer with 13 years of experience building and running a company, who pivoted to exploring AI agents as what he described as a \"playground project.\"The agent distinguished itself from previous attempts at autonomous AI — most notably the AutoGPT moment of 2023 — by combining several capabilities that had previously existed in isolation: tool access, sandboxed code execution, persistent memory, skills and easy integration with messaging platforms like Telegram, WhatsApp, and Discord. The result was an agent that didn&#x27;t just think, but acted.In December 2025 and especially January and early February 2026, OpenClaw saw a rapid, \"hockey stick\" rate of adoption among AI \"vibe coders\" and developers impressed with its ability to complete tasks autonomously across applications and the entire PC environment, including carrying on messenger conversations with users and posting content on its own. In his blog post announcing the move to OpenAI, Steinberger framed the decision in characteristically understated terms. He acknowledged the project could have become \"a huge company\" but said that wasn&#x27;t what interested him. Instead, he wrote that his next mission is to \"build an agent that even my mum can use\" — a goal he believes requires access to frontier models and research that only a major lab can provide.Sam Altman confirmed the hire in a post stating that Steinberger would drive the next generation of personal agents at OpenAI.Anthropic&#x27;s missed opportunityThe acquisition also raises uncomfortable questions for Anthropic. OpenClaw was originally built to work on Claude and carried a name — ClawdBot — that nodded to the model. Rather than embrace the community building on its platform, Anthropic reportedly sent Steinberger a cease-and-desist letter, giving him a matter of days to rename the project and sever any association with Claude, or face legal action. The company even refused to allow the old domains to redirect to the renamed project.The reasoning was not without merit — early OpenClaw deployments were rife with security issues, as users ran agents with root access and minimal safeguards on unsecured machines. But the heavy-handed legal approach meant Anthropic effectively pushed the most viral agent project in recent memory directly into the arms of its chief rival.\"Catching lightning in a bottle\": LangChain CEO weighs in Harrison Chase, co-founder and CEO of LangChain, offered a candid assessment of the OpenClaw phenomenon and its acquisition in an exclusive interview for an upcoming episode of VentureBeat&#x27;s Beyond The Pilot podcast.Chase drew a direct parallel between OpenClaw&#x27;s rise and the breakout moments that defined earlier waves of AI tooling. He noted that success in the space often comes down to timing and momentum rather than technical superiority alone. He pointed to his own experience with LangChain, as well as ChatGPT and AutoGPT, as examples of projects that captured the developer imagination at exactly the right moment — while similar projects that launched around the same time did not.What set OpenClaw apart, Chase argued, was its willingness to be \"unhinged\" — a term he used affectionately. He revealed that LangChain told its own employees they could not install OpenClaw on company laptops due to the security risks involved. That very recklessness, he suggested, was what made the project resonate in ways that a more cautious lab release never could.\"OpenAI is never going to release anything like that. They can&#x27;t release anything like that,\" Chase said. \"But that&#x27;s what makes OpenClaw OpenClaw. And so if you don&#x27;t do that, you also can&#x27;t have an OpenClaw.\"Chase credited the project&#x27;s viral growth to a deceptively simple playbook: build in public and share your work on social media. He drew a parallel to the early days of LangChain, noting that both projects gained traction through their founders consistently shipping and tweeting about their progress, reaching the highly concentrated AI community on X.On the strategic value of the acquisition, Chase was more measured. He acknowledged that every enterprise developer likely wants a \"safe version of OpenClaw\" but questioned whether acquiring the project itself gets OpenAI meaningfully closer to that goal. He pointed to Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Cowork as a product that is conceptually similar — more locked down, fewer connections, but aimed at the same vision.Perhaps his most provocative observation was about what OpenClaw reveals about the nature of agents themselves. Chase argued that coding agents are effectively general-purpose agents, because the ability to write and execute code under the hood gives them capabilities far beyond what any fixed UI could provide. The user never sees the code — they just interact in natural language — but that&#x27;s what provides the agent with its expansive abilities.He identified three key takeaways from the OpenClaw phenomenon that are shaping LangChain&#x27;s own roadmap: natural language as the primary interface, memory as a critical enabler that allows users to \"build something without realizing they&#x27;re building something,\" and code generation as the engine of general-purpose agency.What this means for enterprise AI strategyFor IT decision-makers, the OpenClaw acquisition crystallizes several trends that have been building throughout 2025 and into 2026.First, the competitive landscape for AI agents is consolidating rapidly. Meta recently acquired Manus AI, a full agent system, as well as Limitless AI, a wearable device that captures life context for LLM integration. OpenAI&#x27;s own previous attempts at agentic products — including its Agents API, Agents SDK, and the Atlas agentic browser — failed to gain the traction that OpenClaw achieved seemingly overnight.Second, the gap between what&#x27;s possible in open-source experimentation and what&#x27;s deployable in enterprise settings remains significant. OpenClaw&#x27;s power came precisely from the lack of guardrails that would be unacceptable in a corporate environment. The race to build the \"safe enterprise version of OpenClaw,\" as Chase put it, is now the central question facing every platform vendor in the space.Third, the acquisition underscores that the most important AI interfaces may not come from the labs themselves. Just as the most impactful mobile apps didn&#x27;t come from Apple or Google, the killer agent experiences may emerge from independent builders who are willing to push boundaries the major labs cannot. IT decision-makers have to be asking themselves currently Will the claw close?The open-source community&#x27;s central concern is whether OpenClaw will remain genuinely open under OpenAI&#x27;s umbrella. Steinberger has committed to moving the project to a foundation structure, and Altman has publicly stated the project will stay open source. But OpenAI&#x27;s own complicated history with the word \"open\" — the company is currently facing litigation over its transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity — makes the community understandably skeptical.For now, the acquisition marks a definitive moment: the industry&#x27;s focus has officially shifted from what AI can say to what AI can do. Whether OpenClaw becomes the foundation of OpenAI&#x27;s agent platform or a footnote like AutoGPT before it will depend on whether the magic that made it viral — the unhinged, boundary-pushing, security-be-damned energy of an independent hacker — can survive inside the walls of a $300 billion company.As Steinberger signed off on his announcement: \"The claw is the law.\"",

          "title": "SurrealDB 3.0 wants to replace your five-database RAG stack with one",
          "standfirst": "Building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for AI agents often involves using multiple layers and technologies for structured data, vectors and graph information. In recent months it has also become increasingly clear that agentic AI systems need memory, sometimes referred to as contextual memory, to operate effectively.The complexity and synchronization of having different data layers to enable context can lead to performance and accuracy issues. It&#x27;s a challenge that SurrealDB is looking to solve.SurrealDB on Tuesday launched version 3.0 of its namesake database alongside a $23 million Series A extension, bringing total funding to $44 million. The company had taken a different architectural approach than relational databases like PostgreSQL, native vector databases like Pinecone or a graph database like Neo4j. The OpenAI engineering team recently detailed how it scaled Postgres to 800 million users using read replicas — an approach that works for read-heavy workloads. SurrealDB takes a different approach: Store agent memory, business logic, and multi-modal data directly inside the database. Instead of synchronizing across multiple systems, vector search, graph traversal, and relational queries all run transactionally in a single Rust-native engine that maintains consistency.\"People are running DuckDB, Postgres, Snowflake, Neo4j, Quadrant or Pinecone all together, and then they&#x27;re wondering why they can&#x27;t get good accuracy in their agents,\" CEO and co-founder Tobie Morgan Hitchcock told VentureBeat. \"It&#x27;s because they&#x27;re having to send five different queries to five different databases which only have the knowledge or the context that they deal with.\"The architecture has resonated with developers, with 2.3 million downloads and 31,000 GitHub stars to date for the database. Existing deployments span edge devices in cars and defense systems, product recommendation engines for major New York retailers, and Android ad serving technologies, according to Hitchcock.Agentic AI memory baked into the databaseSurrealDB stores agent memory as graph relationships and semantic metadata directly in the database, not in application code or external caching layers. The Surrealism plugin system in SurrealDB 3.0 lets developers define how agents build and query this memory; the logic runs inside the database with transactional guarantees rather than in middleware.Here&#x27;s what that means in practice: When an agent interacts with data, it creates context graphs that link entities, decisions and domain knowledge as database records. These relationships are queryable through the same SurrealQL interface used for vector search and structured data. An agent asking about a customer issue can traverse graph connections to related past incidents, pull vector embeddings of similar cases, and join with structured customer data — all in one transactional query.\"People don&#x27;t want to store just the latest data anymore,\" Hitchcock said. \"They want to store all that data. They want to analyze and have the AI understand and run through all the data of an organization over the last year or two, because that informs their model, their AI agent about context, about history, and that can therefore deliver better results.\"How SurrealDB&#x27;s architecture differs from traditional RAG stacksTraditional RAG systems query databases based on data types. Developers write separate queries for vector similarity search, graph traversal, and relational joins, then merge results in application code. This creates synchronization delays as queries round-trip between systems.In contrast, Hitchcock explained that SurrealDB stores data as binary-encoded documents with graph relationships embedded directly alongside them. A single query through SurrealQL can traverse graph relationships, perform vector similarity searches, and join structured records without leaving the database.That architecture also affects how consistency works at scale: Every node maintains transactional consistency, even at 50+ node scale, Hitchcock said. When an agent writes new context to node A, a query on node B immediately sees that update. No caching, no read replicas.\"A lot of our use cases, a lot of our deployments are where data is constantly updated and the relationships, the context, the semantic understanding, or the graph connections between that data needs to be constantly refreshed,\" he said. \"So no caching. There&#x27;s no read replicas. In SurrealDB, every single thing is transactional.\"What this means for enterprise IT\"It&#x27;s important to say SurrealDB is not the best database for every task. I&#x27;d love to say we are, but it&#x27;s not. And you can&#x27;t be,\" Hitchcock said. \"If you only need analysis over petabytes of data and you&#x27;re never really updating that data, then you&#x27;re going to be best going with object storage or a columnar database. If you&#x27;re just dealing with vector search, then you can go with a vector database like Quadrant or Pinecone, and that&#x27;s going to suffice.\"The inflection point comes when you need multiple data types together. The practical benefit shows up in development timelines. What used to take months to build with multi-database orchestration can now launch in days, Hitchcock said.",
          "content": "Building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for AI agents often involves using multiple layers and technologies for structured data, vectors and graph information. In recent months it has also become increasingly clear that agentic AI systems need memory, sometimes referred to as contextual memory, to operate effectively.The complexity and synchronization of having different data layers to enable context can lead to performance and accuracy issues. It&#x27;s a challenge that SurrealDB is looking to solve.SurrealDB on Tuesday launched version 3.0 of its namesake database alongside a $23 million Series A extension, bringing total funding to $44 million. The company had taken a different architectural approach than relational databases like PostgreSQL, native vector databases like Pinecone or a graph database like Neo4j. The OpenAI engineering team recently detailed how it scaled Postgres to 800 million users using read replicas — an approach that works for read-heavy workloads. SurrealDB takes a different approach: Store agent memory, business logic, and multi-modal data directly inside the database. Instead of synchronizing across multiple systems, vector search, graph traversal, and relational queries all run transactionally in a single Rust-native engine that maintains consistency.\"People are running DuckDB, Postgres, Snowflake, Neo4j, Quadrant or Pinecone all together, and then they&#x27;re wondering why they can&#x27;t get good accuracy in their agents,\" CEO and co-founder Tobie Morgan Hitchcock told VentureBeat. \"It&#x27;s because they&#x27;re having to send five different queries to five different databases which only have the knowledge or the context that they deal with.\"The architecture has resonated with developers, with 2.3 million downloads and 31,000 GitHub stars to date for the database. Existing deployments span edge devices in cars and defense systems, product recommendation engines for major New York retailers, and Android ad serving technologies, according to Hitchcock.Agentic AI memory baked into the databaseSurrealDB stores agent memory as graph relationships and semantic metadata directly in the database, not in application code or external caching layers. The Surrealism plugin system in SurrealDB 3.0 lets developers define how agents build and query this memory; the logic runs inside the database with transactional guarantees rather than in middleware.Here&#x27;s what that means in practice: When an agent interacts with data, it creates context graphs that link entities, decisions and domain knowledge as database records. These relationships are queryable through the same SurrealQL interface used for vector search and structured data. An agent asking about a customer issue can traverse graph connections to related past incidents, pull vector embeddings of similar cases, and join with structured customer data — all in one transactional query.\"People don&#x27;t want to store just the latest data anymore,\" Hitchcock said. \"They want to store all that data. They want to analyze and have the AI understand and run through all the data of an organization over the last year or two, because that informs their model, their AI agent about context, about history, and that can therefore deliver better results.\"How SurrealDB&#x27;s architecture differs from traditional RAG stacksTraditional RAG systems query databases based on data types. Developers write separate queries for vector similarity search, graph traversal, and relational joins, then merge results in application code. This creates synchronization delays as queries round-trip between systems.In contrast, Hitchcock explained that SurrealDB stores data as binary-encoded documents with graph relationships embedded directly alongside them. A single query through SurrealQL can traverse graph relationships, perform vector similarity searches, and join structured records without leaving the database.That architecture also affects how consistency works at scale: Every node maintains transactional consistency, even at 50+ node scale, Hitchcock said. When an agent writes new context to node A, a query on node B immediately sees that update. No caching, no read replicas.\"A lot of our use cases, a lot of our deployments are where data is constantly updated and the relationships, the context, the semantic understanding, or the graph connections between that data needs to be constantly refreshed,\" he said. \"So no caching. There&#x27;s no read replicas. In SurrealDB, every single thing is transactional.\"What this means for enterprise IT\"It&#x27;s important to say SurrealDB is not the best database for every task. I&#x27;d love to say we are, but it&#x27;s not. And you can&#x27;t be,\" Hitchcock said. \"If you only need analysis over petabytes of data and you&#x27;re never really updating that data, then you&#x27;re going to be best going with object storage or a columnar database. If you&#x27;re just dealing with vector search, then you can go with a vector database like Quadrant or Pinecone, and that&#x27;s going to suffice.\"The inflection point comes when you need multiple data types together.

Qodo, the AI code review startup, believes it has a solution with the launch of what it calls the industry&#x27;s first intelligent Rules System for AI governance — a framework that gives AI code reviewers persistent, organizational memory.The new system, announced today as part of Qodo 2.1, replaces static, manually maintained rule files with an intelligent governance layer. It automatically generates rules from actual code patterns and past review decisions, continuously maintains rule health, enforces standards in every code review, and measures real-world impact.For Itamar Friedman, CEO and co-founder of Qodo, the release represents a pivotal moment not just for his company but for the entire AI development tools space.\"I strongly believe that this announcement of ours is most important we ever done,\" Friedman said in an interview with VentureBeat.The &#x27;Memento&#x27; problemTo explain the limitation of current AI coding tools, Friedman invokes the 2000 Christopher Nolan film Memento, in which the protagonist suffers from short-term memory loss and must tattoo notes on his body to remember crucial information.\"Every time you call them, it&#x27;s a machine that wakes up from scratch,\" Friedman said of today&#x27;s AI coding assistants. \"So all it can do is, before it goes to sleep and restart, it could write whatever it did in a file.\"This approach—saving context to markdown files like agents.md or napkin.md—has become a common workaround among developers using tools like Claude Code and Cursor.

But he contends all of these remain fundamentally stateless.\"In order for software development to really revolutionize how we do software development for real world software, it needs to be a stateful machine,\" Friedman said.The core challenge, he explained, is that code quality is inherently subjective. Different organizations have different standards, and even teams within the same enterprise may approach problems differently.\"In order to really reach high level of automation, you need to be able to customize for the specific requirements of the enterprise,\" Friedman said. \"You need to be able to provide code in high quality. But quality is subjective.\"Qodo&#x27;s answer is what Friedman describes as \"memory that is built over a long time and is accessible to the coding agents, and then they can poke and check and verify that what they&#x27;re actually doing is according to the subjective needs of the enterprise.\"How Qodo&#x27;s Rules System worksQodo&#x27;s Rules System establishes what the company calls a unified source of truth for organizational coding standards. The system includes several key components:Automatic Rule Discovery: A Rules Discovery Agent generates standards from codebases and pull request feedback, eliminating manual authoring of rule files.Intelligent Maintenance: A Rules Expert Agent continuously identifies conflicts, duplicates, and outdated standards to prevent what the company calls \"rule decay.\"Scalable Enforcement: Rules are automatically enforced during pull request code review, with recommended fixes provided to developers.Real-World Analytics: Organizations can track adoption rates, violation trends, and improvement metrics to prove standards are being followed.Friedman emphasized that this represents a fundamental shift in how AI code review tools operate. \"It&#x27;s the first time that AI code review tool is moving from reactive to proactive,\" he said.The system surfaces rules based on code patterns, best practices, and its own library, then presents them to technical leads for approval. Once accepted, organizations receive statistics on rule adoption and violations across their entire codebase.A tighter connection between memory and agentsWhat distinguishes Qodo&#x27;s approach, according to Friedman, is how tightly the rules system integrates with the AI agents themselves—as opposed to treating memory as an external resource the AI must search through.\"At Qodo, this memory and agents are much more connected, like we have in our brain,\" Friedman said. \"There&#x27;s much more structure to it... where different parts are well connected and not separated.\"Friedman noted that Qodo applies fine-tuning and reinforcement learning techniques to this integrated system, which he credits for the company achieving an 11% improvement in precision and recall over other platforms, successfully identifying 580 defects across 100 real-world production PRs.Friedman offered a prediction for the industry: \"When you look one year ahead, it will be very clear that when we started 2026, we were in stateless machines that are trying to hack how they interact with memory. And we will have a very coupled way by the end of 2026, and Qodo 2.1 is the first blueprint of how to do that.\"Enterprise deployment and pricingQodo positions itself as an enterprise-first company, offering multiple deployment options. Organizations can deploy the system entirely within their own infrastructure via cloud premise or VPN, use a single-tenant SaaS option where Qodo hosts an isolated instance, or opt for traditional self-serve SaaS.The rules and memory files can reside wherever the enterprise requires—on their own cloud infrastructure or hosted by Qodo—addressing data governance concerns that enterprise customers typically raise.On pricing, Qodo is maintaining its existing seat-based model with usage quotas. At present, the company offers three pricing tiers: a free Developer plan for individuals with 30 PR reviews per month, a Teams plan at $38 per user per month (with 21% savings available for annual billing) that includes 20 PRs per user monthly and 2,500 IDE/CLI credits, and a custom-priced Enterprise plan with contact-us pricing that adds features like multi-repo context awareness, on-prem deployment options, SSO, and priority support.Friedman acknowledged the ongoing industry debate about whether seat-based pricing makes sense in an age of AI agents but said the company plans to address this topic more comprehensively later this year.\"If you get more value, you pay more,\" Friedman said. \"If you don&#x27;t, then we&#x27;re all good.\"Early customer responseOfer Morag Brin of HR technology company Hibob, an early user of the Rules System, reported positive results in a press statement Qodo shared with VentureBeat ahead of the launch.\"Qodo&#x27;s Rules System didn&#x27;t just surface the standards we had scattered across different places; it operationalized them,\" Brin said. \"The system continuously reinforces how our teams actually review and write code, and we are seeing stronger consistency, faster onboarding, and measurable improvements in review quality across teams.\"Founded in 2018, Qodo has raised $50 million from investors including TLV Partners, Vine Ventures, Susa Ventures, and Square Peg, with angel investors from OpenAI, Shopify, and Snyk.",

That’s where noise-canceling headphones earn their keep. A good pair doesn’t just quiet the world around you, it creates a pocket of calm so you can actually enjoy your music, podcasts or peace and quiet.Modern noise-canceling headphones have come a long way, combining powerful ANC with clearer sound, longer battery life and smarter features like adaptive modes and multipoint connectivity. Some emphasize comfort for long flights, while others are tuned for audiophiles who want studio-level clarity.We’ve tested a wide range of options to find the best noise-canceling headphones for every listener. Whether you’re after something lightweight for travel or a premium set for focused work sessions, these picks deliver the sound, silence and comfort you need to tune out the chaos. Best noise-canceling headphones of 2026 How to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you Design When you’re shopping for the best wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of this guide, I focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear, active noise-canceling headphones are much more effective at blocking outside sounds since your ears are completely covered. For gamers, there are also gaming headsets that feature noise cancellation — some even have detachable microphones, so they can double as over-ear headphones. However, for the purpose of this article, we’re only going to be focusing on noise-canceling headphones rather than headsets. Look for models with a comfortable headband and memory foam ear cups to ensure you can wear them for long periods without discomfort. Many headphones also come with a range of color options, so if aesthetics matter to you, you’ll find plenty of choices beyond just black or white. Whether you’re looking for something neutral or a bold pop of color, brands now offer a variety of styles to match your personal taste. Finally, if you’re planning to wear your headphones for long periods of time, it’s important to pick a model with a comfortable fit. Memory foam ear cups, an adjustable headband, and lightweight materials can make all the difference during extended listening sessions. After all, great sound is only part of the equation; comfort matters just as much. Type of noise cancellation Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of headphones offers. You’ll come across terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside and on the outside of the device to detect outside noise and cancel it out. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn’t change. Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience. Customization You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master & Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments. How we test noise-canceling headphones The primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours. To test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones. ANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review. Other noise-canceling headphones we tested AirPods Max Apple’s AirPods Max are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancellation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us. Dyson On-Trac The On-Trac headphones have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor, which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot for a set of $500 headphones. Sonos Ace The Sonos Ace is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users. Sony ULT Wear If most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the ULT Wear is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range. Beats Studio Pro The Studio Pro lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average. Master & Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen) The MH40 are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut. Bowers & Wilkins Px8 The company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the Px8 is more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S3. Noble Audio FoKus Apollo While this is my top pick for overall sound quality in our main guide to the best wireless headphones, the ANC performance is less impressive than the Px7 S3. Bowers & Wilkins gets the nod here for its improved noise cancellation over the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, and its overall excellent audio quality. Noise-canceling headphones FAQs Does noise cancellation block all noise? Noise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds. Is there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones? In terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds. Does noise cancellation impact sound quality? ANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html?src=rss",

By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn’t change. Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience. Customization You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master & Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments. How we test noise-canceling headphones The primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours. To test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones. ANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review. Other noise-canceling headphones we tested AirPods Max Apple’s AirPods Max are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancellation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us. Dyson On-Trac The On-Trac headphones have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor, which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot for a set of $500 headphones. Sonos Ace The Sonos Ace is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users. Sony ULT Wear If most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the ULT Wear is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range. Beats Studio Pro The Studio Pro lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average. Master & Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen) The MH40 are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut. Bowers & Wilkins Px8 The company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the Px8 is more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S3. Noble Audio FoKus Apollo While this is my top pick for overall sound quality in our main guide to the best wireless headphones, the ANC performance is less impressive than the Px7 S3. Bowers & Wilkins gets the nod here for its improved noise cancellation over the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, and its overall excellent audio quality. Noise-canceling headphones FAQs Does noise cancellation block all noise? Noise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds. Is there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones? In terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds. Does noise cancellation impact sound quality? ANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "There are just three models of Apple Watch — and $500 separates the most affordable from the premium model, with the flagship landing somewhere in between. Before the launch of the overhauled Apple Watch SE 3 in late 2025, it was pretty easy to direct most people to the Apple Watch Series 11. But with its new display and faster charging, the budget model makes a lot more sense now. There’s also a case for recommending the refreshed Apple Watch Ultra 3 to diehard adventurers and outdoor enthusiasts. Here, we spell out just what differentiates the models as well as what you get when you buy any Apple Watch. Using insights gleaned from Engadget’s own reviews, this guide will help you pick the best Apple Watch for you. Best Apple Watch in 2026 What to look for in an Apple Watch Like all Apple products, Apple Watches will only work with other devices from the brand's ecosystem. You won't be able to pair any Apple Watch to your Android phone. Note that you can pair other wearables (like a Garmin tracker or a Fitbit band) with your iPhone. There are some more features that are specific to Apple Watches and that set each of the three models apart from one another. Chips and sensors All three models in the current lineup have the same S10 SiP (system in a package) chip with a four-core Neural Engine. The chip allows for on-device processing of Siri requests as well as dictation, translation, automatic workout detection and the double tap and wrist flick gestures that let you control your watch hands-free. You get an optical heart rate sensor, temperature sensor, compass, altimeter, accelerometer, gyroscope and light sensor in every Apple Watch model, but the Series 11 and Ultra 3 have a more advanced heart monitor that in part enables the new hypertension detection feature. The two higher-end watches also have sensors that can generate an ECG and detect blood oxygen, water temperature and water depth. They also include an Ultra Wideband chip that works in conjunction with the latest AirTags to precisely find Apple’s trackers. Fall and crash detection come standard no matter which Apple wearable you pick and all support near field communication (NFC) for Apple Pay. If you opt for the cellular versions of the Series 11 or SE 3, your watch will have access to 5G networks. Cell connectivity comes standard on the Ultra 3 and the watch now also has satellite-enabled SOS, messaging and Find My abilities. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Displays and case options Every Apple Watch model now has an always-on display. The wide-angle OLED display on the Apple Watch 11 and Ultra 3 lets you see the always-on display from more angles. The SE can reach a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, the Series 11 can get as bright as 2,000 and the Ultra 3 hits 3,000 nits. Both higher-end screens can dim to a single nit, making them less distracting in the dark. And the Ultra model has the added night mode feature on certain watch faces that turns the dial red to preserve your night vision. As for case sizes, the SE 3 is available in 40 or 44mm. The Series 11 has a choice of a 42 or 46mm case. The Ultra 3 comes in just one size measuring 49mm. The SE 3 has an aluminum case in two colors (Starlight or Midnight). The Series 11 lets you pick from aluminum (in Rose Gold, Silver, Space Gray or Jet Black) or titanium (in Natural, Gold or Slate). And the Ultra 3 only comes in titanium (either Natural or Black). Battery life The Apple Watch Ultra 3 sports the biggest battery and can last for a claimed 42 hours on a charge. The Apple Watch 11 is rated to go for 24 hours and the SE 3 gets an estimated 18 hours before it needs a visit to the charger. Low power mode will get you many more hours, going for as long as 72 hours for the Ultra 3, 38 hours on the Series 11 and 32 hours on the SE 3. All three are now capable of fast charging and Apple states an 80 percent charge in 45 minutes for the SE 3 and Ultra 3 and 80 percent in 30 minutes for the Series 11. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Fitness and wellness features All three Apple Watches have similar fitness tracking chops. The Activity app uses three “rings” to keep tabs on how much you’re moving in a day: The Move ring tracks your active calories; the Exercise ring monitors the minutes you’ve spent walking, running, doing yoga and so on; and the Stand ring tells you how many hours in a day you’ve stood up and moved around for at least one minute. Different internal sensors detect those activities, for example the accelerometer senses when you’re moving versus sitting still, and the optical heart rate sensor judges how hard you're working out and how many calories you’ve burned. You can set your goals for each ring and you’ll earn badges and animations when you hit them. The Workout Buddy will work with all three watches, but you’ll need to have an Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhone nearby as well as Bluetooth headphones to use it. All three can access offline maps, which could prove useful when hiking far from cellular coverage. But if going off-grid is something you plan to do often, you may appreciate the satellite connectivity of the Apple Watch Ultra 3. Siri You can get the weather, start a workout, identify a song and dictate a text just by asking Siri. All Apple Watch models support the Raise to Speak feature that bypasses the need to say “Hey Siri” and will instead listen for your request when you lift your wrist near your mouth. Every Apple Watch model utilizes onboard processing of Siri requests now, too. That means executing simple requests like starting workouts and timers are quicker, as they won’t need to access external networks. However, requests like sending texts or getting weather forecasts still need to communicate with Wi-Fi or cellular, so you’ll need to have your phone nearby if you have a GPS-only model. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Carbon neutral claims Apple declared the Series 9 with the aluminum case its first carbon neutral product. But has since dropped those claims, possibly due to legal challenges in a German court. Instead, Apple states that all three watches have been designed to “reduce environmental impact” and the company still maintains its commitment to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. Price Perhaps the most surprising thing about the three new wearables was the lack of price increase from previous models. The Apple Watch SE still starts at $249, the Series 11 goes for $399 and up, and the Ultra 3 begins at $799. That puts a $550 difference between entry prices for the cheapest and most expensive Apple Watches. For $250 you can get the 40mm Apple Watch SE 3 with GPS-only connectivity; adding cellular connectivity ups the price by $50. The Apple Watch Series 11 starts at $399 for the 42mm, non-cellular model in aluminum and goes as high as $749 for the 46mm titanium case (which comes with cellular). The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is $799 for a titanium 49mm case with both GPS and cellular, but the price goes up with different bands. You may also need a few Apple Watch accessories, if so, you can factor that into your purchasing decision. Cherlynn Low for Engadget How we tested Apple Watches Engadget has been reviewing Apple Watches since the first one came out in 2015. Since then, we’ve tested every subsequent model Apple has released, including the Ultra and SE models, spending at least a few days or even a couple weeks with one strapped to our wrists. During that time, we run, hit the gym, go on hikes and wear it while sleeping, all the while gauging how it tracks various metrics, integrates with the iPhone and performs every other trick Apple claims its smartwatches can do. Since we also review smartwatches from other companies, such as Samsung's Galaxy Watches and Google Pixels, our editors can compare Apple Watches not just to previous generations, but also to other wearables on the market. Our buying guides and recommendations rely on first-hand testing by Engadget staff.

All three watches use the same Fitness and Workout apps to track your progress, and they all have sensors to track speed, cadence, distance and heart rate. But the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11 have more sensors than the Apple Watch SE 3. Additional tech includes an electrical heart rate sensor and a depth gauge. The two pricier watches also have a blood oxygen app and an ECG app, all of which may give you a better picture of your overall health. All three models are compatible with the AI-powered Workout Buddy from watchOS 26 (the feature also requires an AI-compatible iPhone). Are any of the Apple Watch series waterproof? All three models are water resistant. But they can all handle immersion in water, including a swim. The Apple Watch SE 3 and Series 11 can handle a depth of up to 50 meters while the Ultra 3 can be submerged up to 100 meters.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-apple-watch-160005462.html?src=rss",

But Verizon hasn't confirmed the plan to Ars, and a statement to another news outlet did not provide any timeline for implementing the change. As a refresher, the latest version of Verizon’s device unlocking policy for postpaid customers imposes a 35-day waiting period when a customer pays off the remaining balance of a device installment plan online, in the Verizon app, or with a Verizon gift card. There's also a 35-day waiting period after paying off an installment plan over the phone or at a Verizon Authorized Retailer. Saying restrictions are needed to counter fraud, Verizon will only unlock a phone immediately when someone pays off their device-plan balance at a Verizon corporate store or when someone pays off an installment plan on schedule via automatic payments. If you're partway into one of Verizon’s 36-month device installment plans and pay off the remaining balance early, but without making a trip to a Verizon corporate store, you'd have to wait 35 days for an unlock that would allow you to switch the phone to a different carrier's network.Read full article Comments",

There's a new Nissan Leaf that starts at a hair under $30,000 (as long as you ignore the destination charge). We'll soon drive the reborn Chevrolet Bolt—with a new lithium iron phosphate battery, it also has a price tag starting with a two (again, ignoring the destination charge). And the closer you get to $40,000, the more your options expand: the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Chevy Equinox EV, Toyota bZ, Tesla Model 3, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and Subaru Solterra all fall within that price bracket, and some of those are pretty good cars. But what if you only want to spend a fraction of that? Well, you won't be buying anything new, but then neither do three-quarters of American car buyers, and there's nothing wrong with that. A few weeks ago, we looked at what passes for the used EV bargain basement—ones that cost $5,000 or less. As long as you're OK with limited range and slow charging, going electric on a shoestring is possible. But if you're prepared to spend twice that, it turns out you've got plenty of options. As before, we stress that you should have a reliable place to charge an EV if you're going to buy one, which means at home at night or at work during the day. At this price range, you're unlikely to find something that DC fast charges quickly, and relying on public AC charging sounds stressful. You'll probably find a car with some battery degradation, but for the vast majority of models that use active battery cooling, this should be minimal; about 2 percent a year appears to be the average.Read full article Comments",

The groups have asked the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the EPA decision, which also eliminated requirements controlling greenhouse gas emissions in new cars and trucks. Urging a return to the status quo, the groups argued that the Trump administration is anti-science and illegally moving to benefit the fossil fuel industry, despite a mountain of evidence demonstrating the deadly consequences of unchecked pollution and climate change-induced floods, droughts, wildfires, and hurricanes.Read full article Comments",

We want media that is extremely dense and stable for centuries or more, and, ideally, doesn't consume any energy when not being accessed. Lots of ideas have floated around—even DNA has been considered—but one of the simplest is to etch data into glass. Many forms of glass are very physically and chemically stable, and it's relatively easy to etch things into it. There's been a lot of preliminary work demonstrating different aspects of a glass-based storage system. But in Wednesday's issue of Nature, Microsoft Research announced Project Silica, a working demonstration of a system that can read and write data into small slabs of glass with a density of over a Gigabit per cubic millimeter. Writing on glass We tend to think of glass as fragile, prone to shattering, and capable of flowing downward over centuries, although the last claim is a myth. Glass is a category of material, and a variety of chemicals can form glasses. With the right starting chemical, it's possible to make a glass that is, as the researchers put it, \"thermally and chemically stable and is resistant to moisture ingress, temperature fluctuations and electromagnetic interference.\" While it would still need to be handled in a way to minimize damage, glass provides the sort of stability we'd want for long-term storage.Read full article Comments",

Google DeepMind has been tinkering with Lyria for a while now, offering limited access in developer-oriented products like Vertex AI. Lyria 3 is more capable than previous versions, and it's also quicker to use. Just select the new \"Create music\" option in the Gemini app or web UI to get started. You can describe what you want and even upload an image to help the robot get the right vibe. And in a few seconds, you get music (or something like it). In case there was any uncertainty about whether Lyria tracks still counted as a human artistic endeavor, worry not! Unlike past versions of the model, you don't even have to provide lyrics in your prompt. You can be vague with your request, and the model will create suitable lyrics for the 30-second song.

          "content": "It's that time of year—a new budget Pixel phone is about to hit virtual shelves. The Pixel 10a will be available on March 5, and pre-orders go live today. The 9a will still be on sale for a while, but the 10a will be headlining Google's store. However, you might not notice unless you keep up with the Pixel numbering scheme. This year's A-series Pixel is virtually identical to last year's, both inside and out. Last year's Pixel 9a was a notable departure from the older design language, but Google made few changes for 2026. We liked that the Pixel 9a emphasized battery capacity and moved to a flat camera bump, and this time, it's really flat. Google says the camera now sits totally flush with the back panel. This is probably the only change you'll be able to identify visually.

          "content": "In Qing dynasty China, artisans augmented decorative pieces by incorporating iridescent kingfisher feathers—a technique known as tian-tsui. Scientists at Northwestern University's Center for Scientific Studies in the Arts have used high-energy X-ray imaging to achieve unprecedented nanoscale resolution of the unique structure of those feathers, presenting their findings at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. As previously reported, nature is the ultimate nanofabricator. The bright iridescent colors in butterfly wings, soap bubbles, opals, or beetle shells don’t come from any pigment molecules but from how they are structured—naturally occurring photonic crystals. In nature, scales of chitin (a polysaccharide common to insects), for example, are arranged like roof tiles. Essentially, they form a diffraction grating, except photonic crystals only produce specific colors, or wavelengths, of light, while a diffraction grating will produce the entire spectrum, much like a prism. In the case of kingfisher feathers, the color is due to the microscopic ridges that cover the parallel rows of keratin strands that grow along the central shaft. Also known as photonic band-gap materials, photonic crystals are “tunable,” which means they are precisely ordered to block certain wavelengths of light while letting others through. Alter the structure by changing the size of the tiles, and the crystals become sensitive to a different wavelength. They are used in optical communications as waveguides and switches, as well as in filters, lasers, mirrors, and various anti-reflection stealth devices.Read full article Comments",

Valve had added a note to its Steam Deck page noting that the device would be \"out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages.\" None of Valve's three listed Steam Deck configurations are currently available to buy, nor are any of the certified refurbished Steam Deck configurations that Valve sometimes offers. Valve hasn't announced any price increases for the Deck, at least not yet—the 512GB OLED model is still listed at $549 and the 1TB version at $649. But the basic 256GB LCD model has been formally discontinued now that it has sold out, increasing the Deck's de facto starting price from $399 to $549. Valve announced in December that it was ending production on the LCD version of the Deck and that it wouldn't be restocked once it sold out.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Over the last few years, evidence has piled up that psychedelic drugs can provide relatively rapid relief from the symptoms of clinical depression. The drugs seemingly work by boosting the brain's ability to remodel connections among neurons and incorporate new experiences. While we have a good picture of which proteins are responsible for the drug's hallucinogenic effects, we're still figuring out how those pathways plug into the brain's ability to change itself. Those lingering uncertainties aren't standing in the way of people trying to develop potentially life-altering treatments. One of the big challenges is probably the hallucinations themselves, which can potentially incapacitate someone for hours after a treatment. But researchers have now described a study showing that the shortest-acting psychedelic, DMT, appears to be just as effective as the rest. Fast-acting DMT, or dimethyltryptamine, is probably best known as a key component of ayahuasca, a liquid made from a combination of two or more plants. The mixture is important because the body produces an enzyme that rapidly digests DMT, blocking its effects. The additional plants contain a chemical that inhibits this enzyme, providing a longer-lasting experience.Read full article Comments",

They store not only passwords for pension, financial, and email accounts, but also cryptocurrency credentials, payment card numbers, and other sensitive data. All eight of the top password managers have adopted the term “zero knowledge” to describe the complex encryption system they use to protect the data vaults that users store on their servers. The definitions vary slightly from vendor to vendor, but they generally boil down to one bold assurance: that there is no way for malicious insiders or hackers who manage to compromise the cloud infrastructure to steal vaults or data stored in them. These promises make sense, given previous breaches of LastPass and the reasonable expectation that state-level hackers have both the motive and capability to obtain password vaults belonging to high-value targets. A bold assurance debunked Typical of these claims are those made by Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass, which together are used by roughly 60 million people. Bitwarden, for example, says that “not even the team at Bitwarden can read your data (even if we wanted to).” Dashlane, meanwhile, says that without a user’s master password, “malicious actors can’t steal the information, even if Dashlane’s servers are compromised.” LastPass says that no one can access the “data stored in your LastPass vault, except you (not even LastPass).”Read full article Comments",

Today, CloudBolt Software released a report, \"The Mass Exodus That Never Was: The Squeeze Is Just Beginning,\" that provides insight into those struggles. CloudBolt is a hybrid cloud management platform provider that aims to identify VMware customers’ pain points so it can sell them relevant solutions. In the report, CloudBolt said it surveyed 302 IT decision-makers (director-level or higher) at North American companies with at least 1,000 employees in January. The survey is far from comprehensive, but it offers a look at the obstacles these users face. Broadcom closed its VMware acquisition in November 2023, and last month, 88 percent of survey respondents still described the change as “disruptive.” Per the survey, the most cited drivers of disruption were price increases (named by 89 percent of respondents), followed by uncertainty about Broadcom’s plans (85 percent), support quality concerns (78 percent), Broadcom shifting VMware from perpetual licenses to subscriptions (72 percent), changes to VMware’s partner program (68 percent), and the forced bundling of products (65 percent).Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Imagine turning the key or pressing the start button of your car—and nothing happens. Not because the battery is dead or the engine is broken but because a server no longer answers. For a growing number of cars, that scenario isn’t hypothetical. As vehicles become platforms for software and subscriptions, their longevity is increasingly tied to the survival of the companies behind their code. When those companies fail, the consequences ripple far beyond a bad app update and into the basic question of whether a car still functions as a car. Over the years, automotive software has expanded from performing rudimentary engine management and onboard diagnostics to powering today’s interconnected, software-defined vehicles. Smartphone apps can now handle tasks like unlocking doors, flashing headlights, and preconditioning cabins—and some models won’t unlock at all unless a phone running the manufacturer’s app is within range.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "No one will supplant American and Chinese dominance in the space launch arena anytime soon, but several longtime US allies now see sovereign access to space as a national security imperative. Taking advantage of private launch initiatives already underway within their own borders, several middle and regional powers have approved substantial government funding for commercial startups to help them reach the launch pad. Australia, Canada, Germany, and Spain are among the nations that currently lack the ability to independently put their own satellites into orbit but which are now spending money to establish a domestic launch industry. Others talk a big game but haven't committed the cash to back up their ambitions. The moves are part of a wider trend among US allies to increase defense spending amid strained relations with the Trump administration. Tariffs, trade wars, and threats to invade the territory of a NATO ally have changed the tune of many foreign leaders. In Europe, there's even talk of fielding a nuclear deterrent independent of the nuclear umbrella provided by the US military.Read full article Comments",
