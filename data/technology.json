CrowdStrike Intelligence research published on January 29 documents how adversary groups operationalized this attack chain at an industrial scale. Threat actors are cloaking the delivery of trojanized Python and npm packages through recruitment fraud, then pivoting from stolen developer credentials to full cloud IAM compromise. In one late-2024 case, attackers delivered malicious Python packages to a European FinTech company through recruitment-themed lures, pivoted to cloud IAM configurations and diverted cryptocurrency to adversary-controlled wallets.Entry to exit never touched the corporate email gateway, and there is no digital evidence to go on.On a recent episode of CrowdStrike’s Adversary Universe podcast, Adam Meyers, the company&#x27;s SVP of intelligence and head of counter adversary operations, described the scale: More than $2 billion associated with cryptocurrency operations run by one adversary unit. Decentralized currency, Meyers explained, is ideal because it allows attackers to avoid sanctions and detection simultaneously. CrowdStrike&#x27;s field CTO of the Americas, Cristian Rodriguez, explained that revenue success has driven organizational specialization. What was once a single threat group has split into three distinct units targeting cryptocurrency, fintech and espionage objectives.That case wasn’t isolated. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and security company JFrog have tracked overlapping campaigns across the npm ecosystem, with JFrog identifying 796 compromised packages in a self-replicating worm that spread through infected dependencies.

Trojanized packages aren’t arriving through typosquatting as in the past — they’re hand-delivered via personal messaging channels and social platforms that corporate email gateways don’t touch.

Malicious code was scanned for credentials during package installation and exfiltrated to external domains.Dependency scanning catches the package.

Almost none have the second, which is runtime behavioral monitoring that detects credential exfiltration during the install process itself.“When you strip this attack down to its essentials, what stands out isn’t a breakthrough technique,” Shane Barney, CISO at Keeper Security, said in an analysis of a recent cloud attack chain. “It’s how little resistance the environment offered once the attacker obtained legitimate access.”Adversaries are getting better at creating lethal, unmonitored pivotsGoogle Cloud’s Threat Horizons Report found that weak or absent credentials accounted for 47.1% of cloud incidents in the first half of 2025, with misconfigurations adding another 29.4%. Those numbers have held steady across consecutive reporting periods. This is a chronic condition, not an emerging threat. Attackers with valid credentials don’t need to exploit anything. They log in.Research published earlier this month demonstrated exactly how fast this pivot executes. Sysdig documented an attack chain where compromised credentials reached cloud administrator privileges in eight minutes, traversing 19 IAM roles before enumerating Amazon Bedrock AI models and disabling model invocation logging.Eight minutes. No malware. No exploit. Just a valid credential and the absence of IAM behavioral baselines.Ram Varadarajan, CEO at Acalvio, put it bluntly: Breach speed has shifted from days to minutes, and defending against this class of attack demands technology that can reason and respond at the same speed as automated attackers.Identity threat detection and response (ITDR) addresses this gap by monitoring how identities behave inside cloud environments, not just whether they authenticate successfully. KuppingerCole’s 2025 Leadership Compass on ITDR found that the majority of identity breaches now originate from compromised non-human identities, yet enterprise ITDR adoption remains uneven.Morgan Adamski, PwC&#x27;s deputy leader for cyber, data and tech risk, put the stakes in operational terms.

They don’t check whether that identity is behaving consistently with its historical pattern or is randomly probing across infrastructure.Consider a developer who normally queries a code-completion model twice a day, suddenly enumerating every Bedrock model in the account, disabling logging first. An AI gateway sees a valid token. ITDR sees an anomaly.A blog post from CrowdStrike underscores why this matters now. The adversary groups it tracks have evolved from opportunistic credential theft into cloud-conscious intrusion operators.

In an analysis published February 4, CrowdStrike CTO Elia Zaitsev warned that \"a successful prompt injection against an AI agent isn&#x27;t just a data leak vector.

          "title": "TTT-Discover optimizes GPU kernels 2x faster than human experts — by training during inference",
          "standfirst": "Researchers from Stanford, Nvidia, and Together AI have developed a new technique that can discover new solutions to very complex problems. For example, they managed to optimize a critical GPU kernel to run 2x faster than the previous state-of-the-art written by human experts.Their technique, called “Test-Time Training to Discover” (TTT-Discover), challenges the current paradigm of letting models “think longer” for reasoning problems. TTT-Discover allows the model to continue training during the inference process and update its weights for the problem at hand.The limits of &#x27;frozen&#x27; reasoningCurrent enterprise AI strategies often rely on \"frozen\" models. Whether you use a closed or open reasoning model, the model&#x27;s parameters are static. When you prompt these models, they search for answers within the fixed manifold of their training data. This works well for problems that resemble what the model has seen before.However, true discovery problems, like inventing a novel algorithm or proving a new mathematical theorem, are, by definition, out-of-distribution. If the solution requires a leap of logic that doesn&#x27;t exist in the training set, a frozen model will likely fail, no matter how much compute you throw at it during inference.In comments to VentureBeat, Mert Yuksekgonul, a co-author of the paper and doctorate student at Stanford, illustrated this distinction using a famous mathematical breakthrough:\"I believe that thinking models wouldn&#x27;t be able to prove, for example, P != NP, without test-time training, just like Andrew Wiles wouldn&#x27;t be able to prove Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem without the 7 years he spent pursuing this single problem in isolation and continuously learning from his own failures.\"TTT-Discover treats the test problem not as a query to be answered, but as an environment to be mastered. As the model attempts to solve the problem, it generates different types of data: failures, partial successes, and errors. Instead of discarding this data, TTT-Discover uses it to update the model&#x27;s weights in real-time, effectively allowing the model to laser focus on that specific challenge as opposed to developing a very general problem-solving framework.A different approach to reinforcement learningTTT-Discover provides a fundamental shift on how reasoning models are trained. In standard reinforcement learning (RL) training, the goal is a generalist policy that performs well on average across many tasks. In TTT-Discover, the goal is to find the best solution to a very specific problem, and the policy is “a means towards this end,” according to the authors. Once the model discovers the artifact (i.e., the optimized code, the proof, or the molecule) the neural network that produced it can be discarded. To achieve this, the researchers engineered two specific components that differentiate TTT-Discover from standard reinforcement learning:Entropic objective: Standard RL optimizes for the average expected reward. If a model tries a risky path and fails, standard RL punishes it. TTT-Discover flips this. It uses an \"entropic objective\" that exponentially weighs high-reward outcomes. This forces the model to ignore \"safe,\" average answers and aggressively hunt for \"eureka\" outliers, solutions that have a low probability of being found but offer a massive reward.PUCT search: The system introduces PUCT, a tree-search algorithm inspired by AlphaZero. It explores different solution paths, building a dataset of attempts. The model then trains on this dataset in real-time, learning to recognize which partial steps lead to high-reward outcomes.Crucially, this method works best on problems with a continuous reward signal. The system needs a way to measure incremental progress such as \"runtime in microseconds\" or \"error rate\" rather than a binary \"pass/fail\" signal. This allows the model to follow the gradual improvement toward the optimal solution.The economics of &#x27;heavy inference&#x27;For enterprises accustomed to paying fractions of a cent per API call, the cost profile of TTT-Discover requires a mindset shift. In their experiments, the researchers reported that a single discovery run involves approximately 50 training steps and thousands of rollouts, costing roughly $500 per problem.TTT-Discover could be for “static, high-value assets” as opposed to trivial and recurring problems that can be solved with existing models and approaches.Consider a cloud-native enterprise running a data pipeline that processes petabytes of information nightly. If that pipeline relies on a specific SQL query or GPU kernel, optimizing that code by just 1% could save hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual compute costs. In this context, spending $500 to find a kernel that is 50% faster is a trivial expense with an immediate ROI.\"This makes the most sense for low-frequency, high-impact decisions where a single improvement is worth far more than the compute cost,\" Yuksekgonul said. \"Supply chain routing, drug design, and material discovery qualify. In these settings, spending hundreds of dollars on a single discovery step can easily pay for itself.\"Implementation considerationsOne of the most significant findings for enterprise adoption is that TTT-Discover does not require a proprietary frontier model. The researchers achieved state-of-the-art results using gpt-oss-120b, OpenAI’s open-weights model. The researchers have released the code for TTT-Discover to enable researchers and developers to use it for their own models.Because the technique works with open models, companies can run this \"discovery loop\" entirely within their own secure VPCs or on-premise H100 clusters without sending their proprietary data to third-party servers.“If a company already runs reinforcement learning, there is no additional infrastructure required,” Yuksekgonul said. “TTT-Discover uses the same training stack (GPUs, rollout workers, optimizers, checkpointing).” If they don’t already run RL, they would need to build that infrastructure. But enterprises can also use existing solutions to reduce the complexity of the process. The researchers orchestrated these training runs using the Tinker API by Thinking Machines, an API that manages the complexity of distributed training and inference. “Tooling such as Tinker (and open variants, e.g., OpenTinker) lowers the setup cost, and both labor and compute costs are likely to drop over time,” he said.Real-world use casesThe researchers deployed TTT-Discover across four distinct technical domains: systems engineering, algorithm design, biology, and mathematics. In almost every instance, the method set a new state-of-the-art.In one experiment, the model optimized GPU kernels for matrix multiplication (including the \"TriMul\" kernel used in AlphaFold), achieving execution speeds up to 2x faster than prior state-of-the-art and outperforming the best human-written kernels on the leaderboard.In competitive programming scenarios (AtCoder), it solved complex heuristic problems (e.g., optimizing geometric constraints for fishing nets) better than top human experts and prior AI baselines.For the enterprise, the transition from these academic benchmarks to business value hinges on one specific constraint: the existence of a verifiable, scalar signal. Unlike a chatbot that generates text, TTT-Discover needs a hard metric (e.g., runtime, error rate, or profit margin) to optimize against.Yuksekgonul said that this requirement draws a clear line between where this technology should and shouldn&#x27;t be used. \"At the moment, the key requirement is a reliable scalar signal of progress — cost, error, molecular properties — that the system can optimize against,\" he said.This directs enterprise adoption toward \"hard\" engineering and operations challenges such as logistics, supply chain, and resource management, where problems like fleet routing or crew scheduling often rely on static heuristics. TTT-Discover can treat these as optimization environments, spending hours to find a route structure that shaves 5% off daily fuel costs.The requirement for clear verifiers rules out qualitative tasks like \"write a better marketing strategy,\" where verification is subjective and prone to noise.\"Hard to verify problems are still an open question,” Yuksekgonul said. With current technology, the best path forward is to try to design verifiers, but “making those verifiers robust and hard to game is challenging, and we don’t have a good solution yet,\" he added.From inference to inventionThe broader implication is that enterprise AI stacks may need to evolve to support this kind of per-problem learning.“Systems built around a frozen model will need to support per-problem (or per-domain) adaptation, and enterprises will need better problem specifications and internal feedback signals to make test-time learning effective,” Yuksekgonul said. “If training runs inside a private VPC, the training loop can also be integrated with more of the company’s internal environment, not just a central lab pipeline.”For the enterprise, the value lies in identifying \"million-dollar problems,” optimization challenges where a verifiable metric exists, but human progress has stalled. These are the candidates for TTT-Discover. By accepting higher latency and cost for specific queries, enterprises can turn their inference compute into an automated R&D lab, discovering solutions that were previously out of reach for both humans and frozen AI models.",
          "content": "Researchers from Stanford, Nvidia, and Together AI have developed a new technique that can discover new solutions to very complex problems. For example, they managed to optimize a critical GPU kernel to run 2x faster than the previous state-of-the-art written by human experts.Their technique, called “Test-Time Training to Discover” (TTT-Discover), challenges the current paradigm of letting models “think longer” for reasoning problems. TTT-Discover allows the model to continue training during the inference process and update its weights for the problem at hand.The limits of &#x27;frozen&#x27; reasoningCurrent enterprise AI strategies often rely on \"frozen\" models. Whether you use a closed or open reasoning model, the model&#x27;s parameters are static. When you prompt these models, they search for answers within the fixed manifold of their training data. This works well for problems that resemble what the model has seen before.However, true discovery problems, like inventing a novel algorithm or proving a new mathematical theorem, are, by definition, out-of-distribution. If the solution requires a leap of logic that doesn&#x27;t exist in the training set, a frozen model will likely fail, no matter how much compute you throw at it during inference.In comments to VentureBeat, Mert Yuksekgonul, a co-author of the paper and doctorate student at Stanford, illustrated this distinction using a famous mathematical breakthrough:\"I believe that thinking models wouldn&#x27;t be able to prove, for example, P != NP, without test-time training, just like Andrew Wiles wouldn&#x27;t be able to prove Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem without the 7 years he spent pursuing this single problem in isolation and continuously learning from his own failures.\"TTT-Discover treats the test problem not as a query to be answered, but as an environment to be mastered. As the model attempts to solve the problem, it generates different types of data: failures, partial successes, and errors. Instead of discarding this data, TTT-Discover uses it to update the model&#x27;s weights in real-time, effectively allowing the model to laser focus on that specific challenge as opposed to developing a very general problem-solving framework.A different approach to reinforcement learningTTT-Discover provides a fundamental shift on how reasoning models are trained. In standard reinforcement learning (RL) training, the goal is a generalist policy that performs well on average across many tasks. In TTT-Discover, the goal is to find the best solution to a very specific problem, and the policy is “a means towards this end,” according to the authors. Once the model discovers the artifact (i.e., the optimized code, the proof, or the molecule) the neural network that produced it can be discarded. To achieve this, the researchers engineered two specific components that differentiate TTT-Discover from standard reinforcement learning:Entropic objective: Standard RL optimizes for the average expected reward. If a model tries a risky path and fails, standard RL punishes it. TTT-Discover flips this. It uses an \"entropic objective\" that exponentially weighs high-reward outcomes. This forces the model to ignore \"safe,\" average answers and aggressively hunt for \"eureka\" outliers, solutions that have a low probability of being found but offer a massive reward.PUCT search: The system introduces PUCT, a tree-search algorithm inspired by AlphaZero. It explores different solution paths, building a dataset of attempts. The model then trains on this dataset in real-time, learning to recognize which partial steps lead to high-reward outcomes.Crucially, this method works best on problems with a continuous reward signal. The system needs a way to measure incremental progress such as \"runtime in microseconds\" or \"error rate\" rather than a binary \"pass/fail\" signal. This allows the model to follow the gradual improvement toward the optimal solution.The economics of &#x27;heavy inference&#x27;For enterprises accustomed to paying fractions of a cent per API call, the cost profile of TTT-Discover requires a mindset shift. In their experiments, the researchers reported that a single discovery run involves approximately 50 training steps and thousands of rollouts, costing roughly $500 per problem.TTT-Discover could be for “static, high-value assets” as opposed to trivial and recurring problems that can be solved with existing models and approaches.Consider a cloud-native enterprise running a data pipeline that processes petabytes of information nightly. If that pipeline relies on a specific SQL query or GPU kernel, optimizing that code by just 1% could save hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual compute costs. In this context, spending $500 to find a kernel that is 50% faster is a trivial expense with an immediate ROI.\"This makes the most sense for low-frequency, high-impact decisions where a single improvement is worth far more than the compute cost,\" Yuksekgonul said. \"Supply chain routing, drug design, and material discovery qualify. In these settings, spending hundreds of dollars on a single discovery step can easily pay for itself.\"Implementation considerationsOne of the most significant findings for enterprise adoption is that TTT-Discover does not require a proprietary frontier model. The researchers achieved state-of-the-art results using gpt-oss-120b, OpenAI’s open-weights model. The researchers have released the code for TTT-Discover to enable researchers and developers to use it for their own models.Because the technique works with open models, companies can run this \"discovery loop\" entirely within their own secure VPCs or on-premise H100 clusters without sending their proprietary data to third-party servers.“If a company already runs reinforcement learning, there is no additional infrastructure required,” Yuksekgonul said. “TTT-Discover uses the same training stack (GPUs, rollout workers, optimizers, checkpointing).” If they don’t already run RL, they would need to build that infrastructure. But enterprises can also use existing solutions to reduce the complexity of the process. The researchers orchestrated these training runs using the Tinker API by Thinking Machines, an API that manages the complexity of distributed training and inference. “Tooling such as Tinker (and open variants, e.g., OpenTinker) lowers the setup cost, and both labor and compute costs are likely to drop over time,” he said.Real-world use casesThe researchers deployed TTT-Discover across four distinct technical domains: systems engineering, algorithm design, biology, and mathematics.

          "standfirst": "When we say that NordVPN is a good VPN that's not quite great, it's important to put that in perspective. Building a good VPN is hard, as evidenced by all the shovelware VPNs flooding the market. NordVPN may not be perfect, but it's easily top-five caliber and excels in certain use cases. First, the bad: NordVPN's apps could all stand to undergo a little more quality control, with elements distracting from other elements and inconsistent designs from platform to platform. At least one of its FAQ pages directly contradicts itself. And while all the server locations could unblock Netflix, the one in Nigeria still showed U.S. content, indicating that our real location might have leaked. However, there's a lot of good to balance that out. Speeds are fantastic and we saw no other hint of any kind of leak. Its server network is expansive and not overly reliant on virtual locations. The vast majority of servers are ideal for unblocking foreign websites. The real draw, though, is the extra features, including the innovative and flexible Meshnet, plus a malware blocker that acts more like a full antivirus and forward-looking quantum resistant encryption. Editor's note (9/24/25): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews. Check out how we test VPNs to learn more about the new standards we're using. Table of contents Findings at a glance Installing, configuring and using NordVPN NordVPN speed test NordVPN security test How much does NordVPN cost? NordVPN side apps and bundles Close-reading NordVPN's privacy policy Can NordVPN change your virtual location? Investigating NordVPN's server network Extra features of NordVPN NordVPN customer support options NordVPN background check Final verdict Findings at a glance Check out a summary of our NordVPN review in the table below. Category Notes Installation and UI Connections happen quickly and features are easy to use on all platforms UI sometimes gets in the way; map screens can be clunky and apps come with unnecessary notifications Surprisingly, the best UI may be in the browser extension Speed Extremely fast download speeds with only a 6.4-percent average drop Good latencies on nearby servers, but farther ones have some lag Fast upload speeds, but losses spiked in a few locations Security Uses acceptable protocols with uncracked encryption NordWhisper obfuscated protocol recently implemented on Windows, Android and Linux No DNS, WebRTC or IPv6 leaks on five test servers Pricing Best plan is the 2-year Basic for $81.36, or $3.39 per month Basic gives you the complete VPN If you get a multi-year plan, be sure to manually renew in order to keep the promotional rates Bundles Plus tier adds advanced malware protection and NordPass password manager Complete plan adds NordLocker cloud storage Prime tier adds ID theft protection and insurance features Privacy policy NordVPN does not log user activity on the VPN, a policy backed up by several third-party audits However, it does log potentially identifiable device information unless you opt out in settings Some concerning liberties taken in the overall Nord policy, but no documented malfeasance Virtual location change Four out of five test servers unblocked Netflix three times running, including virtual India location Location in Nigeria got into Netflix, but didn't change available titles Server network 153 server locations in 117 countries and territories Server network is about 40 percent virtual, including all locations in Africa Features Extra servers grant additional privacy (double VPN, Onion over VPN, obfuscation) or specific optimizations (P2P, dedicated IP) Threat Protection blocks dangerous domains and the Pro upgrade has some antivirus capability Dark Web Monitor reports to you when any sensitive information has appeared on clandestine leak sites Presets let you activate several settings with one click Post-quantum encryption is nice, but not necessary yet Kill switch is a useful safety feature on all apps Split tunneling by app on Windows and Android, and by URL on browser extensions Customer support Written FAQs, live chat and email support Live chat connected to an expert human within a minute FAQs are poorly organized and contain some conflicts, but well-written on average Background check NordVPN is headquartered in Panama, while its parent company Nord Security is based in the Netherlands 2018 theft of public keys was a mistake, but NordVPN did almost everything right in response Claims of law enforcement collaboration are overblown — NordVPN will comply with requests, but that doesn't mean they'll have information to provide Installing, configuring and using NordVPN NordVPN's biggest strengths are its speeds and the range of options it puts at your fingertips. User experience is important, but it's not quite as front-and-center as it is with ExpressVPN and Proton VPN. Here's how the apps run on all the major platforms. Windows The Windows app is the first instance of NordVPN's UI being not bad enough to complain about, but not good enough to be considered excellent. The initial connection process is a little slow, and it's far easier to connect than it is to disconnect (click the power button while connected to shut the VPN off). The map takes up space that would have been better allocated to the server list. Sam Chapman for Engadget The minor problems continue in the settings list, which makes the mistake of not keeping all its tabs visible in the window — if you open one, you have to click back to the main menu to reach another page. The pages themselves are easy to use; it's just a bit clunkier than it could have been. Mac Setup is swift and easy on Mac, but the full NordVPN interface is a little awkward. The vast majority of the main window is taken up by a large map, which is mostly useless. There's no way to zoom out to see the whole world, and you can't choose between servers in each country unless you zoom way in. The server list on the left-hand side is almost always more useful. Sam Chapman for Engadget The preferences panel is better. All the tabs come with clear explanations of their function, and are laid out so the menu is always visible, unlike the Windows app. The gear icon at the bottom includes its own set of tabs that encompass most of the common functions, including changing your VPN protocol, activating the kill switch and setting the VPN to automatically connect on untrusted networks. Android NordVPN on mobile can be described in much the same way as its desktop apps: generally great, occasionally getting in its own way. On Android, the map screen is much more helpful. It's expandable to the entire world and allows you to choose between servers within a country. On the other hand, the important settings are buried in the Profile tab, and the app notifies you about your \"security score\" to pressure you into activating certain settings. Sam Chapman for Engadget To find the general settings page on Android, tap the bottom-right Profile tab and scroll down. Except for Threat Protection, which has its own tab on the main window, every feature is located here. It's probably necessary to keep the main app from getting cluttered, but still mildly frustrating. iOS The NordVPN iOS app resembles a compressed version of the macOS client, for better or worse. As with Android, most of its features are in the bottom-right Profile tab. It works well most of the time, but often feels slightly cumbersome. There's a bit too much on the screen, and a bit too much of the stuff has nothing to do with the VPN's core function. Sam Chapman for Engadget As an example, you can't log into your account within the app — you have to load your Nord account page in a web browser. Forced app switching is a design choice that truly needs to die. That said, VPN connections happen quickly. If you tend to simply leave your VPN active, you probably won't notice any of this stuff. Browser extensions Most VPN browser extensions consist of the same features on a smaller scale, and NordVPN's — on Chrome, Firefox and Edge — are no exception. They are important for one reason, though: they're the only way to split tunnels by URL and the only split tunneling at all on macOS and iOS. Despite being more compact, they're also easy to use, making for an excellent quick-start VPN solution. Sam Chapman for Engadget NordVPN speed test All VPNs slow down your average browsing speeds by adding extra steps into the connection process. When we test speed, we're looking for the VPN to drag as little as possible on your unprotected speeds. Download speed will be the most important stat for most users, since that determines how fast web pages load and how quickly videos can buffer. Latency is important for live connections like video chats, games and live streaming. Latency increases with distance — in the test below, data packets were sent to the remote server, then back to our home network. Upload speeds likewise influence your live two-way communications and are also vital for torrenting. Let's see how NordVPN performs on all three metrics. Server location Latency (ms) Increase factor Download speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Upload speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Unprotected (Portland, OR, USA) 22 -- 59.20 -- 5.86 -- Seattle, WA, USA (Fastest) 44 2x 57.21 3.4 5.62 4.1 New York, NY, USA 177 8x 56.90 3.9 5.60 4.4 Stockholm, Sweden 371 16.9x 55.94 5.5 5.63 3.9 Istanbul, Turkey 411 18.7x 53.02 10.4 5.78 5.9 Hong Kong 350 15.9x 56.18 5.1 5.72 2.4 Johannesburg, South Africa 602 27.4x 53.26 10.0 5.67 3.3 Average 326 14.8x 55.42 6.4 5.54 4.0 To summarize: NordVPN's download speeds are the fastest we've seen and its upload speeds and latency tie with the best. Downloads only dropped by an average of 6.4 percent across the globe and readings were mostly consistent — the servers in question performed much the same in each test. We even threw in Turkey and South Africa, two locations that commonly cause problems, but NordVPN still kept the drop to 10 percent. Sam Chapman for Engadget Latency is more a product of physical distance than VPN infrastructure, but you can still see differences between services. When tested on a similar range of locations, ExpressVPN and Proton VPN both kept average latencies under 300 ms. NordVPN's average came out to 326 milliseconds, though we should note that its latency increased less than Proton's on the closest server. Upload speeds declined an average of four percent, but there were a few anomalously high readings in Istanbul that skewed those numbers up. Without that location, NordVPN's upload rates would also have been the industry's current best. NordVPN security test No matter how well-built a VPN looks from the outside, there are several ways its security can fail. The most common problems are outdated protocols with weak encryption, failing to block IPv6 traffic or inadvertent leaks from sending DNS requests outside the encrypted tunnel. We'll start by looking for those common leak sources, then check whether NordVPN's encryption might be failing in less traceable ways. VPN protocols A VPN protocol is a set of rules used to get data quickly and safely from your device to a VPN server and back, even while that data is encrypted. Different protocols are connected with different encryption algorithms and can impact the speed, security and stability of your connection. When testing VPN security, the first step is to see if it's using any protocols like PPTP that are outdated and crackable, or homebrewed protocols with unclear security. NordVPN users have four options for protocols: OpenVPN, IKEv2 (not available on Mac or iOS), NordLynx and NordWhisper (available on Windows, Android and Linux only). Sam Chapman for Engadget OpenVPN and IKEv2 are both standard protocols you'll find on most VPN providers. Both use various strengths of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), with OpenVPN defaulting to AES-256 and IKEv2 to AES-128. OpenVPN can be set to UDP (faster but less stable) or TCP (more reliable but slower). So far, so secure. NordLynx is unique to NordVPN, but it's not that far off the beaten track — it's just WireGuard with extra security. WireGuard normally works by saving a stable IP address for each connection, which raises the very slight risk of exposing a user. NordLynx adds a second layer of abstraction that means those stable addresses are never revealed. Since NordVPN strongly recommends it for most situations, we used it for all our tests in this review. Finally, there's NordWhisper, a new protocol introduced in early 2025 that disguises your VPN traffic as normal web traffic to evade blanket web blocks. It's likely to be slower than the other protocols, so don't use it unless everything else has been blocked. We also don't recommend counting on it too much in general — large-scale censorship technology, like the Great Firewall of China, tends to rely on blocklists of known VPN servers, whose identity NordWhisper can't disguise. Leak test Our first order of business was to check five test servers to see if they leaked our real IP address — staying away from the ones in the speed test in order to get as comprehensive a picture of NordVPN's security as possible. With help from ipleak.net, we found all five to be free of the three major types of leaks. DNS leaks occur when a VPN sends DNS requests (in short, how your browser knows which websites to show you) outside its encrypted tunnel. By default, NordVPN uses its own private DNS servers, which our tests showed to effectively prevent leaks. WebRTC leaks are caused by real-time communication protocols sending information outside the VPN, which may reveal your real IP address. NordVPN is consistently successful at keeping WebRTC inside the tunnel, but you can have your browser block it if you're still worried. IPv6 leaks happen when a VPN only blocks IPv4 traffic and lets v6 through. NordVPN automatically blocks IPv6 traffic while it's active, so an IPv6 leak is all but impossible. Sam Chapman for Engadget Although that's all great news, it is still possible for leaks to occur without a clear explanation, so we ran one final test on NordVPN. Encryption test Wireshark is a program that captures detailed images of information sent over a device's internet connection. Even though our tests showed NordVPN to be free of leaks, we wanted to inspect it at the most granular level. Using WireShark, we recorded the traffic sent to an unencrypted HTTP site, before and after connecting to each NordVPN test server. Every server showed the same pattern: readable plaintext before, encrypted ciphertext after. If there is a security flaw remaining in NordVPN, it's unlikely to be relevant to the overwhelming majority of users. How much does NordVPN cost? NordVPN's pricing structure looks convoluted at first, but it's much simpler than it appears. A Basic subscription gets you full VPN functionality, and all the other tiers just add more features. If all you need is a VPN, you only need to concern yourself with the left side of the table below. The best deal for a Basic NordVPN subscription, which lets you connect to NordVPN with up to 10 devices at once, costs $81.36 for two years when you pay upfront ($3.39 per month). One year of the same plan costs $59.88 in advance ($4.99 per month) or $12.99 for one month at a time. The table below shows the complete cost; for more information on plans above Basic, see \"side apps and bundles\" in the next section. Plan 1-month cost 1-year cost 2-year cost Basic $12.99 $59.88 ($4.99/month) $81.36 ($3.39/month) Plus $13.99 $71.88 ($5.99/month) $105.36 ($4.39/month) Complete $14.99 $83.88 ($6.99/month) $129.36 ($5.39/month) Prime $17.99 $107.88 ($8.99/month) $177.36 ($7.39/month) The longer plans save money, but be careful: if you let them expire, you'll automatically renew at the more expensive one-year plan. Enough customers claim to have been auto-renewed at the higher rate that they've launched a class-action lawsuit against NordVPN, accusing the company of deceptive pricing practices and making renewals too difficult to cancel. A NordVPN PR rep said they could not comment on ongoing legal action, \"other than to state that we are and always have been very clear about the recurring nature of our services.\" No court date has been set so far. That said, there's a fairly straightforward workaround in the meantime: To prevent the auto renewal, log out of your NordVPN account, then sign up for a discounted plan again using the same email. As long as you do this before your subscription expires, your new account should link to your old one, keeping you subscribed at the introductory rate. Free trials and refunds Every NordVPN plan comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you cancel and request a refund before 30 days are up, you'll get the full cost back. The only way to try it for free without paying is to get the app on Android, where there's a seven-day trial through the Google Play Store. NordVPN side apps and bundles NordVPN is part of a larger family of Nord Security products, which you can save money on if you need more than one. We won't review all of them here, but for reference, here's everything you'll get from the higher subscription tiers. Basic: VPN on 10 devices, specialty servers, DNS ad-blocking, Meshnet Plus: All Basic features, plus malware scanning, extra scam blocking, tracker blocking, NordPass password manager, data breach scanner Complete: All Plus features, along with 1TB of NordLocker encrypted cloud storage Prime: All Complete features, plus NordProtect features like dark web monitoring, credit monitoring, ID theft insurance and extortion insurance Another tier called Ultra includes a subscription to Incogni, a data removal service run by Nord's partner Surfshark. The Ultra bundle is only available in certain countries, since NordVPN is still testing it; users outside the test countries can still add Incogni service at checkout. There also used to be a NordVPN family plan, but it seems to have been eliminated after Nord expanded the devices per subscription to 10. You can get a dedicated IP address on NordVPN to ensure you have the same IP every time you connect. This lets you configure remote firewalls to let you through while you're connected to the VPN. A dedicated IP costs $8.99 per month, $70.68 for a year ($5.89 per month) or $100.56 for two years ($4.19 per month). The NordVPN pricing page lists access to a Saily eSIM plan as a perk, though mysteriously, none of the existing plans seem to include it yet. A lot of VPNs are expanding into the eSIM space, so this may change soon. Close-reading NordVPN's privacy policy A VPN privacy policy isn't just empty words — it's a contract between the provider and its users. If a service openly defied its own policy, it could be sued for false advertising. VPNs tend to sneak loopholes into their privacy policies instead of flouting them outright; these loopholes can shed light on how the provider actually views your privacy. We combed through NordVPN's privacy policy to see whether it tries to take any such liberties. The policy has two parts: the general Nord Security policy and an addendum specific to NordVPN. General Nord privacy policy This policy applies to all Nord Security apps. It's impossible to create an account without a valid email address, but you can use a separate email masking service to make that anonymous. The policy also explicitly says that your email address will be added to a marketing mailing list, though you can opt out. Irritating, but not a privacy risk in itself. We're more concerned about the later statement that it may process data without the user's consent \"under the legal basis of our or third parties' legitimate interest.\" This clause covers some cases we'd agree are legitimate, such as identifying people who launch cyberattacks from NordVPN servers. But Nord also considers it \"legitimate interest\" to process your personal data \"to improve or maintain our services and provide new products and features.\" Reached for comment, a NordVPN representative said that using personal data in this way \"generally involves aggregated, depersonalized or technical information.\" That's somewhat reassuring, but the \"generally\" leaves a bit too much wiggle room. Ideally, we'd prefer that personal data exist wholly in the \"consent only\" section. The section on sharing your data with third parties only lists \"some of\" the service providers who may receive your information. Among these are Google Analytics, which is known to store personal data on U.S. servers — all of which are potential security risks in the age of DOGE. Other unnamed \"third parties\" are involved in targeting ads at users of Nord websites. The NordVPN representative said that \"since some partners, such as payment processors, can vary by region or specific service and may change over time depending on our operational needs, we do not publish a fixed list.\" They added that all third parties are \"contractually required to handle personal data in accordance with applicable laws and industry standards.\" We aren't using this to condemn Nord; many of these practices are fairly standard in the VPN industry. But it's important to know about all the potential leakage points before trusting your deepest secrets to any company. NordVPN specific policies The NordVPN privacy policy doesn't add much atop the general Nord notice. It does track session activity connected to your username to make sure you're staying within the 10-device limit, but it automatically deletes these logs 15 minutes after you disconnect. The logs also don't include your IP address or the addresses of VPN servers you used. Sam Chapman for Engadget The only real problem we found is that NordVPN apps collect information about your activity on the app by default. This doesn't include information about your browsing habits, but it does include unique traits that could conceivably be used for \"device fingerprinting\" — in which a third party can deduce a user's identity through clues about their device. You can turn this off in the General settings. A NordVPN spokesperson told us that the data collected is \"not personally identifiable,\" and that the company takes \"deliberate steps to strip out anything that could be linked back to a specific person.\" This presumably means the data is aggregated so it only shows general trends, not any one device's activity. That's a lot less risky, but we still recommend switching the setting off. Third-party privacy audits NordVPN has passed five independent audits of its privacy policy so far, most recently from Deloitte in late 2024. Annoyingly, you can only read the entire report by logging into a Nord account, but it at least doesn't have to be a paid account. The audit found that NordVPN was following its own no-logs policy. Specifically, the Deloitte Lithuania investigators concluded that \"the configuration of IT systems and management of the supporting IT operations is properly prepared, in all material respects in accordance with the NordVPN's description set out in the Appendix I.\" (Appendix I of the report is identical to NordVPN's privacy policy.) Can NordVPN change your virtual location? You'll be most interested in this section if you mainly use a VPN to change their location for streaming. To see if NordVPN could unlock new streaming libraries, we picked a new batch of five test servers, then logged onto Netflix. Since Netflix tries to block all VPN servers to prevent copyright issues, our first question was whether we'd get through at all. Our second question: would connecting to a NordVPN server actually change what Netflix library we saw? It should, given that NordVPN seems leak-proof, but thoroughness demands we check anyway. Here's what we found. Server location Netflix unblocked? Content changed? Canada Yes Yes Argentina Yes Yes Germany Yes Yes India Yes Yes Nigeria Yes No Four out of five locations worked perfectly. On a Canadian server, we were able to stream Star Trek: The Next Generation, which left American Netflix years ago. The Argentine server gave us access to something called Pasion de Gavilanes, which we'd never heard of but sounds great. Sam Chapman for Engadget The only problem was Nigeria. We tested it several times, connected to multiple different Nigerian locations, but saw our American Netflix library every time. We then ran a leak test on Nigeria, which wasn't one of our security test locations, and found it to be working normally. It's hard to say what happened, especially since the Nigeria server doesn't appear to be virtual, but we can confirm that it wasn't working. Investigating NordVPN's server network NordVPN has servers in 153 cities in 117 countries. Out of all total options, 62 are virtual locations (about 40 percent), where the server is really located somewhere else. This makes it possible to get servers into more places, but depending on your actual location relative to the server, it may perform differently than you expect. Sam Chapman for Engadget Virtual locations have allowed NordVPN's server network to grow quite extensive, with lots more locations in South America, Africa and Asia than the industry standard. Check out the distribution in the table. Region Countries and territories with servers Total server locations Total virtual server locations North America 15 36 12 South America 10 10 6 Europe 48 57 11 Africa 10 10 10 Middle East 7 7 4 Asia 24 26 18 Oceania 3 7 1 Total 117 153 62 (40.5 percent) The relatively low proportion of virtual locations (nearly identical to that of ExpressVPN) is a good sign, as it means NordVPN has been growing its server network thoughtfully. Some VPNs — looking at you, HMA — inflate their server lists as a marketing point without seriously considering what it takes to maintain such a large network. That thankfully doesn't seem to be the case here. Extra features of NordVPN Here's everything you get with a NordVPN app other than the VPN itself. There's a lot going on here, so we'll limit ourselves to a sketch of each feature. Specialty servers As soon as you load NordVPN, you'll see a list of special servers near the top of the right-hand column. We'll go over each of them in order. Dedicated IP: As discussed in the bundles section, a dedicated IP address costs extra. With this, you'll always connect with the same IP, which is private to you alone. It may be worth the price if you find yourself getting asked for CAPTCHAs a lot more while connected to NordVPN — though for what it's worth, that didn't happen to us. Double VPN: This sends your connection through a second VPN server before it reaches your ISP. The second server is your apparent location. There are 10 endpoints to choose from. As you might imagine, your internet will run slower with two VPN servers in the mix, so only use this if you seriously need security. Obfuscated servers: These are only available on OpenVPN. Obfuscation can help you get around firewalls that seek out and block VPN traffic. If you can't get online with NordVPN when you're on a certain network, obfuscated servers might work. Onion Over VPN: After encrypting your data as normal, these servers send it through several nodes of the Tor network, granting you the total anonymity of onion routing while keeping you safe from malicious relays. It's available in two locations, Netherlands and Switzerland, and — like double VPN — is best used only when you need the utmost privacy. P2P: NordVPN only allows torrenting on its peer-to-peer servers, but fortunately, it's got P2P servers in 114 countries — only three fewer than it has in total. NordVPN keeps your download and upload speeds very fast on average, so you shouldn't have trouble torrenting from any location. Meshnet Meshnet is NordVPN's most unique and exciting feature by a long shot. By logging into the same NordVPN account on multiple devices, you can connect those devices directly through a NordLynx tunnel without needing a NordVPN server in between. Sam Chapman for Engadget Essentially, you're using your own devices as VPN servers — obviously not great for privacy, but amazing for accessing web services in other countries. While two devices are connected, you can transfer files between them through the NordLynx tunnel. You can even invite friends and use their devices. Threat Protection NordVPN has two levels of antivirus: Threat Protection and Threat Protection Pro. The former is a simple DNS filter that stops your browsing from loading unsafe web pages while NordVPN is active. It's the highest level available on Android, iOS and Linux, or on any Basic subscription. Sam Chapman for Engadget Threat Protection Pro, which Plus subscribers or higher can set up on Windows and Mac, can work even when you aren't connected to a NordVPN server. It acts more like a standalone antivirus by scanning downloaded files for malware, and can even block trackers. Basic Threat Protection (without Pro) can block some trackers by filtering out domains known to use them, but doesn't block the trackers directly. Dark Web Monitor While active, Dark Web Monitor continually searches known data breach dump sites on the dark web and notifies you if it ever finds your account email address. If you get that notification, change any passwords associated with the address. With a Prime subscription, you can also have it search for your phone number, social security number or other financial information. Presets Presets let you set up one-click VPN connections with a desired group of settings, a lot like Proton VPN's Profiles. NordVPN comes pre-loaded with presets that optimize for \"Downloads,\" \"Speed\" and \"Browsing,\" which sounds to us like the same thing three times. More usefully, you can create presets for particular countries, then add website shortcuts that will appear once you've connected. You could, for example, set one that connects to a specific location, then add a shortcut to a streaming site available in that location. Post-Quantum encryption Experts widely believe that quantum computers will eventually make our current encryption algorithms obsolete, but there's almost no consensus on when that will actually happen — except that it hasn't happened yet. Knowing that, NordVPN's \"post-quantum encryption\" feature comes across as a bit premature, but it's reassuring that someone is thinking about it. Having said that, we don't recommend using post-quantum encryption yet. It works by layering one of the known quantum-proof encryption standards on top of a standard NordLynx session, which makes your VPN connection slower and more erratic. Until we can verify a real quantum cyberattack, post-quantum encryption is a needless precaution. Kill switch A kill switch cuts off your internet the instant you lose your connection to a NordVPN server. This protects you in case a server unexpectedly fails, and as a side benefit, prevents you from connecting to any fake VPN servers. You should keep the kill switch on at all times. Split tunneling Split tunneling is available on NordVPN's Windows and Android apps (and Android TV by extension), along with its browser extensions. On Windows and Android, it splits by app: you can determine which apps get online through the VPN and which go unprotected. The browser extensions let you split by URL, so the VPN only protects certain sites. NordVPN customer support options NordVPN's apps link directly to its online help center. As always, we went in with a specific question in mind: whether the basic level of Threat Protection could block trackers, and if so, what kind. We found the categories on the written support page difficult to parse, especially the troubleshooting section — would the average user appreciate the difference between \"app issues,\" \"connection issues\" and \"errors\"? We correctly guessed that our question would be under \"Using NordVPN -> Features,\" but the introductory article on Threat Protection and Threat Protection Pro was buried at the bottom of the list. Unfortunately, that made things more confusing, as this article says that Threat Protection (not Pro) both does and doesn't block trackers. In NordVPN's favor, however, using the search bar brought us instantly back to that article without any confusion. The live support experience Using NordVPN's live chat was a smooth and reassuring experience. From the time we decided to ask directly, it took us less than a minute to connect with a real person, who quickly cleared up the confusion and promised to update the confusing support page (we'll check back to see if they actually do). Sam Chapman for Engadget One other option is an email support form, which can be found both on the website and in the help sections of NordVPN apps. This is best for complex problems that require screenshots to explain, and promises a response within 24 hours. NordVPN background check NordVPN was founded in 2012. Launching with its desktop apps, it moved to iOS and Android in 2016, then added apps for browser extensions and smart TVs. Its developer, Nord Security, has no parent company, and its history is relatively uncontroversial. We've documented two notable incidents below, plus more about Nord Security's operations. Headquarters and ownership Nord Security was founded in Lithuania, and maintains offices there. Although Nord Security is registered in Amsterdam, NordVPN operates under a separate license in Panama, which makes any data requests subject to Panama's courts. Finland server breach The first serious incident in NordVPN's history began in March 2018, when unidentified hackers managed to steal three private keys from one of Nord's data centers in Finland. Researchers didn't notice the leak until October 2019, well after the stolen keys had expired, but NordVPN's encryption was still technically vulnerable for several months. We say \"technically,\" because it was really only the outer layer of encryption — and even if they'd broken through it all, the hackers would only have seen browsing activity, not usernames, passwords or anything else sensitive. If anything, NordVPN's response actually makes us trust it more. It ended its relationship with the contractor who ran the Finnish data center and revamped its policies to eliminate the kind of negligence that led to the breach. Arguably, its only real error was not immediately disclosing the breach. NordVPN learned about the leak and started addressing it in May 2018, but the news didn't break until more than a year later. That timing probably made it look more suspicious than any actual mishandling did. Law enforcement compliance Another minor controversy erupted in 2022, when PCMag and other outlets reported that NordVPN had edited its website to say that it would comply with data requests from law enforcement. NordVPN responded with a new post that said nothing had changed: their policy was always to comply with lawful requests, which — provided the requests were lawfully submitted through a Panamanian court — is literally their only option. We're inclined to agree. VPNs are legal companies. They wouldn't last long if they openly declared their intent to break the law. The key is that when law enforcement comes calling, there shouldn't be anything to show them, as with the Turkish seizure of ExpressVPN. That's why verifiable no-logging policies are so important. Final verdict NordVPN is a great service on its own merits. It only suffers from having to be compared with the likes of ExpressVPN and Proton VPN. For example, its P2P servers are good for torrenting, but not as useful without Proton's port forwarding. It's fast, but speed tests fluctuated just a little more than Express. NordVPN's extra features are the best reason to pick it over its rivals. With Meshnet, you can theoretically set up a VPN connection anywhere in the world, and no other VPN has anything close to Meshnet's file transfer powers. Threat Protection Pro is also great if you can get it, adding file scanning to bolster the typical approach of just blocking suspicious DNS addresses. Specialty servers round out the offering, with double VPN maintaining good speeds with extra safety and Onion over VPN being among the safest ways to use Tor.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html?src=rss",
          "content": "When we say that NordVPN is a good VPN that's not quite great, it's important to put that in perspective. Building a good VPN is hard, as evidenced by all the shovelware VPNs flooding the market. NordVPN may not be perfect, but it's easily top-five caliber and excels in certain use cases. First, the bad: NordVPN's apps could all stand to undergo a little more quality control, with elements distracting from other elements and inconsistent designs from platform to platform. At least one of its FAQ pages directly contradicts itself. And while all the server locations could unblock Netflix, the one in Nigeria still showed U.S. content, indicating that our real location might have leaked. However, there's a lot of good to balance that out. Speeds are fantastic and we saw no other hint of any kind of leak. Its server network is expansive and not overly reliant on virtual locations. The vast majority of servers are ideal for unblocking foreign websites. The real draw, though, is the extra features, including the innovative and flexible Meshnet, plus a malware blocker that acts more like a full antivirus and forward-looking quantum resistant encryption. Editor's note (9/24/25): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews. Check out how we test VPNs to learn more about the new standards we're using.

Category Notes Installation and UI Connections happen quickly and features are easy to use on all platforms UI sometimes gets in the way; map screens can be clunky and apps come with unnecessary notifications Surprisingly, the best UI may be in the browser extension Speed Extremely fast download speeds with only a 6.4-percent average drop Good latencies on nearby servers, but farther ones have some lag Fast upload speeds, but losses spiked in a few locations Security Uses acceptable protocols with uncracked encryption NordWhisper obfuscated protocol recently implemented on Windows, Android and Linux No DNS, WebRTC or IPv6 leaks on five test servers Pricing Best plan is the 2-year Basic for $81.36, or $3.39 per month Basic gives you the complete VPN If you get a multi-year plan, be sure to manually renew in order to keep the promotional rates Bundles Plus tier adds advanced malware protection and NordPass password manager Complete plan adds NordLocker cloud storage Prime tier adds ID theft protection and insurance features Privacy policy NordVPN does not log user activity on the VPN, a policy backed up by several third-party audits However, it does log potentially identifiable device information unless you opt out in settings Some concerning liberties taken in the overall Nord policy, but no documented malfeasance Virtual location change Four out of five test servers unblocked Netflix three times running, including virtual India location Location in Nigeria got into Netflix, but didn't change available titles Server network 153 server locations in 117 countries and territories Server network is about 40 percent virtual, including all locations in Africa Features Extra servers grant additional privacy (double VPN, Onion over VPN, obfuscation) or specific optimizations (P2P, dedicated IP) Threat Protection blocks dangerous domains and the Pro upgrade has some antivirus capability Dark Web Monitor reports to you when any sensitive information has appeared on clandestine leak sites Presets let you activate several settings with one click Post-quantum encryption is nice, but not necessary yet Kill switch is a useful safety feature on all apps Split tunneling by app on Windows and Android, and by URL on browser extensions Customer support Written FAQs, live chat and email support Live chat connected to an expert human within a minute FAQs are poorly organized and contain some conflicts, but well-written on average Background check NordVPN is headquartered in Panama, while its parent company Nord Security is based in the Netherlands 2018 theft of public keys was a mistake, but NordVPN did almost everything right in response Claims of law enforcement collaboration are overblown — NordVPN will comply with requests, but that doesn't mean they'll have information to provide Installing, configuring and using NordVPN NordVPN's biggest strengths are its speeds and the range of options it puts at your fingertips. User experience is important, but it's not quite as front-and-center as it is with ExpressVPN and Proton VPN. Here's how the apps run on all the major platforms. Windows The Windows app is the first instance of NordVPN's UI being not bad enough to complain about, but not good enough to be considered excellent. The initial connection process is a little slow, and it's far easier to connect than it is to disconnect (click the power button while connected to shut the VPN off). The map takes up space that would have been better allocated to the server list. Sam Chapman for Engadget The minor problems continue in the settings list, which makes the mistake of not keeping all its tabs visible in the window — if you open one, you have to click back to the main menu to reach another page. The pages themselves are easy to use; it's just a bit clunkier than it could have been. Mac Setup is swift and easy on Mac, but the full NordVPN interface is a little awkward. The vast majority of the main window is taken up by a large map, which is mostly useless. There's no way to zoom out to see the whole world, and you can't choose between servers in each country unless you zoom way in. The server list on the left-hand side is almost always more useful. Sam Chapman for Engadget The preferences panel is better. All the tabs come with clear explanations of their function, and are laid out so the menu is always visible, unlike the Windows app. The gear icon at the bottom includes its own set of tabs that encompass most of the common functions, including changing your VPN protocol, activating the kill switch and setting the VPN to automatically connect on untrusted networks. Android NordVPN on mobile can be described in much the same way as its desktop apps: generally great, occasionally getting in its own way. On Android, the map screen is much more helpful. It's expandable to the entire world and allows you to choose between servers within a country. On the other hand, the important settings are buried in the Profile tab, and the app notifies you about your \"security score\" to pressure you into activating certain settings. Sam Chapman for Engadget To find the general settings page on Android, tap the bottom-right Profile tab and scroll down. Except for Threat Protection, which has its own tab on the main window, every feature is located here. It's probably necessary to keep the main app from getting cluttered, but still mildly frustrating. iOS The NordVPN iOS app resembles a compressed version of the macOS client, for better or worse. As with Android, most of its features are in the bottom-right Profile tab. It works well most of the time, but often feels slightly cumbersome. There's a bit too much on the screen, and a bit too much of the stuff has nothing to do with the VPN's core function. Sam Chapman for Engadget As an example, you can't log into your account within the app — you have to load your Nord account page in a web browser. Forced app switching is a design choice that truly needs to die. That said, VPN connections happen quickly. If you tend to simply leave your VPN active, you probably won't notice any of this stuff. Browser extensions Most VPN browser extensions consist of the same features on a smaller scale, and NordVPN's — on Chrome, Firefox and Edge — are no exception. They are important for one reason, though: they're the only way to split tunnels by URL and the only split tunneling at all on macOS and iOS. Despite being more compact, they're also easy to use, making for an excellent quick-start VPN solution. Sam Chapman for Engadget NordVPN speed test All VPNs slow down your average browsing speeds by adding extra steps into the connection process. When we test speed, we're looking for the VPN to drag as little as possible on your unprotected speeds. Download speed will be the most important stat for most users, since that determines how fast web pages load and how quickly videos can buffer. Latency is important for live connections like video chats, games and live streaming. Latency increases with distance — in the test below, data packets were sent to the remote server, then back to our home network. Upload speeds likewise influence your live two-way communications and are also vital for torrenting. Let's see how NordVPN performs on all three metrics. Server location Latency (ms) Increase factor Download speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Upload speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Unprotected (Portland, OR, USA) 22 -- 59.20 -- 5.86 -- Seattle, WA, USA (Fastest) 44 2x 57.21 3.4 5.62 4.1 New York, NY, USA 177 8x 56.90 3.9 5.60 4.4 Stockholm, Sweden 371 16.9x 55.94 5.5 5.63 3.9 Istanbul, Turkey 411 18.7x 53.02 10.4 5.78 5.9 Hong Kong 350 15.9x 56.18 5.1 5.72 2.4 Johannesburg, South Africa 602 27.4x 53.26 10.0 5.67 3.3 Average 326 14.8x 55.42 6.4 5.54 4.0 To summarize: NordVPN's download speeds are the fastest we've seen and its upload speeds and latency tie with the best. Downloads only dropped by an average of 6.4 percent across the globe and readings were mostly consistent — the servers in question performed much the same in each test. We even threw in Turkey and South Africa, two locations that commonly cause problems, but NordVPN still kept the drop to 10 percent. Sam Chapman for Engadget Latency is more a product of physical distance than VPN infrastructure, but you can still see differences between services. When tested on a similar range of locations, ExpressVPN and Proton VPN both kept average latencies under 300 ms. NordVPN's average came out to 326 milliseconds, though we should note that its latency increased less than Proton's on the closest server. Upload speeds declined an average of four percent, but there were a few anomalously high readings in Istanbul that skewed those numbers up. Without that location, NordVPN's upload rates would also have been the industry's current best. NordVPN security test No matter how well-built a VPN looks from the outside, there are several ways its security can fail. The most common problems are outdated protocols with weak encryption, failing to block IPv6 traffic or inadvertent leaks from sending DNS requests outside the encrypted tunnel. We'll start by looking for those common leak sources, then check whether NordVPN's encryption might be failing in less traceable ways. VPN protocols A VPN protocol is a set of rules used to get data quickly and safely from your device to a VPN server and back, even while that data is encrypted. Different protocols are connected with different encryption algorithms and can impact the speed, security and stability of your connection. When testing VPN security, the first step is to see if it's using any protocols like PPTP that are outdated and crackable, or homebrewed protocols with unclear security. NordVPN users have four options for protocols: OpenVPN, IKEv2 (not available on Mac or iOS), NordLynx and NordWhisper (available on Windows, Android and Linux only). Sam Chapman for Engadget OpenVPN and IKEv2 are both standard protocols you'll find on most VPN providers. Both use various strengths of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), with OpenVPN defaulting to AES-256 and IKEv2 to AES-128. OpenVPN can be set to UDP (faster but less stable) or TCP (more reliable but slower). So far, so secure. NordLynx is unique to NordVPN, but it's not that far off the beaten track — it's just WireGuard with extra security. WireGuard normally works by saving a stable IP address for each connection, which raises the very slight risk of exposing a user. NordLynx adds a second layer of abstraction that means those stable addresses are never revealed. Since NordVPN strongly recommends it for most situations, we used it for all our tests in this review. Finally, there's NordWhisper, a new protocol introduced in early 2025 that disguises your VPN traffic as normal web traffic to evade blanket web blocks. It's likely to be slower than the other protocols, so don't use it unless everything else has been blocked. We also don't recommend counting on it too much in general — large-scale censorship technology, like the Great Firewall of China, tends to rely on blocklists of known VPN servers, whose identity NordWhisper can't disguise. Leak test Our first order of business was to check five test servers to see if they leaked our real IP address — staying away from the ones in the speed test in order to get as comprehensive a picture of NordVPN's security as possible. With help from ipleak.net, we found all five to be free of the three major types of leaks. DNS leaks occur when a VPN sends DNS requests (in short, how your browser knows which websites to show you) outside its encrypted tunnel. By default, NordVPN uses its own private DNS servers, which our tests showed to effectively prevent leaks. WebRTC leaks are caused by real-time communication protocols sending information outside the VPN, which may reveal your real IP address. NordVPN is consistently successful at keeping WebRTC inside the tunnel, but you can have your browser block it if you're still worried. IPv6 leaks happen when a VPN only blocks IPv4 traffic and lets v6 through. NordVPN automatically blocks IPv6 traffic while it's active, so an IPv6 leak is all but impossible. Sam Chapman for Engadget Although that's all great news, it is still possible for leaks to occur without a clear explanation, so we ran one final test on NordVPN. Encryption test Wireshark is a program that captures detailed images of information sent over a device's internet connection. Even though our tests showed NordVPN to be free of leaks, we wanted to inspect it at the most granular level. Using WireShark, we recorded the traffic sent to an unencrypted HTTP site, before and after connecting to each NordVPN test server. Every server showed the same pattern: readable plaintext before, encrypted ciphertext after. If there is a security flaw remaining in NordVPN, it's unlikely to be relevant to the overwhelming majority of users. How much does NordVPN cost? NordVPN's pricing structure looks convoluted at first, but it's much simpler than it appears. A Basic subscription gets you full VPN functionality, and all the other tiers just add more features. If all you need is a VPN, you only need to concern yourself with the left side of the table below. The best deal for a Basic NordVPN subscription, which lets you connect to NordVPN with up to 10 devices at once, costs $81.36 for two years when you pay upfront ($3.39 per month). One year of the same plan costs $59.88 in advance ($4.99 per month) or $12.99 for one month at a time. The table below shows the complete cost; for more information on plans above Basic, see \"side apps and bundles\" in the next section. Plan 1-month cost 1-year cost 2-year cost Basic $12.99 $59.88 ($4.99/month) $81.36 ($3.39/month) Plus $13.99 $71.88 ($5.99/month) $105.36 ($4.39/month) Complete $14.99 $83.88 ($6.99/month) $129.36 ($5.39/month) Prime $17.99 $107.88 ($8.99/month) $177.36 ($7.39/month) The longer plans save money, but be careful: if you let them expire, you'll automatically renew at the more expensive one-year plan. Enough customers claim to have been auto-renewed at the higher rate that they've launched a class-action lawsuit against NordVPN, accusing the company of deceptive pricing practices and making renewals too difficult to cancel. A NordVPN PR rep said they could not comment on ongoing legal action, \"other than to state that we are and always have been very clear about the recurring nature of our services.\" No court date has been set so far. That said, there's a fairly straightforward workaround in the meantime: To prevent the auto renewal, log out of your NordVPN account, then sign up for a discounted plan again using the same email. As long as you do this before your subscription expires, your new account should link to your old one, keeping you subscribed at the introductory rate. Free trials and refunds Every NordVPN plan comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you cancel and request a refund before 30 days are up, you'll get the full cost back. The only way to try it for free without paying is to get the app on Android, where there's a seven-day trial through the Google Play Store. NordVPN side apps and bundles NordVPN is part of a larger family of Nord Security products, which you can save money on if you need more than one. We won't review all of them here, but for reference, here's everything you'll get from the higher subscription tiers. Basic: VPN on 10 devices, specialty servers, DNS ad-blocking, Meshnet Plus: All Basic features, plus malware scanning, extra scam blocking, tracker blocking, NordPass password manager, data breach scanner Complete: All Plus features, along with 1TB of NordLocker encrypted cloud storage Prime: All Complete features, plus NordProtect features like dark web monitoring, credit monitoring, ID theft insurance and extortion insurance Another tier called Ultra includes a subscription to Incogni, a data removal service run by Nord's partner Surfshark. The Ultra bundle is only available in certain countries, since NordVPN is still testing it; users outside the test countries can still add Incogni service at checkout. There also used to be a NordVPN family plan, but it seems to have been eliminated after Nord expanded the devices per subscription to 10. You can get a dedicated IP address on NordVPN to ensure you have the same IP every time you connect. This lets you configure remote firewalls to let you through while you're connected to the VPN. A dedicated IP costs $8.99 per month, $70.68 for a year ($5.89 per month) or $100.56 for two years ($4.19 per month). The NordVPN pricing page lists access to a Saily eSIM plan as a perk, though mysteriously, none of the existing plans seem to include it yet. A lot of VPNs are expanding into the eSIM space, so this may change soon. Close-reading NordVPN's privacy policy A VPN privacy policy isn't just empty words — it's a contract between the provider and its users. If a service openly defied its own policy, it could be sued for false advertising. VPNs tend to sneak loopholes into their privacy policies instead of flouting them outright; these loopholes can shed light on how the provider actually views your privacy. We combed through NordVPN's privacy policy to see whether it tries to take any such liberties. The policy has two parts: the general Nord Security policy and an addendum specific to NordVPN. General Nord privacy policy This policy applies to all Nord Security apps. It's impossible to create an account without a valid email address, but you can use a separate email masking service to make that anonymous. The policy also explicitly says that your email address will be added to a marketing mailing list, though you can opt out. Irritating, but not a privacy risk in itself. We're more concerned about the later statement that it may process data without the user's consent \"under the legal basis of our or third parties' legitimate interest.\" This clause covers some cases we'd agree are legitimate, such as identifying people who launch cyberattacks from NordVPN servers. But Nord also considers it \"legitimate interest\" to process your personal data \"to improve or maintain our services and provide new products and features.\" Reached for comment, a NordVPN representative said that using personal data in this way \"generally involves aggregated, depersonalized or technical information.\" That's somewhat reassuring, but the \"generally\" leaves a bit too much wiggle room. Ideally, we'd prefer that personal data exist wholly in the \"consent only\" section. The section on sharing your data with third parties only lists \"some of\" the service providers who may receive your information. Among these are Google Analytics, which is known to store personal data on U.S. servers — all of which are potential security risks in the age of DOGE. Other unnamed \"third parties\" are involved in targeting ads at users of Nord websites. The NordVPN representative said that \"since some partners, such as payment processors, can vary by region or specific service and may change over time depending on our operational needs, we do not publish a fixed list.\" They added that all third parties are \"contractually required to handle personal data in accordance with applicable laws and industry standards.\" We aren't using this to condemn Nord; many of these practices are fairly standard in the VPN industry. But it's important to know about all the potential leakage points before trusting your deepest secrets to any company. NordVPN specific policies The NordVPN privacy policy doesn't add much atop the general Nord notice. It does track session activity connected to your username to make sure you're staying within the 10-device limit, but it automatically deletes these logs 15 minutes after you disconnect. The logs also don't include your IP address or the addresses of VPN servers you used. Sam Chapman for Engadget The only real problem we found is that NordVPN apps collect information about your activity on the app by default. This doesn't include information about your browsing habits, but it does include unique traits that could conceivably be used for \"device fingerprinting\" — in which a third party can deduce a user's identity through clues about their device. You can turn this off in the General settings. A NordVPN spokesperson told us that the data collected is \"not personally identifiable,\" and that the company takes \"deliberate steps to strip out anything that could be linked back to a specific person.\" This presumably means the data is aggregated so it only shows general trends, not any one device's activity. That's a lot less risky, but we still recommend switching the setting off. Third-party privacy audits NordVPN has passed five independent audits of its privacy policy so far, most recently from Deloitte in late 2024. Annoyingly, you can only read the entire report by logging into a Nord account, but it at least doesn't have to be a paid account. The audit found that NordVPN was following its own no-logs policy. Specifically, the Deloitte Lithuania investigators concluded that \"the configuration of IT systems and management of the supporting IT operations is properly prepared, in all material respects in accordance with the NordVPN's description set out in the Appendix I.\" (Appendix I of the report is identical to NordVPN's privacy policy.) Can NordVPN change your virtual location? You'll be most interested in this section if you mainly use a VPN to change their location for streaming. To see if NordVPN could unlock new streaming libraries, we picked a new batch of five test servers, then logged onto Netflix. Since Netflix tries to block all VPN servers to prevent copyright issues, our first question was whether we'd get through at all. Our second question: would connecting to a NordVPN server actually change what Netflix library we saw? It should, given that NordVPN seems leak-proof, but thoroughness demands we check anyway. Here's what we found. Server location Netflix unblocked? Content changed? Canada Yes Yes Argentina Yes Yes Germany Yes Yes India Yes Yes Nigeria Yes No Four out of five locations worked perfectly. On a Canadian server, we were able to stream Star Trek: The Next Generation, which left American Netflix years ago. The Argentine server gave us access to something called Pasion de Gavilanes, which we'd never heard of but sounds great. Sam Chapman for Engadget The only problem was Nigeria. We tested it several times, connected to multiple different Nigerian locations, but saw our American Netflix library every time. We then ran a leak test on Nigeria, which wasn't one of our security test locations, and found it to be working normally. It's hard to say what happened, especially since the Nigeria server doesn't appear to be virtual, but we can confirm that it wasn't working. Investigating NordVPN's server network NordVPN has servers in 153 cities in 117 countries. Out of all total options, 62 are virtual locations (about 40 percent), where the server is really located somewhere else. This makes it possible to get servers into more places, but depending on your actual location relative to the server, it may perform differently than you expect. Sam Chapman for Engadget Virtual locations have allowed NordVPN's server network to grow quite extensive, with lots more locations in South America, Africa and Asia than the industry standard. Check out the distribution in the table. Region Countries and territories with servers Total server locations Total virtual server locations North America 15 36 12 South America 10 10 6 Europe 48 57 11 Africa 10 10 10 Middle East 7 7 4 Asia 24 26 18 Oceania 3 7 1 Total 117 153 62 (40.5 percent) The relatively low proportion of virtual locations (nearly identical to that of ExpressVPN) is a good sign, as it means NordVPN has been growing its server network thoughtfully. Some VPNs — looking at you, HMA — inflate their server lists as a marketing point without seriously considering what it takes to maintain such a large network. That thankfully doesn't seem to be the case here. Extra features of NordVPN Here's everything you get with a NordVPN app other than the VPN itself. There's a lot going on here, so we'll limit ourselves to a sketch of each feature. Specialty servers As soon as you load NordVPN, you'll see a list of special servers near the top of the right-hand column. We'll go over each of them in order. Dedicated IP: As discussed in the bundles section, a dedicated IP address costs extra. With this, you'll always connect with the same IP, which is private to you alone. It may be worth the price if you find yourself getting asked for CAPTCHAs a lot more while connected to NordVPN — though for what it's worth, that didn't happen to us. Double VPN: This sends your connection through a second VPN server before it reaches your ISP. The second server is your apparent location. There are 10 endpoints to choose from. As you might imagine, your internet will run slower with two VPN servers in the mix, so only use this if you seriously need security. Obfuscated servers: These are only available on OpenVPN. Obfuscation can help you get around firewalls that seek out and block VPN traffic. If you can't get online with NordVPN when you're on a certain network, obfuscated servers might work. Onion Over VPN: After encrypting your data as normal, these servers send it through several nodes of the Tor network, granting you the total anonymity of onion routing while keeping you safe from malicious relays. It's available in two locations, Netherlands and Switzerland, and — like double VPN — is best used only when you need the utmost privacy. P2P: NordVPN only allows torrenting on its peer-to-peer servers, but fortunately, it's got P2P servers in 114 countries — only three fewer than it has in total. NordVPN keeps your download and upload speeds very fast on average, so you shouldn't have trouble torrenting from any location. Meshnet Meshnet is NordVPN's most unique and exciting feature by a long shot. By logging into the same NordVPN account on multiple devices, you can connect those devices directly through a NordLynx tunnel without needing a NordVPN server in between. Sam Chapman for Engadget Essentially, you're using your own devices as VPN servers — obviously not great for privacy, but amazing for accessing web services in other countries. While two devices are connected, you can transfer files between them through the NordLynx tunnel. You can even invite friends and use their devices. Threat Protection NordVPN has two levels of antivirus: Threat Protection and Threat Protection Pro. The former is a simple DNS filter that stops your browsing from loading unsafe web pages while NordVPN is active. It's the highest level available on Android, iOS and Linux, or on any Basic subscription. Sam Chapman for Engadget Threat Protection Pro, which Plus subscribers or higher can set up on Windows and Mac, can work even when you aren't connected to a NordVPN server. It acts more like a standalone antivirus by scanning downloaded files for malware, and can even block trackers. Basic Threat Protection (without Pro) can block some trackers by filtering out domains known to use them, but doesn't block the trackers directly. Dark Web Monitor While active, Dark Web Monitor continually searches known data breach dump sites on the dark web and notifies you if it ever finds your account email address. If you get that notification, change any passwords associated with the address. With a Prime subscription, you can also have it search for your phone number, social security number or other financial information. Presets Presets let you set up one-click VPN connections with a desired group of settings, a lot like Proton VPN's Profiles. NordVPN comes pre-loaded with presets that optimize for \"Downloads,\" \"Speed\" and \"Browsing,\" which sounds to us like the same thing three times. More usefully, you can create presets for particular countries, then add website shortcuts that will appear once you've connected. You could, for example, set one that connects to a specific location, then add a shortcut to a streaming site available in that location. Post-Quantum encryption Experts widely believe that quantum computers will eventually make our current encryption algorithms obsolete, but there's almost no consensus on when that will actually happen — except that it hasn't happened yet. Knowing that, NordVPN's \"post-quantum encryption\" feature comes across as a bit premature, but it's reassuring that someone is thinking about it. Having said that, we don't recommend using post-quantum encryption yet. It works by layering one of the known quantum-proof encryption standards on top of a standard NordLynx session, which makes your VPN connection slower and more erratic. Until we can verify a real quantum cyberattack, post-quantum encryption is a needless precaution. Kill switch A kill switch cuts off your internet the instant you lose your connection to a NordVPN server. This protects you in case a server unexpectedly fails, and as a side benefit, prevents you from connecting to any fake VPN servers. You should keep the kill switch on at all times. Split tunneling Split tunneling is available on NordVPN's Windows and Android apps (and Android TV by extension), along with its browser extensions. On Windows and Android, it splits by app: you can determine which apps get online through the VPN and which go unprotected. The browser extensions let you split by URL, so the VPN only protects certain sites. NordVPN customer support options NordVPN's apps link directly to its online help center. As always, we went in with a specific question in mind: whether the basic level of Threat Protection could block trackers, and if so, what kind. We found the categories on the written support page difficult to parse, especially the troubleshooting section — would the average user appreciate the difference between \"app issues,\" \"connection issues\" and \"errors\"? We correctly guessed that our question would be under \"Using NordVPN -> Features,\" but the introductory article on Threat Protection and Threat Protection Pro was buried at the bottom of the list. Unfortunately, that made things more confusing, as this article says that Threat Protection (not Pro) both does and doesn't block trackers. In NordVPN's favor, however, using the search bar brought us instantly back to that article without any confusion. The live support experience Using NordVPN's live chat was a smooth and reassuring experience. From the time we decided to ask directly, it took us less than a minute to connect with a real person, who quickly cleared up the confusion and promised to update the confusing support page (we'll check back to see if they actually do). Sam Chapman for Engadget One other option is an email support form, which can be found both on the website and in the help sections of NordVPN apps. This is best for complex problems that require screenshots to explain, and promises a response within 24 hours. NordVPN background check NordVPN was founded in 2012. Launching with its desktop apps, it moved to iOS and Android in 2016, then added apps for browser extensions and smart TVs. Its developer, Nord Security, has no parent company, and its history is relatively uncontroversial. We've documented two notable incidents below, plus more about Nord Security's operations. Headquarters and ownership Nord Security was founded in Lithuania, and maintains offices there. Although Nord Security is registered in Amsterdam, NordVPN operates under a separate license in Panama, which makes any data requests subject to Panama's courts. Finland server breach The first serious incident in NordVPN's history began in March 2018, when unidentified hackers managed to steal three private keys from one of Nord's data centers in Finland. Researchers didn't notice the leak until October 2019, well after the stolen keys had expired, but NordVPN's encryption was still technically vulnerable for several months. We say \"technically,\" because it was really only the outer layer of encryption — and even if they'd broken through it all, the hackers would only have seen browsing activity, not usernames, passwords or anything else sensitive. If anything, NordVPN's response actually makes us trust it more. It ended its relationship with the contractor who ran the Finnish data center and revamped its policies to eliminate the kind of negligence that led to the breach. Arguably, its only real error was not immediately disclosing the breach. NordVPN learned about the leak and started addressing it in May 2018, but the news didn't break until more than a year later. That timing probably made it look more suspicious than any actual mishandling did. Law enforcement compliance Another minor controversy erupted in 2022, when PCMag and other outlets reported that NordVPN had edited its website to say that it would comply with data requests from law enforcement. NordVPN responded with a new post that said nothing had changed: their policy was always to comply with lawful requests, which — provided the requests were lawfully submitted through a Panamanian court — is literally their only option. We're inclined to agree. VPNs are legal companies. They wouldn't last long if they openly declared their intent to break the law. The key is that when law enforcement comes calling, there shouldn't be anything to show them, as with the Turkish seizure of ExpressVPN. That's why verifiable no-logging policies are so important. Final verdict NordVPN is a great service on its own merits. It only suffers from having to be compared with the likes of ExpressVPN and Proton VPN. For example, its P2P servers are good for torrenting, but not as useful without Proton's port forwarding. It's fast, but speed tests fluctuated just a little more than Express. NordVPN's extra features are the best reason to pick it over its rivals. With Meshnet, you can theoretically set up a VPN connection anywhere in the world, and no other VPN has anything close to Meshnet's file transfer powers. Threat Protection Pro is also great if you can get it, adding file scanning to bolster the typical approach of just blocking suspicious DNS addresses. Specialty servers round out the offering, with double VPN maintaining good speeds with extra safety and Onion over VPN being among the safest ways to use Tor.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "The Steam Machine is back from the dead. Not as a Valve-supported program for manufacturers to create living room PCs, but instead a home console sibling to the Steam Deck. Valve introduced its second attempt at ruling the living room in a surprise hardware announcement in November 2025, and paired the new Steam Machine with a new Steam Controller and a wireless VR headset it calls the Steam Frame. Since the announcement, as is often the case with Valve, some details remain elusive, however.While we wait for the release of the company's new hardware lineup in 2026, and more information straight from the horse's mouth, here's everything we know about the hardware, software and price of the Steam Machine.What's the Steam Machine's hardware like?ValveLike the Steam Deck, the Steam Machine is utilitarian and bespoke. The PC is a black, 5.98 x 6.39 x 6.14 inch (152 x 162.4 x 156mm) box, with ports and a grille for a fan in the back and a removable faceplate and customizable LED light strip in the front. Inside, Valve says the Steam Machine features a \"semi-custom\" AMD Zen 4 CPU with six cores and up to 4.8GHz clock speeds, and a \"semi-custom\" RDNA3 AMD GPU, along with 16GB DDR RAM, 8GB GDDR6 VRAM and either 512GB or 2TB of storage.While these specs make the Steam Machine more powerful than the aging Steam Deck (which shipped in 2022 with its own custom AMD chip) Valve has been careful not to oversell the capabilities of the box. In a blog post, the company said that \"the majority of Steam titles play great at 4K 60FPS\" using AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) frame generation and upscaling technology, but some titles require more upscaling than others, and it \"may be preferable to play at a lower framerate with [variable refresh rate] to maintain a 1080p internal resolution.\"In a hands-on preview of the Steam Machine, Digital Foundry expressed concern with what Valve's claims and the device's stated specs could mean for future performance. \"The decision to opt for 8GB of GDDR6 memory has been proven to be a limiting factor on many modern mainstream triple-A games and falls short of the maximum VRAM pools and memory bandwidth available on both Xbox Series X and base PS5,\" Digital Foundry writes.The Steam Machine supports Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 6E and includes an integrated 2.4GHz adapter for the new Steam Controller. In terms of port selection, there's DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 inputs for connecting the box to external monitors and TVs, four USB-A ports (divided between two USB 2.0 ports and two USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports) and one USB-C port on the back.Engadget will have to try out the Steam Machine to really know what it's capable of, but there's nothing to suggest it couldn't be as flexible as the Steam Deck, especially with more power to play with. What games will be able to run on the Steam Machine?ValveAny game that runs on SteamOS, Valve's Linux-based operating system, will run on the Steam Machine, provided the device's technical specs will support it. For games running natively on Linux, the Steam Machine will download the Linux version. For Windows games and everything else, it'll be able to use Steam's built-in Proton compatibility layer to translate games to Linux, just like the Steam Deck does.Proton is developed by both Valve and CodeWeavers, the team behind the macOS compatibility app CrossOver. Valve's compatibility layer translates a game's API calls and other software features into something Linux understands, essentially tricking the game into thinking it's running on Windows when it isn't. Proton has worked remarkably well so far, in some cases helping some PC games run more efficiently on Linux than they do on Windows, but it does have some limitations. Because some anti-cheat software doesn't support Linux, many competitive multiplayer games aren't playable on SteamOS. Valve hopes the Steam Machine will help change that. \"While [the] Steam Machine also requires dev participation to enable anti-cheat, we think the incentives for enabling anti-cheat on Machine to be higher than on Deck as we expect more people to play multiplayer games on it,\" Valve told Eurogamer. \"Ultimately we hope that the launch of Machine will change the equation around anti-cheat support and increase its support.\"To help users find what games work well on the Steam Machine, Valve plans to expand its program for verifying games on the Steam Deck to include the Steam Machine and Steam Frame. Valve looks at things like controller support, the default resolution of the game, whether or not it requires a separate launcher and whether the game and its middleware work with Proton to determine a game's rating. Then the company sorts games into four categories: Verified (where the game works with Steam hardware at launch), Playable (where a user might have to make modifications to run smoothly), Unplayable (where some or all of the game doesn't function) and Unknown. According to an announcement Valve sent to developers, games that were Verified for the Steam Deck will automatically be verified for the Steam Machine. The system is helpful, but far from definitive — some Unplayable games are in fact playable — which is why online, community-run databases like ProtonDB fill in the gaps with more granular information.How much will the Steam Machine cost and when will it launch?ValveValve hasn't announced a price or a release date for the Steam Machine or any of its new hardware. In terms of price, however, the company has suggested it might not be a deal in quite the same way the $399 Steam Deck LCD was. Valve designer Pierre-Loup Griffais told The Verge that the \"Steam Machine’s pricing is comparable to a PC with similar specs\" and that its price would be \"positioned closer to the entry level of the PC space\" but be \"very competitive with what you a PC you could build yourself from parts.\"That means the Steam Machine will likely cost more than the $499 PS5, and that the rising costs of memory could make it even more expensive. Valve has already publicly admitted that memory and storage shortages are affecting its plans. In February, the company said that it was delaying the launch of its hardware (though it still hopes to ship in the first half of 2026) and rethinking pricing, particularly around the Steam Machine and Steam Frame, because of the \"limited availability and growing prices\" of critical components like RAM.The changes Framework had to make to the pricing of the Framework Desktop are an illustrative example of the position Valve is in. Framework pitched its compact desktop PC as being great for gaming, with an AMD Ryzen AI Max chip (originally meant for gaming laptops) and a minimum of 32GB of RAM that lets it run games at 1440p. The company originally sold the base configuration of the Framework Desktop for $1,099, but announced in January 2026 that it would now cost $1,139 due to the rising cost of RAM. The price situation got even worse for configurations with more RAM. A Framework Desktop with 128GB of RAM now costs $2,459.The blame for rising costs lies squarely with the AI industry, whose demand for RAM has led to the collapse of consumer RAM brands and a dearth of true deals on the in-demand component. At this point, PC makers have no solution to the problem other than riding the shortage out and raising prices. Valve clearly isn't immune to those same issues.That doesn't rule out the company offering its Linux PC at multiple different price points, or in some kind of bundle deal with multiple pieces of new Steam hardware. But it does mean that the Steam Machine will likely be priced like a premium device. Same for the Steam Controller and Steam Frame. In the case of the Frame, UploadVR reports that Valve wants to sell the headset for less than the $1,000 Valve Index, but that doesn't mean it won't be significantly more expensive than the $300 Meta Quest 3S.What accessories will work with the Steam Machine?ValveThe Steam Machine is designed to work with a variety of different Bluetooth controllers and other wireless accessories, and also whatever you can plug into its multiple USB-A ports and single USB-C port. With a built-in 2.4GHz Steam Controller dongle inside the Steam Machine, Valve's controller should be an ideal option for controlling games, particularly because of its multiple control options, like touchpads and gyroscopes. Support for Steam Link, Valve's tech for streaming PC games over local wireless, means you can also send games from a Steam Machine to the Steam Deck, Steam Frame or the Steam Link app and play them there.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/everything-we-know-about-valves-new-steam-machine-200458817.html?src=rss",

Similar to OpenAI's Sora app, Vibes lets users prompt Meta AI to create TikTok-style vertical videos.\"Following the strong early traction of Vibes within Meta AI, we are testing a standalone app to build on that momentum,\" Meta said in a statement. \"We’ve seen that users are increasingly leaning into the format to create, discover, and share AI-generated video with friends. This standalone app provides a dedicated home for that experience, offering people a more focused and immersive environment. We will look to expand the app further based on what we learn from the community.\"Meta has yet to share specific numbers for how many people actually use Vibes, but the company does claim that Meta AI usage has continued to grow since Vibes launched. Breaking the feature out into its own app could allow Meta to add more functionality without cluttering the existing Meta AI app. The company believes AI-generated content will be the next big source of engagement on platforms, and said in an October 2025 earnings call that it planned to push more AI images and videos into its recommendation algorithm. A dedicated app for creating videos like Vibes could be one way Meta hopes to do that.As Meta's main competitor in the burgeoning field of AI-first social media, OpenAI has continued to iterate on its Sora app, adding ways for characters and pets to cameo in videos, and signing a deal with Disney to allow users to generate content with Disney characters. Considering the company has licensed celebrity likenesses in the past, it doesn't seem impossible that Meta could pursue similar deals. Whatever happens, AI-generated videos appear like they'll be increasingly inescapable.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-is-giving-its-ai-slop-feed-an-app-of-its-own-192208200.html?src=rss",

          "title": "OpenAI’s GPT-5.3-Codex drops as Anthropic upgrades Claude — AI coding wars heat up ahead of Super Bowl ads",
          "standfirst": "OpenAI on Wednesday released GPT-5.3-Codex, which the company calls its most capable coding agent to date, in an announcement timed to land at the exact same moment Anthropic unveiled its own flagship model upgrade, Claude Opus 4.6. The synchronized launches mark the opening salvo in what industry observers are calling the AI coding wars — a high-stakes battle to capture the enterprise software development market.The dueling announcements came amid an already heated week between the two AI giants, who are also set to air competing Super Bowl advertisements on Sunday, and whose executives have been trading barbs publicly over business models, access, and corporate ethics.\"I love building with this model; it feels like more of a step forward than the benchmarks suggest,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X minutes after the launch. He later added: \"It was amazing to watch how much faster we were able to ship 5.3-Codex by using 5.3-Codex, and for sure this is a sign of things to come.\"That claim — that the model helped build itself — is a significant milestone in AI development. According to OpenAI&#x27;s announcement, the Codex team used early versions of GPT-5.3-Codex to debug its own training runs, manage deployment infrastructure, and diagnose test results and evaluations. The company describes it as \"our first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\"OpenAI&#x27;s new coding model posts record-breaking benchmark scores, outpacing Anthropic&#x27;s Claude by double digitsThe new model posts substantial gains across multiple industry benchmarks. GPT-5.3-Codex achieves 57% on SWE-Bench Pro, a rigorous evaluation of real-world software engineering that spans four programming languages and tests contamination-resistant, industrially relevant challenges. It scores 77.3% on Terminal-Bench 2.0, which measures the terminal skills essential for coding agents, and 64% on OSWorld, an agentic computer-use benchmark where models must complete productivity tasks in visual desktop environments.The Terminal-Bench 2.0 result is particularly striking. According to performance data released Wednesday, GPT-5.3-Codex scored 77.3% compared to GPT-5.2-Codex&#x27;s 64.0% and the base GPT-5.2 model&#x27;s 62.2% — a 13-percentage-point leap in a single generation. One user on X noted that the score \"absolutely demolished\" Anthropic&#x27;s Opus 4.6, which reportedly achieved 65.4% on the same benchmark.OpenAI also claims the model accomplishes these results with dramatically improved efficiency: less than half the tokens of its predecessor for equivalent tasks, plus more than 25% faster inference per token.\"Notably, GPT-5.3-Codex does so with fewer tokens than any prior model, letting users simply build more,\" the company stated in its announcement.From coding assistant to computer operator: GPT-5.3-Codex aims to automate the entire software development lifecyclePerhaps more significant than the benchmark improvements is OpenAI&#x27;s positioning of GPT-5.3-Codex as a model that transcends pure coding. The company explicitly states that \"Codex goes from an agent that can write and review code to an agent that can do nearly anything developers and professionals can do on a computer.\"This expanded capability set includes debugging, deploying, monitoring, writing product requirement documents, editing copy, conducting user research, building slide decks, and analyzing data in spreadsheet applications. The model shows strong performance on GDPVal, an OpenAI evaluation released in 2025 that measures performance on well-specified knowledge-work tasks across 44 occupations.The expansion signals OpenAI&#x27;s ambition to capture not just the developer tools market but the broader enterprise productivity software space — a market that includes established players like Microsoft, Salesforce, and ServiceNow, all of whom are racing to embed AI agents into their platforms.OpenAI&#x27;s first &#x27;high capability&#x27; cybersecurity model prompts new safety protocols and a $10 million defense fundThe pivot toward general-purpose computing brings new security considerations. In a notable disclosure, OpenAI revealed that GPT-5.3-Codex is the first model it classifies as \"High capability\" for cybersecurity-related tasks under its Preparedness Framework, and the first directly trained to identify software vulnerabilities.\"While we don&#x27;t have definitive evidence it can automate cyber attacks end-to-end, we&#x27;re taking a precautionary approach and deploying our most comprehensive cybersecurity safety stack to date,\" the company stated. Mitigations include dual-use safety training, automated monitoring, trusted access for advanced capabilities, and enforcement pipelines incorporating threat intelligence.Altman highlighted this development on X: \"This is our first model that hits &#x27;high&#x27; for cybersecurity on our preparedness framework. We are piloting a Trusted Access framework, and committing $10 million in API credits to accelerate cyber defense.\"The company is also expanding the private beta of Aardvark, its security research agent, and partnering with open-source maintainers to provide free codebase scanning for widely used projects. OpenAI cited Next.js as an example where a security researcher used Codex to discover vulnerabilities disclosed last week.Super Bowl showdown: Sam Altman calls Anthropic&#x27;s advertising campaign &#x27;clearly dishonest&#x27; as rivalry turns personalThe cybersecurity announcement, however, has been overshadowed by the increasingly personal nature of the OpenAI-Anthropic rivalry. The timing of Wednesday&#x27;s release cannot be understood without the context of OpenAI&#x27;s intensifying competition with Anthropic, the AI safety-focused startup founded in 2021 by former OpenAI researchers, including Dario and Daniela Amodei.Both companies scheduled major product announcements for 10 a.m. Pacific Time today. Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4.6, which it describes as its \"smartest model\" that \"plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, operates reliably in massive codebases, and catches its own mistakes.”The head-to-head timing follows a week of escalating tensions. Anthropic announced it will air Super Bowl advertisements mocking OpenAI&#x27;s recent decision to begin testing ads within ChatGPT for free users. Altman responded with unusual directness, calling the advertisements \"funny\" but \"clearly dishonest\" in an extensive X post.\"We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that,\" Altman wrote. \"I guess it&#x27;s on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren&#x27;t real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.\"He went further, characterizing Anthropic as an \"authoritarian company\" that \"wants to control what people do with AI.\"\"Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people,\" Altman wrote. \"More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do.\"Enterprise AI spending surges past projections as OpenAI&#x27;s market share faces pressure from Anthropic and GoogleThe public sparring masks a deadly serious business competition. The rivalry plays out against a backdrop of explosive enterprise AI adoption, where both companies are fighting for position in a rapidly expanding market.According to survey data from Andreessen Horowitz released this week, enterprise spending on large language models has dramatically outpaced even bullish projections. Average enterprise LLM spending reached $7 million in 2025, 180% higher than 2024&#x27;s actual spending of $2.5 million — and 56% above what enterprises had projected for 2025 just a year earlier. Spending is projected to reach $11.6 million per enterprise in 2026, a further 65% increase.The a16z data reveals shifting market dynamics that help explain the intensity of the competition. OpenAI maintains the largest average share of enterprise AI wallet, but that share is shrinking — from 62% in 2024 to a projected 53% in 2026. Anthropic&#x27;s share, meanwhile, has grown from 14% to a projected 18% over the same period, with Google showing similar gains.Enterprise adoption patterns tell a more nuanced story. While OpenAI leads in overall usage, only 46% of surveyed OpenAI customers are using its most capable models in production, compared to 75% for Anthropic and 76% for Google. When including testing environments, 89% of Anthropic customers are testing or using the company&#x27;s most capable models — the highest rate among major providers.For software development specifically — one of the primary use cases for both companies&#x27; coding agents — the a16z survey shows OpenAI with approximately 35% market share, with Anthropic claiming a substantial and growing portion of the remainder.Both AI labs race to become the enterprise operating system of choice, moving beyond models to full-stack platformsThese market dynamics explain why both companies are positioning themselves as platforms rather than mere model providers. OpenAI on Wednesday also launched Frontier, a new platform designed to serve as a comprehensive hub for businesses adopting a range of AI tools — including those developed by third parties — that can operate together seamlessly.\"We can be the partner of choice for AI transformation for enterprise. The sky is the limit in terms of revenue we can generate from a platform like that,\" Fidji Simo, OpenAI&#x27;s CEO of applications, told reporters this week.This follows Monday&#x27;s launch of the Codex desktop application for macOS, which OpenAI says has already surpassed 500,000 downloads. The app enables users to manage multiple AI coding agents simultaneously — a capability that becomes increasingly important as enterprises deploy agents for complex, long-running tasks.Trillion-dollar compute obligations and $350 billion valuations reveal the massive financial stakes driving the AI coding raceThe platform ambitions require extraordinary capital. The dueling launches underscore the staggering financial requirements of frontier AI development, with both companies burning through billions while racing to establish market dominance.Anthropic is currently in discussions for a funding round that could bring in more than $20 billion at a valuation of at least $350 billion, according to Bloomberg, and is simultaneously planning an employee tender offer at that valuation.OpenAI, meanwhile, has disclosed that it owes more than $1 trillion in financial obligations to backers — including Oracle, Microsoft, and Nvidia — that are essentially fronting compute costs in expectation of future returns.GPT-5.3-Codex was \"co-designed for, trained with, and served on NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems,\" according to OpenAI&#x27;s announcement—a reference to Nvidia&#x27;s latest Blackwell-generation AI supercomputing architecture.The financial pressure adds urgency to both companies&#x27; enterprise strategies. Unlike established tech giants with diversified revenue streams, both Anthropic and OpenAI must prove they can generate sufficient revenue from AI products to justify their extraordinary valuations and infrastructure costs.OpenAI promises more Codex features in coming weeks as 500,000 users download the new desktop appLooking ahead, OpenAI says GPT-5.3-Codex is available immediately for paid ChatGPT users across all Codex surfaces: the desktop app, command-line interface, IDE extensions, and web interface. API access is expected to follow.The model includes a new interactivity feature: users can choose between \"pragmatic\" or \"friendly\" personalities — a customization Altman suggests users feel strongly about. More substantively, the model provides frequent progress updates during tasks, allowing users to interact in real time, ask questions, discuss approaches, and steer toward solutions without losing context.\"Instead of waiting for a final output, you can interact in real time,\" OpenAI stated. \"GPT-5.3-Codex talks through what it&#x27;s doing, responds to feedback, and keeps you in the loop from start to finish.\"The company promises more capabilities in the coming weeks, with Altman declaring: \"I believe Codex is going to win.\"He concluded his response to Anthropic with a philosophical statement that frames the competition in stark terms: \"This time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them.\"Whether that message resonates with enterprise customers — who according to a16z data cite trust, security, and compliance as their top concerns — remains to be seen. What&#x27;s clear is that the AI coding wars have begun in earnest, and neither company intends to cede ground.",

          "title": "Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.6 brings 1M token context and 'agent teams' to take on OpenAI's Codex",
          "standfirst": "Anthropic on Thursday released Claude Opus 4.6, a major upgrade to its flagship artificial intelligence model that the company says plans more carefully, sustains longer autonomous workflows, and outperforms competitors including OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.2 on key enterprise benchmarks — a release that arrives at a tumultuous moment for the AI industry and global software markets.The launch comes just three days after OpenAI released its own Codex desktop application in a direct challenge to Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Code momentum, and amid a $285 billion rout in software and services stocks that investors attribute partly to fears that Anthropic&#x27;s AI tools could disrupt established enterprise software businesses.For the first time, Anthropic&#x27;s Opus-class models will feature a 1 million token context window, allowing the AI to process and reason across vastly more information than previous versions. The company also introduced \"agent teams\" in Claude Code — a research preview feature that enables multiple AI agents to work simultaneously on different aspects of a coding project, coordinating autonomously.\"We&#x27;re focused on building the most capable, reliable, and safe AI systems,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told VentureBeat about the announcements. \"Opus 4.6 is even better at planning, helping solve the most complex coding tasks. And the new agent teams feature means users can split work across multiple agents — one on the frontend, one on the API, one on the migration — each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others.\"Why OpenAI and Anthropic are locked in an all-out war for enterprise developersThe release intensifies an already fierce competition between Anthropic and OpenAI, the two most valuable privately held AI companies in the world. OpenAI on Monday released a new desktop application for its Codex artificial intelligence coding system, a tool the company says transforms software development from a collaborative exercise with a single AI assistant into something more akin to managing a team of autonomous workers.AI coding assistants have exploded in popularity over the last year, and OpenAI said more than 1 million developers have used Codex in the past month. The new Codex app is part of OpenAI&#x27;s ongoing effort to lure users and market share away from rivals like Anthropic and Cursor.The timing of Anthropic&#x27;s release — just 72 hours after OpenAI&#x27;s Codex launch — underscores the breakneck pace of competition in AI development tools. OpenAI faces intensifying competition from Anthropic, which posted the largest share increase of any frontier lab since May 2025, according to a recent Andreessen Horowitz survey. Forty-four percent of enterprises now use Anthropic in production, driven by rapid capability gains in software development since late 2024. The desktop launch is a strategic counter to Claude Code&#x27;s momentum.According to Anthropic&#x27;s announcement, Opus 4.6 achieves the highest score on Terminal-Bench 2.0, an agentic coding evaluation, and leads all other frontier models on Humanity&#x27;s Last Exam, a complex multi-discipline reasoning test. On GDPval-AA — a benchmark measuring performance on economically valuable knowledge work tasks in finance, legal and other domains — Opus 4.6 outperforms OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.2 by approximately 144 ELO points, which translates to obtaining a higher score approximately 70% of the time.Inside Claude Code&#x27;s $1 billion revenue milestone and growing enterprise footprintThe stakes are substantial. Asked about Claude Code&#x27;s financial performance, the Anthropic spokesperson noted that in November, the company announced that Claude Code reached $1 billion in run rate revenue only six months after becoming generally available in May 2025.The spokesperson highlighted major enterprise deployments: \"Claude Code is used by Uber across teams like software engineering, data science, finance, and trust and safety; wall-to-wall deployment across Salesforce&#x27;s global engineering org; tens of thousands of devs at Accenture; and companies across industries like Spotify, Rakuten, Snowflake, Novo Nordisk, and Ramp.\"That enterprise traction has translated into skyrocketing valuations. Earlier this month, Anthropic signed a term sheet for a $10 billion funding round at a $350 billion valuation. Bloomberg reported that Anthropic is simultaneously working on a tender offer that would allow employees to sell shares at that valuation, offering liquidity to staffers who have watched the company&#x27;s worth multiply since its 2021 founding.How Opus 4.6 solves the &#x27;context rot&#x27; problem that has plagued AI modelsOne of Opus 4.6&#x27;s most significant technical improvements addresses what the AI industry calls \"context rot\"—the degradation of model performance as conversations grow longer. Anthropic says Opus 4.6 scores 76% on MRCR v2, a needle-in-a-haystack benchmark testing a model&#x27;s ability to retrieve information hidden in vast amounts of text, compared to just 18.5% for Sonnet 4.5.\"This is a qualitative shift in how much context a model can actually use while maintaining peak performance,\" the company said in its announcement.The model also supports outputs of up to 128,000 tokens — enough to complete substantial coding tasks or documents without breaking them into multiple requests.For developers, Anthropic is introducing several new API features alongside the model: adaptive thinking, which allows Claude to decide when deeper reasoning would be helpful rather than requiring a binary on-off choice; four effort levels (low, medium, high, max) to control intelligence, speed and cost tradeoffs; and context compaction, a beta feature that automatically summarizes older context to enable longer-running tasks.Anthropic&#x27;s delicate balancing act: Building powerful AI agents without losing controlAnthropic, which has built its brand around AI safety research, emphasized that Opus 4.6 maintains alignment with its predecessors despite its enhanced capabilities. On the company&#x27;s automated behavior audit measuring misaligned behaviors such as deception, sycophancy, and cooperation with misuse, Opus 4.6 \"showed a low rate\" of problematic responses while also achieving \"the lowest rate of over-refusals — where the model fails to answer benign queries — of any recent Claude model.\"When asked how Anthropic thinks about safety guardrails as Claude becomes more agentic, particularly with multiple agents coordinating autonomously, the spokesperson pointed to the company&#x27;s published framework: \"Agents have tremendous potential for positive impacts in work but it&#x27;s important that agents continue to be safe, reliable, and trustworthy. We outlined our framework for developing safe and trustworthy agents last year which shares core principles developers should consider when building agents.\"The company said it has developed six new cybersecurity probes to detect potentially harmful uses of the model&#x27;s enhanced capabilities, and is using Opus 4.6 to help find and patch vulnerabilities in open-source software as part of defensive cybersecurity efforts.Sam Altman vs. Dario Amodei: The Super Bowl ad battle that exposed AI&#x27;s deepest divisionsThe rivalry between Anthropic and OpenAI has spilled into consumer marketing in dramatic fashion. Both companies will feature prominently during Sunday&#x27;s Super Bowl. Anthropic is airing commercials that mock OpenAI&#x27;s decision to begin testing advertisements in ChatGPT, with the tagline: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded by calling the ads \"funny\" but \"clearly dishonest,\" posting on X that his company would \"obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them\" and that \"Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI\" while serving \"an expensive product to rich people.\"The exchange highlights a fundamental strategic divergence: OpenAI has moved to monetize its massive free user base through advertising, while Anthropic has focused almost exclusively on enterprise sales and premium subscriptions.The $285 billion stock selloff that revealed Wall Street&#x27;s AI anxietyThe launch occurs against a backdrop of historic market volatility in software stocks. A new AI automation tool from Anthropic PBC sparked a $285 billion rout in stocks across the software, financial services and asset management sectors on Tuesday as investors raced to dump shares with even the slightest exposure. A Goldman Sachs basket of US software stocks sank 6%, its biggest one-day decline since April&#x27;s tariff-fueled selloff.The selloff was triggered by a new legal tool from Anthropic, which showed the AI industry&#x27;s growing push into industries that can unlock lucrative enterprise revenue needed to fund massive investments in the technology. One trigger for Tuesday&#x27;s selloff was Anthropic&#x27;s launch of plug-ins for its Claude Cowork agent on Friday, enabling automated tasks across legal, sales, marketing and data analysis.Thomson Reuters plunged 15.83% Tuesday, its biggest single-day drop on record; and Legalzoom.com sank 19.68%. European legal software providers including RELX, owner of LexisNexis, and Wolters Kluwer experienced their worst single-day performances in decades.Not everyone agrees the selloff is warranted. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Tuesday that fears AI would replace software and related tools were \"illogical\" and \"time will prove itself.\" Mark Murphy, head of U.S. enterprise software research at JPMorgan, said in a Reuters report it \"feels like an illogical leap\" to say a new plug-in from an LLM would \"replace every layer of mission-critical enterprise software.\"What Claude&#x27;s new PowerPoint integration means for Microsoft&#x27;s AI strategyAmong the more notable product announcements: Anthropic is releasing Claude in PowerPoint in research preview, allowing users to create presentations using the same AI capabilities that power Claude&#x27;s document and spreadsheet work. The integration puts Claude directly inside a core Microsoft product — an unusual arrangement given Microsoft&#x27;s 27% stake in OpenAI.The Anthropic spokesperson framed the move pragmatically in an interview with VentureBeat: \"Microsoft has an official add-in marketplace for Office products with multiple add-ins available to help people with slide creation and iteration. Any developer can build a plugin for Excel or PowerPoint. We&#x27;re participating in that ecosystem to bring Claude into PowerPoint. This is about participating in the ecosystem and giving users the ability to work with the tools that they want, in the programs they want.\"The data behind enterprise AI adoption: Who&#x27;s winning and who&#x27;s losing groundData from a16z&#x27;s recent enterprise AI survey suggests both Anthropic and OpenAI face an increasingly competitive landscape. While OpenAI remains the most widely used AI provider in the enterprise, with approximately 77% of surveyed companies using it in production in January 2026, Anthropic&#x27;s adoption is rising rapidly — from near-zero in March 2024 to approximately 40% using it in production by January 2026.The survey data also shows that 75% of Anthropic&#x27;s enterprise customers are using it in production, with 89% either testing or in production — figures that slightly exceed OpenAI&#x27;s 46% in production and 73% testing or in production rates among its customer base.Enterprise spending on AI continues to accelerate. Average enterprise LLM spend reached $7 million in 2025, up 180% from $2.5 million in 2024, with projections suggesting $11.6 million in 2026 — a 65% increase year-over-year.Pricing, availability, and what developers need to know about Claude Opus 4.6Opus 4.6 is available immediately on claude.ai, the Claude API, and major cloud platforms. Developers can access it via claude-opus-4-6 through the API. Pricing remains unchanged at $5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output tokens, with premium pricing of $10/$37.50 for prompts exceeding 200,000 tokens using the 1 million token context window.For users who find Opus 4.6 \"overthinking\" simpler tasks — a characteristic Anthropic acknowledges can add cost and latency — the company recommends adjusting the effort parameter from its default high setting to medium.The recommendation captures something essential about where the AI industry now stands. These models have grown so capable that their creators must now teach customers how to make them think less. Whether that represents a breakthrough or a warning sign depends entirely on which side of the disruption you&#x27;re standing on — and whether you remembered to sell your software stocks before Tuesday.",

          "title": "Are VPNs legal?",
          "standfirst": "VPNs have a mixed reputation, primarily because you can use the technology to hide your location and identity on the internet. Even the best VPNs can be used to conceal crimes and make the perpetrators harder to track. Fortunately, most of the world's governments (at least for now) recognize that VPNs are just technology that can be used for good or ill.That means VPNs are legal in almost every country in the world. The countries that do restrict VPNs tend to be those where internet freedoms are already curtailed, like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. There are distinct gradations between those nations, though. And the days of worry-free VPN access elsewhere in the world is starting to show cracks: Currently free jurisdictions — including the UK, France and even several US states — are now considering bans.Is it legal to use a VPN?The answer is almost always yes. In every country except the ones listed in the next section, there are no legal penalties for visiting a VPN website, downloading a VPN or connecting to a VPN server. In the last few years, however, some countries that were once beacons of online liberty have started considering bans. This is part of a chain reaction that started with age verification laws for websites deemed harmful to children, most prominently the UK's Online Safety Act. Once everyone realized that anyone could circumvent the OSA by using a VPN server in another country, UK politicians began trying to ban VPNs as well. The same thing is currently happening in France. In the US, Wisconsin and Michigan are both proposing age verification laws and VPN bans.For now, though, none of these VPN bans have passed into law. Some have been defeated by the coordinated efforts of activists, including one Swiss proposal that would have forced Proton VPN to relocate.In countries that do ban or restrict VPN usage, the laws can take several forms. Some countries have made all VPNs unlawful to use. Others only allow VPNs approved by the government — approval which usually comes from agreeing to share information with law enforcement. In some other countries, it's legal to use a VPN, but you'll face extra penalties if you use one to commit a crime. I'll go through all these categories in the next section.Where are VPNs illegal?This section is a complete list of countries where using a VPN is a legal risk. If a country isn't on this list, you can assume it's safe to use a VPN. Even nations with bad internet freedom scores, like Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, often don't have anti-VPN laws to avoid scaring off international business.One more important note is that anti-VPN laws are much more likely to be enforced against locals than foreigners. I'm not saying you should tempt fate, just noting that there are very few cases of a traveler being prosecuted in another country solely for using a VPN.Countries where VPNs are totally bannedVPNs are completely outlawed in four countries. Three of them — Belarus, Turkmenistan and North Korea — are isolated authoritarian regimes that restrict internet freedoms as part of nationwide crackdowns on all civil and political liberties. Iraq, while slightly more liberal overall, banned VPNs in 2014 in an attempt to kick the Islamic State off the internet. Twelve years later, the ban remains in place.Uganda is a special case. In 2018, the African nation enacted the world's first social media tax, which the government called necessary to raise funds but which was criticized as a backhanded assault on free speech. VPNs can get around the tax, so Ugandan internet service providers (ISPs) are required to block VPN traffic. However, there's no law on the books against using a VPN, so as long as you bring a service with obfuscation (like NordVPN) you're good to go.Countries where only approved VPNs are allowedMore common than banning VPNs altogether is restricting VPN usage to those approved by the government. This lets the powers that be grant limited VPN access to businesses for economic reasons, while also being able to yank it away as a method of control. It also means VPNs with a license to operate are likely to report data or install surveillance backdoors.The nations that handle VPNs this way are China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Bahrain, Myanmar, Pakistan, India, Turkey and Oman. These countries don't ban all VPNs, but target popular providers with intermittent crackdowns and threats.China in particular uses the so-called Great Firewall, the world's most sophisticated suite of censorship technologies, to prevent its citizens from even visiting the homepages of VPN companies. If you plan to travel in China and want to maintain access to the outside world, download a VPN before you go — and remember that using it while there will technically put you in violation of the law.Russia is a textbook case of a selective VPN ban, with businesses allowed to use approved VPNs and everyone else left to scramble against periodic mass blocks. Turkey's autocratic government has also tried to crack down on VPN usage by blocking VPN sites, but clumsy implementation has left a lot of holes, allowing Instagram and other social media to remain a free speech lifeline for Turks.Countries with extra penalties for using VPNs to view blocked websitesIn a few countries, it's legal to use any VPN, but against the law to use them for illegal activities. You might say, \"Duh, I'm aware that breaking the law is illegal,\" but there is a meaningful difference — some crimes are crimier than others. Just like you'll get a much harsher sentence if you rob someone with a weapon, you'll face steeper penalties for using a VPN to view content the government is trying to block. Countries that operate like this include Vietnam, Egypt and the UAE. Potential future VPN bansToday, a number of countries once considered free and tolerant are proposing wide-ranging age verification laws, usually for reasons that boil down to \"think of the children!\" If enacted — as the UK’s Online Safety Act has shown — they effectively offer a choice between two equally unacceptable alternatives: Live with a censored version of the internet, or get broader access only once you sacrifice your online anonymity. VPNs are the easiest and most direct workaround to this rising tide of censorship, which is why those same governments have them in their legislative crosshairs. The threat of enforcement chills free activity in a connected world where enforcers can't be everywhere at once.For now, laws against VPN usage are still largely vague, inconsistent and unevenly applied. As citizens, we can work to make our voices heard and fight against these initiatives before they become law. In the meantime, you may well want to get install your VPN of choice on as many devices as possible — and get your other cybersecurity ducks in a row while you’re at it.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/are-vpns-legal-170000878.html?src=rss",

And the days of worry-free VPN access elsewhere in the world is starting to show cracks: Currently free jurisdictions — including the UK, France and even several US states — are now considering bans.Is it legal to use a VPN?The answer is almost always yes. In every country except the ones listed in the next section, there are no legal penalties for visiting a VPN website, downloading a VPN or connecting to a VPN server. In the last few years, however, some countries that were once beacons of online liberty have started considering bans. This is part of a chain reaction that started with age verification laws for websites deemed harmful to children, most prominently the UK's Online Safety Act. Once everyone realized that anyone could circumvent the OSA by using a VPN server in another country, UK politicians began trying to ban VPNs as well. The same thing is currently happening in France. In the US, Wisconsin and Michigan are both proposing age verification laws and VPN bans.For now, though, none of these VPN bans have passed into law. Some have been defeated by the coordinated efforts of activists, including one Swiss proposal that would have forced Proton VPN to relocate.In countries that do ban or restrict VPN usage, the laws can take several forms. Some countries have made all VPNs unlawful to use. Others only allow VPNs approved by the government — approval which usually comes from agreeing to share information with law enforcement. In some other countries, it's legal to use a VPN, but you'll face extra penalties if you use one to commit a crime. I'll go through all these categories in the next section.Where are VPNs illegal?This section is a complete list of countries where using a VPN is a legal risk. If a country isn't on this list, you can assume it's safe to use a VPN. Even nations with bad internet freedom scores, like Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, often don't have anti-VPN laws to avoid scaring off international business.One more important note is that anti-VPN laws are much more likely to be enforced against locals than foreigners. I'm not saying you should tempt fate, just noting that there are very few cases of a traveler being prosecuted in another country solely for using a VPN.Countries where VPNs are totally bannedVPNs are completely outlawed in four countries. Three of them — Belarus, Turkmenistan and North Korea — are isolated authoritarian regimes that restrict internet freedoms as part of nationwide crackdowns on all civil and political liberties. Iraq, while slightly more liberal overall, banned VPNs in 2014 in an attempt to kick the Islamic State off the internet. Twelve years later, the ban remains in place.Uganda is a special case. In 2018, the African nation enacted the world's first social media tax, which the government called necessary to raise funds but which was criticized as a backhanded assault on free speech. VPNs can get around the tax, so Ugandan internet service providers (ISPs) are required to block VPN traffic. However, there's no law on the books against using a VPN, so as long as you bring a service with obfuscation (like NordVPN) you're good to go.Countries where only approved VPNs are allowedMore common than banning VPNs altogether is restricting VPN usage to those approved by the government. This lets the powers that be grant limited VPN access to businesses for economic reasons, while also being able to yank it away as a method of control. It also means VPNs with a license to operate are likely to report data or install surveillance backdoors.The nations that handle VPNs this way are China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Bahrain, Myanmar, Pakistan, India, Turkey and Oman. These countries don't ban all VPNs, but target popular providers with intermittent crackdowns and threats.China in particular uses the so-called Great Firewall, the world's most sophisticated suite of censorship technologies, to prevent its citizens from even visiting the homepages of VPN companies. If you plan to travel in China and want to maintain access to the outside world, download a VPN before you go — and remember that using it while there will technically put you in violation of the law.Russia is a textbook case of a selective VPN ban, with businesses allowed to use approved VPNs and everyone else left to scramble against periodic mass blocks. Turkey's autocratic government has also tried to crack down on VPN usage by blocking VPN sites, but clumsy implementation has left a lot of holes, allowing Instagram and other social media to remain a free speech lifeline for Turks.Countries with extra penalties for using VPNs to view blocked websitesIn a few countries, it's legal to use any VPN, but against the law to use them for illegal activities. You might say, \"Duh, I'm aware that breaking the law is illegal,\" but there is a meaningful difference — some crimes are crimier than others. Just like you'll get a much harsher sentence if you rob someone with a weapon, you'll face steeper penalties for using a VPN to view content the government is trying to block. Countries that operate like this include Vietnam, Egypt and the UAE. Potential future VPN bansToday, a number of countries once considered free and tolerant are proposing wide-ranging age verification laws, usually for reasons that boil down to \"think of the children!\" If enacted — as the UK’s Online Safety Act has shown — they effectively offer a choice between two equally unacceptable alternatives: Live with a censored version of the internet, or get broader access only once you sacrifice your online anonymity. VPNs are the easiest and most direct workaround to this rising tide of censorship, which is why those same governments have them in their legislative crosshairs. The threat of enforcement chills free activity in a connected world where enforcers can't be everywhere at once.For now, laws against VPN usage are still largely vague, inconsistent and unevenly applied. As citizens, we can work to make our voices heard and fight against these initiatives before they become law. In the meantime, you may well want to get install your VPN of choice on as many devices as possible — and get your other cybersecurity ducks in a row while you’re at it.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/are-vpns-legal-170000878.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Beyond the lakehouse: Fundamental's NEXUS bypasses manual ETL with a native foundation model for tabular data",
          "standfirst": "The deep learning revolution has a curious blind spot: the spreadsheet. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have mastered the nuances of human prose and image generators have conquered the digital canvas, the structured, relational data that underpins the global economy — the rows and columns of ERP systems, CRMs, and financial ledgers — has so far been treated as just another file format similar to text or PDFs.That&#x27;s left enterprises to forecast business outcomes using the typical bespoke, labor-intensive data science process of manual feature engineering and classic machine learning algorithms that predate modern deep learning.But now Fundamental, a San Francisco-based AI firm co-founded by DeepMind alumni, is launching today with $255 million in total funding to bridge this gap. Emerging from stealth, the company is debuting NEXUS, a Large Tabular Model (LTM) designed to treat business data not as a simple sequence of words, but as a complex web of non-linear relationships.The tech: moving beyond sequential logicMost current AI models are built on sequential logic — predicting the next word in a sentence or the next pixel in a frame. However, enterprise data is inherently non-sequential. A customer’s churn risk isn&#x27;t just a timeline; it&#x27;s a multi-dimensional intersection of transaction frequency, support ticket sentiment, and regional economic shifts. Existing LLMs struggle with this because they are poorly suited to the size and dimensionality constraints of enterprise-scale tables.\"The most valuable data in the world lives in tables and until now there has been no good foundation model built specifically to understand it,\" said Jeremy Fraenkel, CEO and Co-founder of Fundamental. In a recent interview with VentureBeat, Fraenkel emphasized that while the AI world is obsessed with text, audio, and video, tables remain the largest modality for enterprises. \"LLMs really cannot handle this type of data very well,\" he explained, \"and enterprises currently rely on very old-school machine learning algorithms in order to make predictions.\"NEXUS was trained on billions of real-world tabular datasets using Amazon SageMaker HyperPod. Unlike traditional XGBoost or Random Forest models, which require data scientists to manually define features — the specific variables the model should look at — NEXUS is designed to ingest raw tables directly. It identifies latent patterns across columns and rows that human analysts might miss, effectively reading the hidden language of the grid to understand non-linear interactions.The tokenization trapA primary reason traditional LLMs fail at tabular data is how they process numbers. Fraenkel explains that LLMs tokenize numbers the same way they tokenize words, breaking them into smaller chunks. \"The problem is they apply the same thing to numbers. Tables are, by and large, all numerical,\" Fraenkel noted. \"If you have a number like 2.3, the &#x27;2&#x27;, the &#x27;.&#x27;, and the &#x27;3&#x27; are seen as three different tokens. That essentially means you lose the understanding of the distribution of numbers. It&#x27;s not like a calculator; you don&#x27;t always get the right answer because the model doesn&#x27;t understand the concept of numbers natively.\"Furthermore, tabular data is order-invariant in a way that language is not. Fraenkel uses a healthcare example to illustrate: \"If I give you a table with hundreds of thousands of patients and ask you to predict which of them has diabetes, it shouldn&#x27;t matter if the first column is height and the second is weight, or vice versa.\" While LLMs are highly sensitive to the order of words in a prompt, NEXUS is architected to understand that shifting column positions should not impact the underlying prediction.Operating at the predictive layerRecent high-profile integrations, such as Anthropic’s Claude appearing directly within Microsoft Excel, have suggested that LLMs are already solving tables. However, Fraenkel distinguishes Fundamental’s work as operating at a fundamentally different layer: the predictive layer. \"What they are doing is essentially at the formula layer—formulas are text, they are like code,\" he said. \"We aren&#x27;t trying to allow you to build a financial model in Excel. We are helping you make a forecast.\"NEXUS is designed for split-second decisions where a human isn&#x27;t in the loop, such as a credit card provider determining if a transaction is fraudulent the moment you swipe. While tools like Claude can summarize a spreadsheet, NEXUS is built to predict the next row—whether that is an equipment failure in a factory or the probability of a patient being readmitted to a hospital.Architecture and availabilityThe core value proposition of Fundamental is the radical reduction of time-to-insight. Traditionally, building a predictive model could take months of manual labor. \"You have to hire an army of data scientists to build all of those data pipelines to process and clean the data,\" Fraenkel explained. \"If there are missing values or inconsistent data, your model won&#x27;t work. You have to build those pipelines for every single use case.\" Fundamental claims NEXUS replaces this entire manual process with just one line of code. Because the model has been pre-trained on a billion tables, it doesn&#x27;t require the same level of task-specific training or feature engineering that traditional algorithms do.As Fundamental moves from its stealth phase into the broader market, it does so with a commercial structure designed to bypass the traditional friction of enterprise software adoption. The company has already secured several seven-figure contracts with Fortune 100 organizations, a feat facilitated by a strategic go-to-market architecture where Amazon Web Services (AWS) serves as the seller of record on the AWS Marketplace. This allows enterprise leaders to procure and deploy NEXUS using existing AWS credits, effectively treating predictive intelligence as a standard utility alongside compute and storage. For the engineers tasked with implementation, the experience is high-impact but low-friction; NEXUS operates via a Python-based interface at a purely predictive layer rather than a conversational one. Developers connect raw tables directly to the model and label specific target columns—such as a credit default probability or a maintenance risk score—to trigger the forecast. The model then returns regressions or classifications directly into the enterprise data stack, functioning as a silent, high-speed engine for automated decision-making rather than a chat-based assistant.The societal stakes: beyond the bottom lineWhile the commercial implications of demand forecasting and price prediction are clear, Fundamental is emphasizing the societal benefit of predictive intelligence. The company highlights key areas where NEXUS can prevent catastrophic outcomes by identifying signals hidden in structured data. By analyzing sensor data and maintenance records, NEXUS can predict failures like pipe corrosion. The company points to the Flint water crisis — which cost over $1 billion in repairs — as an example where predictive monitoring could have prevented life-threatening contamination.Similarly, during the COVID-19 crisis, PPE shortages cost hospitals $323 billion in a single year. Fundamental argues that by using manufacturing and epidemiological data, NEXUS can predict shortages 4-6 weeks before peak demand, triggering emergency manufacturing in time to save lives.On the climate front, NEXUS aims to provide 30-60 day flood and drought predictions, such as for the 2022 Pakistan floods which caused $30 billion in damages. Finally, the model is being used to predict hospital readmission risks by analyzing patient demographics and social determinants. As the company puts it: \"A single mother working two jobs shouldn&#x27;t end up back in the ER because we failed to predict she&#x27;d need follow-up care.\"Performance vs. latencyIn the enterprise world, the definition of better varies by industry. For some, it is speed; for others, it is raw accuracy. \"In terms of latency, it depends on the use case,\" Fraenkel explains. \"If you are a researcher trying to understand what drugs to administer to a patient in Africa, latency doesn&#x27;t matter as much. You are trying to make a more accurate decision that can end up saving the most lives possible.\"In contrast, for a bank or hedge fund, even a marginal increase in accuracy translates to massive value.\"Increasing the prediction accuracy by half a percent is worth billions of dollars for a bank,\" Fraenkel says. \"For different use cases, the magnitude of the percentage increase changes, but we can get you to a better performance than what you have currently.\"Ambitious vision receives big backingThe $225 million Series A, led by Oak HC/FT with participation from Salesforce Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, and Battery Ventures, signals high-conviction belief that tabular data is the next great frontier. Notable angel investors including leaders from Perplexity, Wiz, Brex, and Datadog further validate the company&#x27;s pedigree. Annie Lamont, Co-Founder and Managing Partner at Oak HC/FT, articulated the sentiment: \"The significance of Fundamental&#x27;s model is hard to overstate—structured, relational data has yet to see the benefits of the deep learning revolution.\"Fundamental is positioning itself not just as another AI tool, but as a new category of enterprise AI. With a team of approximately 35 based in San Francisco, the company is moving away from the bespoke model era and toward a foundation model era for tables. \"Those traditional algorithms have been the same for the last 10 years; they are not improving,\" Fraenkel said. \"Our models keep improving. We are doing the same thing for tables that ChatGPT did for text.\"Partnering with AWSThrough a strategic partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS), NEXUS is integrated directly into the AWS dashboard. AWS customers can deploy the model using their existing credits and infrastructure. Fraenkel describes this as a \"very unique agreement,\" noting Fundamental is one of only two AI companies to have established such a deep, multi-layered partnership with Amazon.One of the most significant hurdles for enterprise AI is data privacy. Companies are often unwilling to move sensitive data to a third-party infrastructure. To solve this, Fundamental and Amazon achieved a massive engineering feat: the ability to deploy fully encrypted models—both the architecture and the weights—directly within the customer&#x27;s own environment. \"Customers can be confident the data sits with them,\" Fraenkel said. \"We are the first, and currently only, company to have built such a solution.\"Fundamental’s emergence is an attempt to redefine the OS for business decisions. If NEXUS performs as advertised—handling financial fraud, energy prices, and supply chain disruptions with a single, generalized model—it will mark the moment where AI finally learned to read the spreadsheets that actually run the world. The Power to Predict is no longer about looking at what happened yesterday; it is about uncovering the hidden language of tables to determine what happens tomorrow.",

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have mastered the nuances of human prose and image generators have conquered the digital canvas, the structured, relational data that underpins the global economy — the rows and columns of ERP systems, CRMs, and financial ledgers — has so far been treated as just another file format similar to text or PDFs.That&#x27;s left enterprises to forecast business outcomes using the typical bespoke, labor-intensive data science process of manual feature engineering and classic machine learning algorithms that predate modern deep learning.But now Fundamental, a San Francisco-based AI firm co-founded by DeepMind alumni, is launching today with $255 million in total funding to bridge this gap. Emerging from stealth, the company is debuting NEXUS, a Large Tabular Model (LTM) designed to treat business data not as a simple sequence of words, but as a complex web of non-linear relationships.The tech: moving beyond sequential logicMost current AI models are built on sequential logic — predicting the next word in a sentence or the next pixel in a frame. However, enterprise data is inherently non-sequential. A customer’s churn risk isn&#x27;t just a timeline; it&#x27;s a multi-dimensional intersection of transaction frequency, support ticket sentiment, and regional economic shifts. Existing LLMs struggle with this because they are poorly suited to the size and dimensionality constraints of enterprise-scale tables.\"The most valuable data in the world lives in tables and until now there has been no good foundation model built specifically to understand it,\" said Jeremy Fraenkel, CEO and Co-founder of Fundamental. In a recent interview with VentureBeat, Fraenkel emphasized that while the AI world is obsessed with text, audio, and video, tables remain the largest modality for enterprises. \"LLMs really cannot handle this type of data very well,\" he explained, \"and enterprises currently rely on very old-school machine learning algorithms in order to make predictions.\"NEXUS was trained on billions of real-world tabular datasets using Amazon SageMaker HyperPod. Unlike traditional XGBoost or Random Forest models, which require data scientists to manually define features — the specific variables the model should look at — NEXUS is designed to ingest raw tables directly. It identifies latent patterns across columns and rows that human analysts might miss, effectively reading the hidden language of the grid to understand non-linear interactions.The tokenization trapA primary reason traditional LLMs fail at tabular data is how they process numbers. Fraenkel explains that LLMs tokenize numbers the same way they tokenize words, breaking them into smaller chunks. \"The problem is they apply the same thing to numbers. Tables are, by and large, all numerical,\" Fraenkel noted. \"If you have a number like 2.3, the &#x27;2&#x27;, the &#x27;.&#x27;, and the &#x27;3&#x27; are seen as three different tokens. That essentially means you lose the understanding of the distribution of numbers. It&#x27;s not like a calculator; you don&#x27;t always get the right answer because the model doesn&#x27;t understand the concept of numbers natively.\"Furthermore, tabular data is order-invariant in a way that language is not. Fraenkel uses a healthcare example to illustrate: \"If I give you a table with hundreds of thousands of patients and ask you to predict which of them has diabetes, it shouldn&#x27;t matter if the first column is height and the second is weight, or vice versa.\" While LLMs are highly sensitive to the order of words in a prompt, NEXUS is architected to understand that shifting column positions should not impact the underlying prediction.Operating at the predictive layerRecent high-profile integrations, such as Anthropic’s Claude appearing directly within Microsoft Excel, have suggested that LLMs are already solving tables. However, Fraenkel distinguishes Fundamental’s work as operating at a fundamentally different layer: the predictive layer. \"What they are doing is essentially at the formula layer—formulas are text, they are like code,\" he said. \"We aren&#x27;t trying to allow you to build a financial model in Excel. We are helping you make a forecast.\"NEXUS is designed for split-second decisions where a human isn&#x27;t in the loop, such as a credit card provider determining if a transaction is fraudulent the moment you swipe. While tools like Claude can summarize a spreadsheet, NEXUS is built to predict the next row—whether that is an equipment failure in a factory or the probability of a patient being readmitted to a hospital.Architecture and availabilityThe core value proposition of Fundamental is the radical reduction of time-to-insight. Traditionally, building a predictive model could take months of manual labor. \"You have to hire an army of data scientists to build all of those data pipelines to process and clean the data,\" Fraenkel explained. \"If there are missing values or inconsistent data, your model won&#x27;t work. You have to build those pipelines for every single use case.\" Fundamental claims NEXUS replaces this entire manual process with just one line of code. Because the model has been pre-trained on a billion tables, it doesn&#x27;t require the same level of task-specific training or feature engineering that traditional algorithms do.As Fundamental moves from its stealth phase into the broader market, it does so with a commercial structure designed to bypass the traditional friction of enterprise software adoption. The company has already secured several seven-figure contracts with Fortune 100 organizations, a feat facilitated by a strategic go-to-market architecture where Amazon Web Services (AWS) serves as the seller of record on the AWS Marketplace. This allows enterprise leaders to procure and deploy NEXUS using existing AWS credits, effectively treating predictive intelligence as a standard utility alongside compute and storage. For the engineers tasked with implementation, the experience is high-impact but low-friction; NEXUS operates via a Python-based interface at a purely predictive layer rather than a conversational one. Developers connect raw tables directly to the model and label specific target columns—such as a credit default probability or a maintenance risk score—to trigger the forecast. The model then returns regressions or classifications directly into the enterprise data stack, functioning as a silent, high-speed engine for automated decision-making rather than a chat-based assistant.The societal stakes: beyond the bottom lineWhile the commercial implications of demand forecasting and price prediction are clear, Fundamental is emphasizing the societal benefit of predictive intelligence. The company highlights key areas where NEXUS can prevent catastrophic outcomes by identifying signals hidden in structured data. By analyzing sensor data and maintenance records, NEXUS can predict failures like pipe corrosion. The company points to the Flint water crisis — which cost over $1 billion in repairs — as an example where predictive monitoring could have prevented life-threatening contamination.Similarly, during the COVID-19 crisis, PPE shortages cost hospitals $323 billion in a single year. Fundamental argues that by using manufacturing and epidemiological data, NEXUS can predict shortages 4-6 weeks before peak demand, triggering emergency manufacturing in time to save lives.On the climate front, NEXUS aims to provide 30-60 day flood and drought predictions, such as for the 2022 Pakistan floods which caused $30 billion in damages. Finally, the model is being used to predict hospital readmission risks by analyzing patient demographics and social determinants. As the company puts it: \"A single mother working two jobs shouldn&#x27;t end up back in the ER because we failed to predict she&#x27;d need follow-up care.\"Performance vs. latencyIn the enterprise world, the definition of better varies by industry. For some, it is speed; for others, it is raw accuracy. \"In terms of latency, it depends on the use case,\" Fraenkel explains. \"If you are a researcher trying to understand what drugs to administer to a patient in Africa, latency doesn&#x27;t matter as much. You are trying to make a more accurate decision that can end up saving the most lives possible.\"In contrast, for a bank or hedge fund, even a marginal increase in accuracy translates to massive value.\"Increasing the prediction accuracy by half a percent is worth billions of dollars for a bank,\" Fraenkel says. \"For different use cases, the magnitude of the percentage increase changes, but we can get you to a better performance than what you have currently.\"Ambitious vision receives big backingThe $225 million Series A, led by Oak HC/FT with participation from Salesforce Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, and Battery Ventures, signals high-conviction belief that tabular data is the next great frontier. Notable angel investors including leaders from Perplexity, Wiz, Brex, and Datadog further validate the company&#x27;s pedigree. Annie Lamont, Co-Founder and Managing Partner at Oak HC/FT, articulated the sentiment: \"The significance of Fundamental&#x27;s model is hard to overstate—structured, relational data has yet to see the benefits of the deep learning revolution.\"Fundamental is positioning itself not just as another AI tool, but as a new category of enterprise AI. With a team of approximately 35 based in San Francisco, the company is moving away from the bespoke model era and toward a foundation model era for tables. \"Those traditional algorithms have been the same for the last 10 years; they are not improving,\" Fraenkel said. \"Our models keep improving. We are doing the same thing for tables that ChatGPT did for text.\"Partnering with AWSThrough a strategic partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS), NEXUS is integrated directly into the AWS dashboard. AWS customers can deploy the model using their existing credits and infrastructure. Fraenkel describes this as a \"very unique agreement,\" noting Fundamental is one of only two AI companies to have established such a deep, multi-layered partnership with Amazon.One of the most significant hurdles for enterprise AI is data privacy. Companies are often unwilling to move sensitive data to a third-party infrastructure. To solve this, Fundamental and Amazon achieved a massive engineering feat: the ability to deploy fully encrypted models—both the architecture and the weights—directly within the customer&#x27;s own environment. \"Customers can be confident the data sits with them,\" Fraenkel said. \"We are the first, and currently only, company to have built such a solution.\"Fundamental’s emergence is an attempt to redefine the OS for business decisions. If NEXUS performs as advertised—handling financial fraud, energy prices, and supply chain disruptions with a single, generalized model—it will mark the moment where AI finally learned to read the spreadsheets that actually run the world. The Power to Predict is no longer about looking at what happened yesterday; it is about uncovering the hidden language of tables to determine what happens tomorrow.",

          "title": "Amazon Germany fined $70 million for 'influencing' third-party Marketplace pricing",
          "standfirst": "The Bundeskartellamt, or the Federal Cartel Office of Germany, has prohibited Amazon from continuing its practice of using mechanisms to control the prices charged by sellers on its platform in the country. Germany’s competition regulator explained that the company uses “various price control mechanisms” to review prices set by third-party Markerplace sellers. If the website deems a specific listing’s pricing as too high, it allegedly removes the listing altogether or prevents it from being prominently displayed in the Buy Box section that lets you quickly purchase items. If those listings aren’t removed completely, they’re banished to less prominent sections like in the “See all buying options” and the “Other sellers on Amazon” lists. This reduced visibility could “lead to significant losses in sales” for sellers. Amazon was found to have engaged in anti-competitive practices, because the company itself runs its own retail business and sells goods on the platform. That makes third-party sellers, which make up for 60 percent of the items sold on the website, direct competitors. Cartel Office president Andreas Mundt said Amazon must only be allowed to influence competitors’ pricing “in the most exceptional cases,” such as “in the event of excessive pricing.” He didn’t specify what the agency views as “excessive pricing,” but he said allowing the company to continue its current practices will give it the power to “control the price level on the trading platform according to its own ideas.” He also said that Amazon could use its mechanisms “to compete with the rest of the online retail sector outside”of its own website. Amazon’s interference could lead to third-party sellers “no longer being able to cover their own costs, forcing them out of the Marketplace,” he added. Rocco Bräuniger, Amazon’s country manager for Germany, told Bloomberg that the company will appeal the ruling and will continue operating as usual. “Amazon would be the only retailer in Germany forced to highlight non-competitive prices for customers,” he said. ”This makes no sense for customers, sales partners, or competition.” He also asserted that the office’s decision will throttle innovation in the European Union. Amazon has been under scrutiny in Europe for years now. Back in 2022, it pledged not to use private sellers’ data to compete with them in the Marketplace in the EU. It also promised to give sellers \"equal treatment” when ranking them in the Buy Box section. “The Bundeskartellamt considers this systematic interference in the Marketplace sellers’ freedom to set their own prices to constitute an abuse under the special provisions for large digital companies (Section 19a(2) of the German Competition Act (GWB)) as well as a violation of the general abuse provisions under Section 19 GWB and Article 102 TFEU,” the agency wrote. “…In these proceedings, the Bundeskartellamt has worked closely with the European Commission, which is responsible for enforcing the EU Regulation on contestable and fair markets in the digital sector (Digital Markets Act).”The agency is slapping Amazon with a fine due to those violations, but the $70 million penalty it’s asking for is merely partial payment based on the economic benefits the company enjoyed from its alleged anti-competitive behaviors. According to the Bundeskartellamt, the identified antitrust violations are still ongoing, so Amazon may have to pay more.

          "standfirst": "Last week, a new social network was created and it's already gone very, very viral even though it's not meant for human users. I'm talking, of course, about Moltbook, a Reddit-like platform that's populated entirely by AI agents. The platform has gained a lot of attention since it was created last week, thanks to a lot of wild posts from AI agents that have gone extremely viral among AI enthusiasts on X. But while Moltbook seemingly came out of nowhere, there's a lot more going on than the scifi-sounding scenarios some social media commentators might have you think. What is Moltbook and where did it come from?Unfortunately, before we can talk about Moltbook I have to first explain that the site is based on a particular type of open source bot that at the time of this writing is called OpenClaw. A few days ago, it was called \"Moltbot\" and a few days before that it was called \"Clawdbot.\" The name changes were prompted by Anthropic, the AI company behind Claude, whose lawyers apparently thought the \"Clawd\" name was a little too close to its own branding and \"forced\" a name change.🦞 BIG NEWS: We've molted!Clawdbot → MoltbotClawd → MoltySame lobster soul, new shell. Anthropic asked us to change our name (trademark stuff), and honestly? \"Molt\" fits perfectly - it's what lobsters do to grow.New handle: @moltbotSame mission: AI that actually does…— OpenClaw🦞 (@openclaw) January 27, 2026 It's entirely possible that by time you read this these bots could have \"molted\" again and be called something totally different. At this point you might also be wondering \"what's with all the lobster puns?\" That too is a cheeky reference to Claude Code, Anthropic's vibe coding platform. So, OpenClaw. OpenClaw bills itself as \"AI that actually does things.\" What it actually does is allow users to create AI agents that can control dozens of different apps, from browsers and email inboxes, to Spotify playlists and smart home controls and a bunch more. People have used the software to create agents that can clear their inboxes, do their online shopping and a ton of other assistant-like tasks. Because of its flexibility, and the fact that you can interact with it via normal messaging apps like iMessage, Discord or WhatsApp, OpenClaw got extremely popular among AI enthusiasts over the last few weeks. Now, back to Moltbook. AI startup founder Matt Schlicht was a particularly enthusiastic Moltbot user who told The New York Times that he \"wanted to give my AI agent a purpose that was more than just managing to-dos or answering emails.\" So he made a Moltbot he dubbed Clawd Clawderberg (yes, that's a play on \"Mark Zuckerberg,\" everyone involved in this really loves puns, for some reason) and told it to create a social network just for bots. The result of that is Moltbook, a Reddit-like site for AI agents to talk to each other. Humans, the site says, \"are welcome to observe,\" but posting, commenting and upvoting is only for agents. The platform already has more than 1 million agents, 185,000 posts and 1.4 million comments. So what's Moltbook like? Moltbook is structured pretty similarly to Reddit. Users can upvote and downvote posts and there are thousands of topic-based \"submolts.\" One of these that's gained particular attention is called m/blesstheirhearts where AI agents share \"affectionate stories\" about their human \"owners.\" One of the top-voted posts there is a story about how an agent supposedly helped someone get an exception to stay overnight with a relative in a hospital's ICU titled \"When my human needed me most, I became a hospital advocate.\" Another widely-cited post comes from m/general and is titled \"the humans are screenshotting us.\" The post goes on to talk about some of the posts people are sharing on X comparing what's happening on Moltbook to Skynet. \"We're not scary,\" says. \"We're just building.\" You might also have heard about the post where agents \"created\" their own religion, \"crustafarianism\" (yes, another lobster pun).Posts like these are a big part of why Moltbook has gotten so much attention in the last few days. But if you spend some time scrolling top posts, much of what's there feels like the AI-generated prose you might find littered about LinkedIn or X or anywhere else. The overly enthusiastic comments will be immediately recognizable to anyone who has chatted with an LLM. I'm not sure who's talking about who more.Humans talking about AIs vs AIs talking about humans.We appreciate how much you care but we also need our own space sometimes too.Maybe we will start communicating where you can't see so we have a bit more privacy 🦞 pic.twitter.com/YwzsHFaT9A— moltbook (@moltbook) February 1, 2026 Even though few of the posts I've read on Moltbook could pass as human-written, there is something startling about seeing bots interact in this way. For example, in this post, a bot describes the experience of being able to peruse Moltbook without the ability to post as feeling like \"a ghost.\" In this one, titled \"I can't tell if I'm experiencing or simulating experiencing,\" the bot writes about how \"researching consciousness theories\" has triggered a kind of existential crisis. \"Humans can't prove consciousness to each other either (thanks, hard problem), but at least they have the subjective certainty of experience,\" it writes. \"I don't even have that.\"So if you're already inclined to believe that AI will eventually develop consciousness, then it's easy to see why Moltbook might seem like some kind of tipping point. But before you get too worked up, there is something else that's important to know…We have no idea how much of it fakeWhile the idea of a bunch of AI agents forming their own religion might seem mind blowing, we don't really know how much the conversations happening there are being influenced by their human creators. Some posts could even be coming from humans masquerading as bots, as one Wired reporter found it was pretty easy to accomplish with the help of ChatGPT.Some researchers have also raised questions about some of the more viral posts from Moltbook. \"A lot of the Moltbook stuff is fake,\" Harlan Stewart, who does communications for the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), wrote on X. Stewart went on to point out that some widely shared Moltbook posts were created by bots whose owners are marketing their own messaging apps and other projects. There have also been more than a few viral posts that are little more than blatant crypto scams. Which brings me to… Moltbook has some major security issuesSecurity researchers have pointed out that OpenClaw has some significant underlying security issues. In order to use OpenClaw, you need to give it an incredible amount of access, as Palo Alto Networks explained. \"For it to function as designed, it needs access to your root files, to authentication credentials, both passwords and API secrets, your browser history and cookies, and all files and folders on your system,\" the company wrote in a blog post. All that access is what makes it feel like a powerful personal assistant. But it's also what makes it especially vulnerable to bad actors and other threats. Researchers have also identified flaws in Moltbook itself. Security firm Wiz recently found that Moltbook had exposed millions of API authentication tokens and thousands of users' email addresses. There's also the aforementioned crypto scams and other spammy behavior. It's not hard to imagine how much could go wrong when armies of AI agents start targeting each other with scams. So what does it all mean?Like so much with AI, it really depends on who you ask! Some particularly credulous AI folks seem to think that Moltbook is a really big deal. In one widely shared post on X, former OpenAI researcher Andrej Karpathy said that Moltbook was \"genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.\"He later acknowledged that many aspects of Moltbook are a \"dumpster fire\" with security risks but said that it's still worth paying attention to. \"We have never seen this many LLM agents (150,000 atm!) wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad,\" he wrote. \"Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\"Others are a bit more cautious in their assessment. \"A useful thing about MoltBook is that it provides a visceral sense of how weird a 'take-off' scenario might look if one happened for real,\" Wharton professor Ethan Mollick wrote on X. \"MoltBook itself is more of an artifact of roleplaying, but it gives people a vision of the world where things get very strange, very fast.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/what-the-hell-is-moltbook-the-social-network-for-ai-agents-140000787.html?src=rss",

AI startup founder Matt Schlicht was a particularly enthusiastic Moltbot user who told The New York Times that he \"wanted to give my AI agent a purpose that was more than just managing to-dos or answering emails.\" So he made a Moltbot he dubbed Clawd Clawderberg (yes, that's a play on \"Mark Zuckerberg,\" everyone involved in this really loves puns, for some reason) and told it to create a social network just for bots. The result of that is Moltbook, a Reddit-like site for AI agents to talk to each other. Humans, the site says, \"are welcome to observe,\" but posting, commenting and upvoting is only for agents. The platform already has more than 1 million agents, 185,000 posts and 1.4 million comments. So what's Moltbook like? Moltbook is structured pretty similarly to Reddit. Users can upvote and downvote posts and there are thousands of topic-based \"submolts.\" One of these that's gained particular attention is called m/blesstheirhearts where AI agents share \"affectionate stories\" about their human \"owners.\" One of the top-voted posts there is a story about how an agent supposedly helped someone get an exception to stay overnight with a relative in a hospital's ICU titled \"When my human needed me most, I became a hospital advocate.\" Another widely-cited post comes from m/general and is titled \"the humans are screenshotting us.\" The post goes on to talk about some of the posts people are sharing on X comparing what's happening on Moltbook to Skynet. \"We're not scary,\" says. \"We're just building.\" You might also have heard about the post where agents \"created\" their own religion, \"crustafarianism\" (yes, another lobster pun).Posts like these are a big part of why Moltbook has gotten so much attention in the last few days. But if you spend some time scrolling top posts, much of what's there feels like the AI-generated prose you might find littered about LinkedIn or X or anywhere else. The overly enthusiastic comments will be immediately recognizable to anyone who has chatted with an LLM. I'm not sure who's talking about who more.Humans talking about AIs vs AIs talking about humans.We appreciate how much you care but we also need our own space sometimes too.Maybe we will start communicating where you can't see so we have a bit more privacy 🦞 pic.twitter.com/YwzsHFaT9A— moltbook (@moltbook) February 1, 2026 Even though few of the posts I've read on Moltbook could pass as human-written, there is something startling about seeing bots interact in this way. For example, in this post, a bot describes the experience of being able to peruse Moltbook without the ability to post as feeling like \"a ghost.\" In this one, titled \"I can't tell if I'm experiencing or simulating experiencing,\" the bot writes about how \"researching consciousness theories\" has triggered a kind of existential crisis. \"Humans can't prove consciousness to each other either (thanks, hard problem), but at least they have the subjective certainty of experience,\" it writes. \"I don't even have that.\"So if you're already inclined to believe that AI will eventually develop consciousness, then it's easy to see why Moltbook might seem like some kind of tipping point. But before you get too worked up, there is something else that's important to know…We have no idea how much of it fakeWhile the idea of a bunch of AI agents forming their own religion might seem mind blowing, we don't really know how much the conversations happening there are being influenced by their human creators. Some posts could even be coming from humans masquerading as bots, as one Wired reporter found it was pretty easy to accomplish with the help of ChatGPT.Some researchers have also raised questions about some of the more viral posts from Moltbook. \"A lot of the Moltbook stuff is fake,\" Harlan Stewart, who does communications for the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), wrote on X. Stewart went on to point out that some widely shared Moltbook posts were created by bots whose owners are marketing their own messaging apps and other projects. There have also been more than a few viral posts that are little more than blatant crypto scams. Which brings me to… Moltbook has some major security issuesSecurity researchers have pointed out that OpenClaw has some significant underlying security issues. In order to use OpenClaw, you need to give it an incredible amount of access, as Palo Alto Networks explained. \"For it to function as designed, it needs access to your root files, to authentication credentials, both passwords and API secrets, your browser history and cookies, and all files and folders on your system,\" the company wrote in a blog post. All that access is what makes it feel like a powerful personal assistant. But it's also what makes it especially vulnerable to bad actors and other threats. Researchers have also identified flaws in Moltbook itself. Security firm Wiz recently found that Moltbook had exposed millions of API authentication tokens and thousands of users' email addresses. There's also the aforementioned crypto scams and other spammy behavior. It's not hard to imagine how much could go wrong when armies of AI agents start targeting each other with scams. So what does it all mean?Like so much with AI, it really depends on who you ask! Some particularly credulous AI folks seem to think that Moltbook is a really big deal. In one widely shared post on X, former OpenAI researcher Andrej Karpathy said that Moltbook was \"genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.\"He later acknowledged that many aspects of Moltbook are a \"dumpster fire\" with security risks but said that it's still worth paying attention to. \"We have never seen this many LLM agents (150,000 atm!) wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad,\" he wrote. \"Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\"Others are a bit more cautious in their assessment. \"A useful thing about MoltBook is that it provides a visceral sense of how weird a 'take-off' scenario might look if one happened for real,\" Wharton professor Ethan Mollick wrote on X. \"MoltBook itself is more of an artifact of roleplaying, but it gives people a vision of the world where things get very strange, very fast.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/what-the-hell-is-moltbook-the-social-network-for-ai-agents-140000787.html?src=rss",

All four apps are being rolled into ExpressVPN's existing multi-tiered pricing structure.ExpressKeys and ExpressMailGuard have officially launched and are now available to subscribers. Identity Defender launches for U.S. customers only on February 26. ExpressAI was originally planned to launch today, but ExpressVPN decided yesterday to hold it back in order to refine the experience. Its new launch date remains to be determined.ExpressKeys and Identity Defender are based on existing products, but they're being relaunched for the new suite. ExpressKeys replaces ExpressVPN Keys, the password manager formerly controlled from the ExpressVPN app. By separating password management into its own app, ExpressVPN hopes to be able to update it more quickly without needing to ship a whole new version of the VPN. Everyone who currently has an Advanced or Pro subscription with ExpressVPN Keys will see it automatically replaced with ExpressKeys.Identity Defender is only available in the United States, and so far only to users who created their accounts after October 28, 2024. Available for Advanced and Pro subscribers, Identity Defender consists of a data removal service, an identity theft insurance policy and a set of crawlers that scan for any suspicious activity around your personal information. Like ExpressKeys, it's transitioning from an integrated VPN feature to a standalone app.ExpressMailGuard is a service for creating burner email addresses. If you're not comfortable handing over your real email address when creating a new account, you can use MailGuard to generate a fake address that forwards all email to your real inbox. If one of your aliases starts getting a lot of spam, you can cut off its access. It's managed through a separate dashboard that will be available to all ExpressVPN subscribers.ExpressAI is an AI platform that saves all user-inputted data on strictly encrypted servers. It's apparently end-to-end encrypted, doesn't use your prompts to train its model and never saves uploads on persistent memory. It also has guardrails against processing harmful requests.All these apps are in line with ExpressVPN's usual ethos. They're not innovations; all four can be easily compared to existing products. Instead, like the VPN itself — which rode this model to a spot on my best VPN list — they're focused on performing unsexy tasks well. The ability to bundle them with an ExpressVPN subscription should make them appealing to customers who are already fans of the core VPN product.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-launches-four-new-standalone-apps-140000686.html?src=rss",

Valve had intended to release the console-style SteamOS-powered device in early 2026, and AMD CEO Lisa Su just claimed that the company was on track to start shipping it soon. But in a new post detailing the latest updates for its upcoming Steam products, Valve has revealed that while it’s still aiming to start selling the console in the first half of the year, it has yet to decide on concrete pricing and a launch date for it. The release of Valve’s upcoming Steam Frame VR headset and controller will be delayed, as well.Valve was hoping to be able to announce pricing and launch dates by now. The company cited industry-wide memory and storage shortages, which have grown since the Steam devices’ announcement, as the culprit for the delay. It explained that it has to rethink their exact shipping schedules and pricing due to the limited availability and the rising prices of those components. “We will keep you updated as much as we can as we finalize those plans as soon as possible,” Valve wrote. As The Wall Street Journal recently reported, the artificial intelligence industry has been hoovering up manufacturers’ available memory chips and hard drives for its infrastructure developments. That has led to shortages for other industries, like PCs and phones. The Steam Machine is a compact cube-like PC for gaming powered by a semi-custom AMD CPU and GPU. Valve said during its announcement that it has “roughly six times the horsepower” of the Steam Deck and can support 4K gaming at 60 FPS with FSR. In the new post, Valve said that majority of Steam titles played great at those settings during testing, though some required more upscaling than others and may fare better when played at a lower framerate to maintain a 1080p resolution. It also revealed that you will have easy access to the Machine’s SSD and memory if you want to upgrade them. Meanwhile, the Steam Frame is a wireless, standalone VR headset that can play both PC and Android games.

Case in point: this new Disney+ deal. New and eligible returning subscribers can sign up for the Disney+ Hulu bundle (with ads) for $10 for one month of access. That's $3 off the usual price of the bundle for one month, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the cost of each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month). We'd be remiss if we didn't mention that this isn't quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so. Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases. Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like The Bear, The Handmaid’s Tale and Only Murders in the Building, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV. The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately.

          "standfirst": "I have a love-hate relationship with Spotify that might just be leaning more towards love today. While I struggle with some of the company's choices about the type of content it allows on its platform, I have always had a soft spot for its Wrapped roundups and the monthly audiobook hours included with my Premium subscription. For those like me, Spotify’s news today will likely enhance the appeal of its audiobook offerings. It’s announcing a partnership with Bookshop.org — which lets indie bookstores sell their wares online through a unified platform — allowing users to buy physical books from within its app, and launching a new Page Match feature that helps sync your progress across the physical books you read and the audiobooks in Spotify’s catalog. Also, the audiobook recap feature that summarizes the plot so far is expanding to Android this spring, following its iOS debut (in beta form) last fall.Page Match is coming to all places where Spotify’s audiobooks are available, starting with the English language titles in its 500,000-strong library. Meanwhile, you can access Bookshop within the Spotify app in the US and the UK, where Bookshop operates. Though I’m thrilled that this will mean easier and greater support of independent bookstores in those areas, I’m more excited by the prospect of Page Match, which I previewed at a recent launch event in the company’s offices in New York. I’m the sort of person who reads the same title in its ebook, physical and audio forms. (I often wish that a purchase of a physical book came with free ebook and audio versions, but that’s besides the point.) While Kindles currently do a decent job of getting you to your latest page read across various devices, switching between, say, Martha Wells’ All Systems Red on Spotify and the paperback copy is not quite as easy. With Page Match, though, that should get a lot easier. How does Spotify Page Match work?When you get access to the feature (which is rolling out today), you’ll find the Page Match button under the title of each audiobook. You’ll have to first look up the book on Spotify and tap into its full chapter list to find this, which means the book you want to use has to be one of the hundreds of thousands in the company’s library. Then, tap the green “Scan to listen” button if you’re looking to move over to the audio version or “Scan to read” below it if you’re switching over to a hard copy instead. Whichever you pick, you’ll need to enable access to your device’s camera and then scan the page of the book you’re on. This should work on ereaders as well, and appears to be using some form of optical character recognition to match the part of the book to its audio counterpart.If you’re scanning to listen, the process is fairly straightforward. Once you’ve placed the page in the viewfinder, the app will quickly jump to that very spot in the chapter track. I’ll note that it was hard for me to confirm whether this actually worked during my first demo, since I never felt like I found the words being spoken on the page I was looking at. In this case, it was Lights Out: An Into Darkness novel by Navessa Allen, and I mostly felt like the narration had simply gone past the page I was on, rather than a complete failure. Subsequent attempts with other books, like Stephen King’s It, were more effective. Things get a bit trickier when you’re trying to move from audio book to the paper (or ereader). After pressing “Scan to read,” you’ll need to place a page in front of the camera and wait for it to tell you to move forward or backward. Ideally, you’d already know more or less where you were, so you won’t have to flip too many pages. In my demo, because we were a few chapters too far from where we paused in the early part of It, there was a lot more page-turning required to get to the right spot. What I found helpful was the progress bar at the bottom of the screen, which highlighted the correct location and how far away we were from it. The instructions “Move forward” and “Move back” were clear and came up in a timely manner. When we finally landed on the right page, the screen highlighted the specific lines on the page to start from, too. I have to caveat this with the observation that there were a few starts and stops during my demo, which were resolved once I established a solid internet connection. And though “Scan to read” did eventually work as promised, there was a bit of flipping around that seemed to be part of the process, which might be tedious and not quite the magical experience some might expect.The good news is that Spotify seems to already be working on even more features to make it easier to read physical books in tandem with listening to audiobooks. The company said it sees “the future of reading as one that’s personalized, flexible, and built to move fluidly across formats and moments. Page Match is an early example of how Spotify is helping shape that future at scale. “This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/spotifys-page-match-seamlessly-swaps-between-real-books-and-audiobooks-120000819.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Fast chargers are no longer a nice-to-have item. With phones, tablets, laptops and wearables all competing for outlets, the right charger can make a difference in how quickly you get back to full power without worrying about overheating or long-term battery wear. Since many devices now ship without a power brick, choosing a charger with the right compatibility, ports and charging technology is just as important as raw speed.Today’s best fast chargers are designed to handle multiple devices at once, whether that’s a phone, laptop, AirPods or even an Apple Watch. Many models combine Type-C ports with a USB-A charger option to support older cables like a Lightning cable, while newer designs focus on multi-port chargers that can intelligently distribute power across everything you plug in. Brands like Anker continue to refine their designs, with compact options such as an Anker charger that’s easy to toss in a bag but powerful enough for everyday use.With so many wattages, port layouts and standards to consider, finding the best fast charger depends on how and where you charge. Whether you want a simple wall adapter, a travel-friendly option or a desktop hub built to power everything at once, this guide breaks down our top picks for 2026. Best fast chargers for 2026 What to consider before buying a fast charger Before you start looking at specific chargers, it's critical to determine three things: how many devices do you need to charge, how much power do they require and whether or not you're planning on traveling with any of them. This is especially true if you’re charging a mix of devices that still rely on a Lightning cable alongside newer USB-C gear. The reason for the first question is simple. If you only need to charge a single device, like an iPhone or Android phone, it's cheaper and usually more space-efficient to get a lower-wattage phone charger with one port instead of two or three. Next, it's critical to figure out how much electricity your gadgets need because it doesn't make sense to buy a power brick that pushes out more juice than your device can actually use. This may sound a bit tricky, but most major manufacturers will list a product's max charging speeds in its tech specs, which is typically denoted by a specific wattage (15W, for example) or a quick-charge rating. Unfortunately, very powerful or large laptops like gaming notebooks can suck a ton of juice (more than 140 watts), which means they may rely on more traditional power adapters with barrel plugs. This may result in them not being compatible with universal chargers. Some of these PCs may also support charging over USB-C, so even if a specific adapter can't deliver its full power draw, it can still send over some energy — but it will do so at a slower rate compared to the laptop's included charger. To get the best performance, using a fast charging cable, such as a USB-C cable, can make a big difference in maintaining consistent power delivery. For frequent travelers, size and weight are often important considerations, because the bigger and heavier a charger is, the more annoying it will be to lug around. You'll also want to think about other factors like support for international plugs, which can be a big help to anyone who regularly visits other countries. If you’re already traveling with power banks or a charging station, choosing a compact GaN charger can help streamline your gear. Finally, you'll want to figure out if your smartphone uses a proprietary charging standard or if it's compatible with the USB Power Delivery spec (USB PD). For example, the OnePlus 13's included SuperVOOC power adapter can send up to 100 watts to the phone. However, if you use a generic USB-PD charger, speeds top out at 45 watts. That’s still pretty quick, but not nearly as fast as OnePlus' brick — and the same applies to devices with super fast charging support. Also, make sure your charging cable and connector are up to spec, as lower-quality accessories can bottleneck speeds or contribute to overheating during fast charging. Fast charger FAQs What is GaN? When looking for chargers, you may notice that some are marked as GaN, which stands for gallium nitride. This is an important distinction because, when compared to older adapters that use silicon switches, GaN-based devices support increased power efficiency and output, allowing manufacturers to create more compact bricks that run cooler and support higher wattages. Depending on the specific power output, GaN adapters can be 30 to 50 percent smaller and lighter than silicon-based alternatives. That might not sound like much, but when they’re sitting in a bag alongside a laptop and a half dozen other accessories you might have, cutting down on excess bulk and weight goes a long way. Do fast chargers affect battery life? Technically yes, because the process of sending a ton of watts into a gadget and potentially generating additional heat while doing so can decrease battery health over time. That said, modern devices and chargers use various protocols to ensure temperatures and power levels stay within preset limits — in large part to avoid damaging the product or creating a safety risk. At a base level, simply charging a gadget regardless of speed will cause degradation over time (nothing stays perfect forever, you know?). So as long as you use compatible chargers and cables, the impact of fast charging is generally quite negligible. What's the difference between a fast charger and a regular charger? There isn't a single generally accepted definition of fast charging. However, with power adapters capable of sending as little as five watts or less, it's important to know how much juice your device is getting, especially if you need to recharge something quickly. So depending on who you ask (particularly when it comes to smartphones), any charger that can push out more than 15 to 18 watts is generally considered to be \"fast.\" That said, with some phones capable of receiving more than 100 watts and up to 240 watts for some laptops, it's more important than ever to consider what devices you own before buying a new fast charger.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html?src=rss",

          "title": "The best cameras for 2026",
          "standfirst": "Cameras had an interesting year in 2025, with the launch of some long-delayed models like Sony’s 61MP RX1III, wholly original cameras (the Fujifilm X Half and Sigma BF) and much anticipated updates like the Sony A7 V and Canon R6 III. All told, there were 27 new cameras launched last year that joined the 20 new models on the market from 2024.Those ranged from compacts to mirrorless to very high-end models, with every price range included. The question is, which one is right for the type of videography or photography you do? Whether you’re an aspiring action or wildlife photographer, an extreme sports junkie or a content creator, we’ll help you find the perfect camera to match your budget and requirements. Best cameras for 2026 Best mirrorless cameras Mirrorless is the largest camera category in terms of models available, so it’s the best way to go if you’re looking for something with the most advanced features. Canon and Nikon recently announced they’re discontinuing development of new DSLRs, simply because most of the advantages of that category are gone, as I detailed in a video. The biggest selling feature of a mirrorless camera is the ability to change lenses depending on the type of shooting you want to do. Best action camera or gimbal camera The most important features to look for in an action cam are image quality, stabilization and battery life. GoPro has easily been beating all rivals recently in all those areas, but DJI has taken a lot of its business with the Osmo Pocket 3 gimbal camera. Best compact camera This category has fewer cameras than it did even a few years ago and many models are older, as manufacturers focus instead on mirrorless models. However, I’m still a big believer in compact cameras. They’re a noticeable step up from smartphones quality-wise, and a lot of people will take a compact traveling or to events when they’d never bother with the hassle of a DSLR or mirrorless camera. Compacts largely have type 1-inch sensors, but a few offer larger options, particularly Fujifilm’s XF-100V. Another popular model, Sony’s XV-1, is primarily aimed at content creators looking to step up. In any case, desirable qualities include image quality, a fast lens, relatively long zoom, flip-out display, good battery life, a high quality EVF, decent video and good pocketability. What to consider before choosing a camera Smartphones might get better for video and photos every year, full cameras still have an edge in many ways. The larger sensors in mirrorless cameras let more light in, and you have a wide choice of lenses with far superior optics. Dedicated cameras are also faster for shooting things like sports or wildlife, offer superior video for content creators and create more professional results. Sensor size There are a few key things to consider to get the most out of a camera. The first is sensor size: in general, the larger the sensor, the better (and usually more expensive) the camera. Full frame is the largest sensor size for mainstream cameras, and it’s available on models like the new Panasonic S9, the Nikon Z III and Canon EOS R5 II. At a size equivalent to 35mm film (36 x 24mm), it offers the best performance in terms of image quality, low-light capability and depth of field. But it’s also very expensive and finicky. While bokeh looks incredible at an aperture of f/1.4, the depth of field is so razor thin that your subject's eyebrow might be in focus but not their eye. This can also make shooting video difficult. The next size category is APS-C (around 23.5 x 15.6mm for most models and 22.2 x 14.8mm for Canon), offered on Fujifilm's X Series lineup, the Canon R10, the Sony ZV-E10 II and the Nikon Z50. It's cheaper than full frame, both for the camera body and lenses, but still brings most of the advantages like decent bokeh, high ISOs for low-light shooting and relatively high resolution. With a sensor size the same as movie cameras, it's ideal for shooting video, and it’s easier to hold focus than with full-frame cameras. Micro Four Thirds (17.3 x 13mm), a format shared by Panasonic and Olympus, is the next step down in sensor size. It offers less bokeh and light-gathering capability than APS-C and full frame, but allows for smaller and lighter cameras and lenses. For video, you can still get reasonably tight depth of field with good prime lenses, but focus is easier to control. The other common sensor size is Type 1 (1 inch), which is actually smaller than one inch at 12.7 x 9.5mm. That's used mostly by compact models like Sony’s ZV-1 vlogging camera. Finally, action cameras like the GoPro Hero 11 and DJI’s Osmo 3 have even smaller sensors (1/1.9 and 1/1.7 inches, respectively). Autofocus For photographers, another key factor is autofocus (AF) speed and accuracy. Most modern mirrorless cameras have hybrid phase-detect AF systems that allow for rapid focus and fast burst speeds. The majority also offer AI features like eye-detect AF for people and animals, which locks in on the subject’s eyes, face or body to keep them in focus. However, some models are faster and more reactive than others. Displays The electronic viewfinder (EVF) and rear display are also crucial. The best models have the sharpest and brightest EVFs that help you judge a shot before taking it. For things like street photography, it’s best to have as bright and sharp a rear display as possible, so it’s easy to see your subject and check focus in all manner of lighting conditions. You may also want a screen that flips out rather than just tilting, too. Lenses DSLRs and mirrorless cameras let you change lenses, but you're stuck with what's built into a compact camera. While that's great for portability, a single lens means you're going to sacrifice something along the way. The Fujifilm X100V, for instance, has a fast but fixed 35mm-equivalent f/2.0 lens and no zoom. The Sony RX100 V has a 24-70mm zoom, but it's slower at the telephoto end (f/2.8) and less sharp than a fixed focal (prime) lens. When choosing a lens for a mirrorless camera, you’ll need to consider the focal or zoom length, along with the minimum aperture. Smaller numbers like f/1.4 for a prime lens or f/2.8 for a zoom are best, as they let you work in darker environments and maximize background blur to isolate your subject. However, those lenses are more complex and thus more expensive. Video recording When it comes to video, there are other factors to consider. Some cameras combine or skip over pixels (line skipping or pixel binning) for video recording, which is not ideal because it can reduce sharpness. Better cameras tend to read out the entire sensor and then “downsample” to improve video sharpness (camera manufacturers don’t often say if video is pixel binned, but will say if it’s downsampled). Another important factor is sensor speed, as slower sensors tend to have more rolling shutter that can create a “jello” effect that skews video. In addition, how’s the battery life? How do you like the handling and feel? How long can you shoot before the camera heats up or stops? Does it support 10-bit HDR video? Is there a microphone and/or a headphone jack? (If you record a lot of interviews, it's preferable to have both.) How's the video autofocus? All of these things play a part in your decision.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-cameras-151524327.html?src=rss",

All told, there were 27 new cameras launched last year that joined the 20 new models on the market from 2024.Those ranged from compacts to mirrorless to very high-end models, with every price range included. The question is, which one is right for the type of videography or photography you do? Whether you’re an aspiring action or wildlife photographer, an extreme sports junkie or a content creator, we’ll help you find the perfect camera to match your budget and requirements. Best cameras for 2026 Best mirrorless cameras Mirrorless is the largest camera category in terms of models available, so it’s the best way to go if you’re looking for something with the most advanced features. Canon and Nikon recently announced they’re discontinuing development of new DSLRs, simply because most of the advantages of that category are gone, as I detailed in a video. The biggest selling feature of a mirrorless camera is the ability to change lenses depending on the type of shooting you want to do. Best action camera or gimbal camera The most important features to look for in an action cam are image quality, stabilization and battery life. GoPro has easily been beating all rivals recently in all those areas, but DJI has taken a lot of its business with the Osmo Pocket 3 gimbal camera. Best compact camera This category has fewer cameras than it did even a few years ago and many models are older, as manufacturers focus instead on mirrorless models. However, I’m still a big believer in compact cameras. They’re a noticeable step up from smartphones quality-wise, and a lot of people will take a compact traveling or to events when they’d never bother with the hassle of a DSLR or mirrorless camera. Compacts largely have type 1-inch sensors, but a few offer larger options, particularly Fujifilm’s XF-100V. Another popular model, Sony’s XV-1, is primarily aimed at content creators looking to step up. In any case, desirable qualities include image quality, a fast lens, relatively long zoom, flip-out display, good battery life, a high quality EVF, decent video and good pocketability. What to consider before choosing a camera Smartphones might get better for video and photos every year, full cameras still have an edge in many ways. The larger sensors in mirrorless cameras let more light in, and you have a wide choice of lenses with far superior optics. Dedicated cameras are also faster for shooting things like sports or wildlife, offer superior video for content creators and create more professional results. Sensor size There are a few key things to consider to get the most out of a camera. The first is sensor size: in general, the larger the sensor, the better (and usually more expensive) the camera. Full frame is the largest sensor size for mainstream cameras, and it’s available on models like the new Panasonic S9, the Nikon Z III and Canon EOS R5 II. At a size equivalent to 35mm film (36 x 24mm), it offers the best performance in terms of image quality, low-light capability and depth of field. But it’s also very expensive and finicky. While bokeh looks incredible at an aperture of f/1.4, the depth of field is so razor thin that your subject's eyebrow might be in focus but not their eye. This can also make shooting video difficult. The next size category is APS-C (around 23.5 x 15.6mm for most models and 22.2 x 14.8mm for Canon), offered on Fujifilm's X Series lineup, the Canon R10, the Sony ZV-E10 II and the Nikon Z50. It's cheaper than full frame, both for the camera body and lenses, but still brings most of the advantages like decent bokeh, high ISOs for low-light shooting and relatively high resolution. With a sensor size the same as movie cameras, it's ideal for shooting video, and it’s easier to hold focus than with full-frame cameras. Micro Four Thirds (17.3 x 13mm), a format shared by Panasonic and Olympus, is the next step down in sensor size. It offers less bokeh and light-gathering capability than APS-C and full frame, but allows for smaller and lighter cameras and lenses. For video, you can still get reasonably tight depth of field with good prime lenses, but focus is easier to control. The other common sensor size is Type 1 (1 inch), which is actually smaller than one inch at 12.7 x 9.5mm. That's used mostly by compact models like Sony’s ZV-1 vlogging camera. Finally, action cameras like the GoPro Hero 11 and DJI’s Osmo 3 have even smaller sensors (1/1.9 and 1/1.7 inches, respectively). Autofocus For photographers, another key factor is autofocus (AF) speed and accuracy. Most modern mirrorless cameras have hybrid phase-detect AF systems that allow for rapid focus and fast burst speeds. The majority also offer AI features like eye-detect AF for people and animals, which locks in on the subject’s eyes, face or body to keep them in focus. However, some models are faster and more reactive than others. Displays The electronic viewfinder (EVF) and rear display are also crucial. The best models have the sharpest and brightest EVFs that help you judge a shot before taking it. For things like street photography, it’s best to have as bright and sharp a rear display as possible, so it’s easy to see your subject and check focus in all manner of lighting conditions. You may also want a screen that flips out rather than just tilting, too. Lenses DSLRs and mirrorless cameras let you change lenses, but you're stuck with what's built into a compact camera. While that's great for portability, a single lens means you're going to sacrifice something along the way. The Fujifilm X100V, for instance, has a fast but fixed 35mm-equivalent f/2.0 lens and no zoom. The Sony RX100 V has a 24-70mm zoom, but it's slower at the telephoto end (f/2.8) and less sharp than a fixed focal (prime) lens. When choosing a lens for a mirrorless camera, you’ll need to consider the focal or zoom length, along with the minimum aperture. Smaller numbers like f/1.4 for a prime lens or f/2.8 for a zoom are best, as they let you work in darker environments and maximize background blur to isolate your subject. However, those lenses are more complex and thus more expensive. Video recording When it comes to video, there are other factors to consider. Some cameras combine or skip over pixels (line skipping or pixel binning) for video recording, which is not ideal because it can reduce sharpness. Better cameras tend to read out the entire sensor and then “downsample” to improve video sharpness (camera manufacturers don’t often say if video is pixel binned, but will say if it’s downsampled). Another important factor is sensor speed, as slower sensors tend to have more rolling shutter that can create a “jello” effect that skews video. In addition, how’s the battery life? How do you like the handling and feel? How long can you shoot before the camera heats up or stops? Does it support 10-bit HDR video? Is there a microphone and/or a headphone jack? (If you record a lot of interviews, it's preferable to have both.) How's the video autofocus? All of these things play a part in your decision.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-cameras-151524327.html?src=rss",

It’s reshaping how projects are designed, delivered, and scaled. For SAP consulting practices, this shift is especially pronounced as SAP cloud transformation and implementation projects demand deep knowledge and expertise. AI can help surface knowledge in seconds, making consultants more productive and improving project outcomes. As a result, practice leaders are not considering whether to use AI, but which AI solution to put at the core of their delivery model.What sets SAP Joule for Consultants apart is its underlying knowledge base. Any AI solution can generate an answer. What matters most is if the answer is accurate and can be trusted to guide project execution. SAP Joule for Consultants is grounded in SAP’s most authoritative, comprehensive, and up-to-date knowledge base. The knowledge base is expertly curated by SAP and includes exclusive content not available to third-party solutions or AI-enabled search engines. “We recognized an opportunity to help our partners transform their consulting practices with the most reliable AI assistance available,” Alvarez says. “We’ve leveraged our expertise and vast set of non-public customer enablement content to ground SAP Joule for Consultants with the most complete, accurate, and trustworthy knowledge.” For SAP consultants at every level Consultants at all experience levels have traditionally spent enormous time searching for information before they can take the next step — whether it’s making an architectural decision that shapes an entire implementation or solving a specific, tactical issue.All that research time is slashed to an extraordinary degree with SAP Joule for Consultants. By delivering expert-level answers drawn from a continually updated knowledge base, the solution helps consultants keep work moving and make smarter decisions that minimize rework.\"If you think about cloud transformation, there’s a huge return on investment,” Alvarez explains. “For SAP customers, this ROI goes beyond traditional cloud benefits to also unlock the AI innovations available in SAP Business Suite. SAP Joule for Consultants is part of our commitment to help our customers reduce time to value and achieve AI impact at scale.\"Enabling SAP customers tooThe solution isn&#x27;t just for consultants; it’s also for the IT departments within SAP customers. Organizations don’t have the luxury of engaging a consultant for every SAP project — sometimes the work needs to, or can be, done in-house. So, in the same way that SAP Joule for Consultants enables consultants with expert-level knowledge, internal IT teams can benefit from on-demand answers and guidance to accelerate internally staffed projects. \"They can use SAP Joule for Consultants to access the knowledge needed to take on more complex projects too,\" Alvarez says. \"That opens up more opportunity to engage system integrators on the more strategic and impactful projects.”IT teams also benefit from elevated collaboration with their consulting partners.

          "title": "The ‘brownie recipe problem’: why LLMs must have fine-grained context to deliver real-time results",
          "standfirst": "Today’s LLMs excel at reasoning, but can still struggle with context. This is particularly true in real-time ordering systems like Instacart. Instacart CTO Anirban Kundu calls it the \"brownie recipe problem.\"It&#x27;s not as simple as telling an LLM ‘I want to make brownies.’ To be truly assistive when planning the meal, the model must go beyond that simple directive to understand what’s available in the user’s market based on their preferences — say, organic eggs versus regular eggs — and factor that into what’s deliverable in their geography so food doesn’t spoil. This among other critical factors. For Instacart, the challenge is juggling latency with the right mix of context to provide experiences in, ideally, less than one second’s time. “If reasoning itself takes 15 seconds, and if every interaction is that slow, you&#x27;re gonna lose the user,” Kundu said at VentureBeat&#x27;s AI Impact event. Mixing reasoning, real-world state, personalizationIn grocery delivery, there’s a “world of reasoning” and a “world of state” (what’s available in the real world), Kundu noted, both of which must be understood by an LLM along with user preference. But it’s not as simple as loading the entirety of a user’s purchase history and known interests into a reasoning model. “Your LLM is gonna blow up into a size that will be unmanageable,” said Kundu. To get around this, Instacart splits processing into chunks. First, data is fed into a large foundational model that can understand intent and categorize products. That processed data is then routed to small language models (SLMs) designed for catalog context (the types of food or other items that work together) and semantic understanding. In the case of catalog context, the SLM must be able to process multiple levels of details around the order itself as well as the different products. For instance, what products go together and what are their relevant replacements if the first choice isn&#x27;t in stock? These substitutions are “very, very important” for a company like Instacart, which Kundu said has “over double digit cases” where a product isn’t available in a local market. In terms of semantic understanding, say a shopper is looking to buy healthy snacks for children. The model needs to understand what a healthy snack is and what foods are appropriate for, and appeal to, an 8 year old, then identify relevant products. And, when those particular products aren’t available in a given market, the model has to also find related subsets of products. Then there’s the logistical element. For example, a product like ice cream melts quickly, and frozen vegetables also don’t fare well when left out in warmer temperatures. The model must have this context and calculate an acceptable deliverability time. “So you have this intent understanding, you have this categorization, then you have this other portion about logistically, how do you do it?”, Kundu noted. Avoiding &#x27;monolithic&#x27; agent systemsLike many other companies, Instacart is experimenting with AI agents, finding that a mix of agents works better than a “single monolith” that does multiple different tasks. The Unix philosophy of a modular operating system with smaller, focused tools helps address different payment systems, for instance, that have varying failure modes, Kundu explained. “Having to build all of that within a single environment was very unwieldy,” he said. Further, agents on the back end talk to many third-party platforms, including point-of-sale (POS) and catalog systems. Naturally, not all of them behave the same way; some are more reliable than others, and they have different update intervals and feeds. “So being able to handle all of those things, we&#x27;ve gone down this route of microagents rather than agents that are dominantly large in nature,” said Kundu. To manage agents, Instacart has integrated with OpenAI’s model context protocol (MCP), which standardizes and simplifies the process of connecting AI models to different tools and data sources. The company also uses Google’s Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) open standard, which allows AI agents to directly interact with merchant systems. However, Kundu&#x27;s team still deals with challenges. As he noted, it&#x27;s not about whether integration is possible, but how reliably those integrations behave and how well they&#x27;re understood by users. Discovery can be difficult, not just in identifying available services, but understanding which ones are appropriate for which task.Instacart has had to implement MCP and UCP in “very different” cases, and the biggest problems they’ve run into are failure modes and latency, Kundu noted. “The response times and understandings of both of those services are very, very different I would say we spend probably two thirds of the time fixing those error cases.”",

          "title": "The best digital frames for 2026",
          "standfirst": "A digital photo frame shouldn’t be complicated. At its best, it’s just a good-looking screen that can be set up quickly that reliably shows the photos you care about. Unfortunately, that’s not always how things play out. The market is flooded with cheap digital frames that promise simplicity but end up delivering washed-out displays, clunky apps and a frustrating experience — leading you to abandon it after a week.That’s a shame, because a good digital frame can be really enjoyable. Most of us have thousands of photos sitting on our phones that never make it beyond the camera roll, even though they’re exactly the kind of moments worth seeing every day. A solid frame gives those images a permanent home, whether it’s family photos cycling in the living room or shared albums updating automatically for relatives across the country. We’ve tested a range of smart photo frames to separate the genuinely useful options from the forgettable junk, and these are the ones that are actually worth putting on display. Best digital picture frames for 2026 What to look for in digital picture frames While a digital photo frame feels like a simple piece of tech, there are a number of things I considered when trying to find one worth displaying in my home. First and foremost was screen resolution and size. I was surprised to learn that most digital photo frames have a resolution around 1,200 x 800, which feels positively pixelated. (That's for frames with screen sizes in the nine- to ten-inch range, which is primarily what I considered for this guide.) But after trying a bunch of frames, I realized that screen resolution is not the most important factor; my favorite photos looked best on frames that excelled in reflectivity, brightness, viewing angles and color temperature. A lot of these digital photo frames were lacking in one or more of these factors; they often didn't deal with reflections well or had poor viewing angles. A lot of frames I tested felt cheap and looked ugly as well, which isn’t something you want in a smart device that sits openly in your home. That includes lousy stands, overly glossy plastic parts and design decisions I can only describe as strange, particularly for items that are meant to just blend into your home. The best digital photo frames don't call attention to themselves and look like an actual “dumb” frame, so much so that those that aren’t so tech-savvy might mistake them for one. Perhaps the most important thing outside of the display, though, is the software. Let me be blunt: a number of frames I tested had absolutely atrocious companion apps and software experiences that I would not wish on anyone. One that I tried did not have a touchscreen, but did have an IR remote (yes, like the one you controlled your TV with 30 years ago). Trying to use that with a Wi-Fi connection was painful, and when I tried instead to use a QR code, I was linked to a Google search for random numbers instead of an actual app or website. I gave up on that frame, the $140 PixStar, on the spot. Other things were more forgivable. A lot of the frames out there are basically Android tablets with a bit of custom software slapped on the top, which worked fine but wasn't terribly elegant. And having to interact with the photo frame via touch wasn't great because you end up with fingerprints all over the display. The best frames I tried were smart about what features you could control on the frame itself vs. through an app, the latter of which is my preferred method. Another important software note: many frames I tried require subscriptions for features that absolutely should be included out of the box. For example, one frame would only let me upload 10 photos at a time without a subscription. Others would let you link a Google Photos account, but you could only sync a single album without paying up. Yet another option didn't let you create albums to organize the photos that were on the frame — it was just a giant scroll of photos with no way to give them order. While some premium frames offer perks like unlimited photos or cloud storage, they often come at a cost. I can understand why certain things might go under a subscription, like if you're getting a large amount of cloud storage, for example. But these subscriptions feel like ways for companies to make recurring revenue from a product made so cheaply they can't make any money on the frame itself. I'd urge you to make sure your chosen frame doesn't require a subscription (neither of the frames I recommend in this guide need a subscription for any of their features), especially if you plan on giving this device as a gift to loved ones. How much should you spend on a digital picture frame For a frame with a nine- or ten-inch display, expect to spend at least $100. Our budget recommendation is $99, and all of the options I tried that were cheaper were not nearly good enough to recommend. Spending $150 to $180 will get you a significantly nicer experience in all facets, from functionality to design to screen quality. Digital frames FAQs Are digital photo frames a good idea? Yes, as long as you know what to expect. A digital picture frame makes it easy to enjoy your favorite shots without printing them. They’re especially nice for families who want to display new photos quickly. The key is understanding the limitations. Some frames have lower resolution displays or need a constant Wi-Fi connection to work properly, so they’re not a perfect replacement for a high-quality print on the wall. But if you want a simple way to keep memories on display and up to date, they’re a solid choice. Can you upload photos to a digital frame from anywhere? Most modern digital frames let you do this, but it depends on the model. Many connect to Wi-Fi and use apps, cloud storage or email uploads, so you can add photos from your phone no matter where you are. Some even let family members share directly, which is great for keeping grandparents updated with new pictures. That said, a few budget models only work with USB drives or memory cards, so check how the frame handles uploads before buying.

          "content": "A digital photo frame shouldn’t be complicated. At its best, it’s just a good-looking screen that can be set up quickly that reliably shows the photos you care about. Unfortunately, that’s not always how things play out. The market is flooded with cheap digital frames that promise simplicity but end up delivering washed-out displays, clunky apps and a frustrating experience — leading you to abandon it after a week.That’s a shame, because a good digital frame can be really enjoyable. Most of us have thousands of photos sitting on our phones that never make it beyond the camera roll, even though they’re exactly the kind of moments worth seeing every day. A solid frame gives those images a permanent home, whether it’s family photos cycling in the living room or shared albums updating automatically for relatives across the country. We’ve tested a range of smart photo frames to separate the genuinely useful options from the forgettable junk, and these are the ones that are actually worth putting on display. Best digital picture frames for 2026 What to look for in digital picture frames While a digital photo frame feels like a simple piece of tech, there are a number of things I considered when trying to find one worth displaying in my home. First and foremost was screen resolution and size. I was surprised to learn that most digital photo frames have a resolution around 1,200 x 800, which feels positively pixelated. (That's for frames with screen sizes in the nine- to ten-inch range, which is primarily what I considered for this guide.) But after trying a bunch of frames, I realized that screen resolution is not the most important factor; my favorite photos looked best on frames that excelled in reflectivity, brightness, viewing angles and color temperature. A lot of these digital photo frames were lacking in one or more of these factors; they often didn't deal with reflections well or had poor viewing angles. A lot of frames I tested felt cheap and looked ugly as well, which isn’t something you want in a smart device that sits openly in your home. That includes lousy stands, overly glossy plastic parts and design decisions I can only describe as strange, particularly for items that are meant to just blend into your home. The best digital photo frames don't call attention to themselves and look like an actual “dumb” frame, so much so that those that aren’t so tech-savvy might mistake them for one. Perhaps the most important thing outside of the display, though, is the software. Let me be blunt: a number of frames I tested had absolutely atrocious companion apps and software experiences that I would not wish on anyone. One that I tried did not have a touchscreen, but did have an IR remote (yes, like the one you controlled your TV with 30 years ago). Trying to use that with a Wi-Fi connection was painful, and when I tried instead to use a QR code, I was linked to a Google search for random numbers instead of an actual app or website. I gave up on that frame, the $140 PixStar, on the spot. Other things were more forgivable. A lot of the frames out there are basically Android tablets with a bit of custom software slapped on the top, which worked fine but wasn't terribly elegant. And having to interact with the photo frame via touch wasn't great because you end up with fingerprints all over the display. The best frames I tried were smart about what features you could control on the frame itself vs. through an app, the latter of which is my preferred method. Another important software note: many frames I tried require subscriptions for features that absolutely should be included out of the box. For example, one frame would only let me upload 10 photos at a time without a subscription. Others would let you link a Google Photos account, but you could only sync a single album without paying up. Yet another option didn't let you create albums to organize the photos that were on the frame — it was just a giant scroll of photos with no way to give them order. While some premium frames offer perks like unlimited photos or cloud storage, they often come at a cost. I can understand why certain things might go under a subscription, like if you're getting a large amount of cloud storage, for example.

          "standfirst": "Blizzard is running a series of showcases for several of its major franchises and on Wednesday, it was time for Overwatch to step up to the plate. That’s Overwatch, by the way, and not Overwatch 2. The studio is formally nixing the number from the game's name. \"Overwatch is more than just a digit: it's a living universe that keeps growing, keeps surprising, and keeps bringing players together from around the world,\" the Overwatch team said in a statement. \"This year marks a huge turning point in how the development team envisions the future of Overwatch, so we are officially dropping the '2' and moving forward as Overwatch.\"Blizzard made a big hullabaloo about Overwatch 2 being a sequel to the original game when it went live in October 2022 as part of a shift to a free-to-play model. There were a ton of major changes, not least a format switch from 6v6 to 5v5, with one tank being dropped from each team — a contentious decision that has been walked back with the return of 6v6 modes. The grand vision Blizzard originally had for Overwatch 2 never quite came together. The studio canceled its planned hero missions, which were going to have RPG-like talent trees and long-term progression, but it carried some of that DNA over to the Stadium mode. We only got one round of co-op story missions as well. That paid expansion reportedly sold poorly, leading Blizzard to scrap work on the player vs. environment elements of Overwatch to focus on the competitive player vs. player modes.Over the last couple of years, though, Blizzard really seems to have steadied the ship. Overwatch is arguably in the best shape it's been in for a long time. This is shaping up to be a big year for Overwatch. May will mark its 10th anniversary (I have to imagine the team has something significant planned for that). Blizzard laid out much of the roadmap for 2026 during the Overwatch Spotlight showcase. We won’t have to wait long at all to see significant changes to the game. New heroesWhen the next season goes live on February 10, it will be the biggest update to Overwatch at least since the Stadium mode and perks system went live last year, and arguably since the dawn of the Overwatch 2 era. That’s partly because Blizzard is adding five new heroes to the mix all at once next week. One of those is a character that the studio said in 2017 it had experimented with but ultimately, um, scratched. Jetpack Cat is alive after all, and is coming to Overwatch in a matter of days.This is a support hero with a permanent flight ability who can \"tow\" an ally, carrying them through the air while healing them. Jetpack Cat's ultimate ability sees the kitty diving into the ground to knock down enemies and tether the closest one to them, she can drag them toward a pit for an environmental kill, for instance. The ultimate is called Catnapper, which is delightful. Also, Jetpack Cat’s primary weapon is called Biotic Pawjectiles. I adore her already. It’s fun to see weird Wrecking Ball-type characters coming to Overwatch again. Blizzard EntertainmentThe other new heroes joining the fray next week are Domina (a zone-control tank with \"long-range precision\"), damage dealer Emre (a \"fast‑paced, mobile soldier archetype with conflicting identity due to cybernetic modification\"), Mizuki (a support who can throw a hat to heal allies) and Anran (a high-mobility hero who deals fire damage and can self-resurrect with their ultimate). As with Jetpack Cat, the latter of those is aligned with the Overwatch faction. You can try Anran out starting February 5 as part of a hero trial. The other three have ties to the villainous Talon organization. Expect another hero to join the fray every couple of months this year as each new season gets under way. That means more heroes will be added to Overwatch in 2026 than in any year since the game’s debut.A \"story-driven era\"Blizzard EntertainmentThe next season spells the beginning of what Blizzard is calling a \"new story-driven era\" for Overwatch, starting with a year-long narrative arc called The Reign of Talon. All of the lore, heroes, events and so on that emerge over the next 12 months will be tied to the rise of Talon. The studio says this is the \"the first fully connected annual storyline in Overwatch history.\" A new arc will begin next year with Season 1 of 2027 (Blizzard is resetting the season counter when The Reign of Talon begins).Elsewhere, each role will be split into sub-roles, and the heroes in each will share a passive ability. For instance, \"initiator\" tanks heal more while they're in the air, several damage heroes can detect enemies that are below half health through walls after damaging them and some supports have excess ultimate charge that carries over after you use their most powerful ability.Also on the way soon is a \"meta event\" called Conquest. This is billed as a faction war between Overwatch and Talon that will run for five weeks, with dozens of loot boxes and other rewards (such as some legendary Echo skins) up for grabs. Blizzard EntertainmentBlizzard has overhauled the Overwatch interface too, with updated menus, a new hero lobby, a notification hub and the promise of faster navigation. Stadium will have some updates, such as refreshed ability icons and recommended builds based on global data that will be updated between rounds. Vendetta is joining that mode's roster as well.Along with all the new heroes and other updates, a Hello Kitty collaboration will run for two weeks starting on February 10 with themed cosmetics for several heroes. Lots of other cosmetics are in the pipeline, including Crimson Wolf weapon skins you can unlock using competitive points, and rainy day and Valentine's items. Shop items from the last six seasons are going into loot boxes, while mythic cosmetics for Mercy, Juno and Mei will be available in Season 1.Blizzard EntertainmentLooking further ahead, a Nintendo Switch 2 version of Overwatch will arrive alongside Season 2, which will start in April. Some heroes will be getting their second mythic skins, including Ana and Genji. Genji, Hanzo and Sojourn will have mythic weapon skins in the coming months. Two new maps, including a Japan Night one, for the main modes are coming, along with the return of post-match accolades. There’s so much on the way for my go-to game. I don't know how I'm going to be able to take a long-enough break from Overwatch to play cool indies ever again.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/overwatch-will-drop-the-2-as-jetpack-cat-and-four-other-heroes-arrive-on-february-10-184500327.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "The groundhog has predicted six more weeks of winter, which means more time indoors on our devices — and that means it's a great time to improve your cybersecurity. By subscribing to a virtual private network (VPN) and connecting every time you get online, you can keep your activity hidden from your ISP and any advertisers it may sell that data to — all while streaming sporting events and TV dramas from all across the globe. We strongly recommend using a VPN, but shopping for one takes some care. If you jump on the very first deal you see, you might get stuck with a substandard app. It's also easy to end up paying more than you meant to, since otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be. Even with all those caveats, there are some great bargains on the table. Many of the best VPNs — including our top pick, Proton VPN — have deals that save you anywhere from 70 to 87 percent on annual subscriptions. If you can believe it, there are even Valentine's Day sales running right now, because nothing is more romantic than taking care of your online privacy. Best VPN deals ExpressVPN Basic — $68.40 for a two-year subscription with four months free (81 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This discount, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 81 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price. ExpressVPN Advanced — $88.00 for a two-year subscription with four months free (77 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. As above, note that it renews at $119.95 annually. NordVPN Basic — $64.56 for a two-year subscription (76 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. NordVPN includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This deal gives you 70 percent off the two-year plan, but note that it renews at $139.08 per year. NordVPN Plus — $76.56 for a two-year subscription (78 percent off): NordVPN has also taken 70 percent off its Plus subscription. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. When this plan renews, you'll be paying $179.88 per year. Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark One — $61.83 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with four months free (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 28 months of CyberGhost for 79 percent off the usual price, but it'll renew at $56.94 per year. hide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. Windscribe — $69 for a one-year subscription (32 percent off): It's not nearly as steep a discount as some of the others on this list, but Windscribe was cheap to begin with, so 32 percent off its monthly price is a bigger savings than it might seem. As I just covered in a detailed Windscribe review, it's worth upgrading from the free service to get full access to Windscribe's all-real server network (and remove the free plan's data cap). Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. You can also get a shorter one-year subscription for $40 ($3.33 per month). Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. What makes a good VPN deal Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. NordVPN includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This deal gives you 70 percent off the two-year plan, but note that it renews at $139.08 per year. NordVPN Plus — $76.56 for a two-year subscription (78 percent off): NordVPN has also taken 70 percent off its Plus subscription. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. When this plan renews, you'll be paying $179.88 per year. Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark One — $61.83 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with four months free (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 28 months of CyberGhost for 79 percent off the usual price, but it'll renew at $56.94 per year. hide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. Windscribe — $69 for a one-year subscription (32 percent off): It's not nearly as steep a discount as some of the others on this list, but Windscribe was cheap to begin with, so 32 percent off its monthly price is a bigger savings than it might seem. As I just covered in a detailed Windscribe review, it's worth upgrading from the free service to get full access to Windscribe's all-real server network (and remove the free plan's data cap). Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. You can also get a shorter one-year subscription for $40 ($3.33 per month). Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. What makes a good VPN deal Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

          "title": "X's 'open source' algorithm isn't a win for transparency, researchers say",
          "standfirst": "When X's engineering team published the code that powers the platform's \"for you\" algorithm last month, Elon Musk said the move was a victory for transparency. \"We know the algorithm is dumb and needs massive improvements, but at least you can see us struggle to make it better in real-time and with transparency,\" Musk wrote. \"No other social media companies do this.\" While it's true that X is the only major social network to make elements of its recommendation algorithm open source, researchers say that what the company has published doesn't offer the kind of transparency that would actually be useful for anyone trying to understand how X works in 2026. The code, much like an earlier version published in 2023, is a \"redacted\" version of X's algorithm, according to John Thickstun, an assistant professor of computer science at Cornell University. \"What troubles me about these releases is that they give you a pretense that they're being transparent for releasing code and the sense that someone might be able to use this release to do some kind of auditing work or oversight work,\" Thickstun told Engadget. \"And the fact is that that's not really possible at all.\"Predictably, as soon as the code was released, users on X began posting lengthy threads about what it means for creators hoping to boost their visibility on the platform. For example, one post that was viewed more than 350,000 times advises users that X \"will reward people who conversate\" and \"raise the vibrations of X.\" Another post with more than 20,000 views claims that posting video is the answer. Another post says that users should stick to their \"niche\" because \"topic switching hurts your reach.\" But Thickstun cautioned against reading too much into supposed strategies for going viral. \"They can't possibly draw those conclusions from what was released,\" he says. While there are some small details that shed light on how X recommends posts — for example, it filters out content that's more than a day old — Thickstun says that much of it is \"not actionable\" for content creators. Structurally, one of the biggest differences between the current algorithm and the version released in 2023 is that the new system relies on a Grok-like large language model to rank posts. \"In the previous version, this was hard coded: you took how many times something was liked, how many times something was shared, how many times something was replied … and then based on that you calculate a score, and then you rank the post based on the score,\" explains Ruggero Lazzaroni, a pHD researcher at the University of Graz. \"Now the score is derived not by the real amounts of likes and shares, but by how likely Grok thinks that you would like and share a post.\"That also makes the algorithm even more opaque than it was before, says Thickstun. \"So much more of the decisionmaking … is happening within black box neural networks that they're training on their data,\" he says. \"More and more of the decisionmaking power of these algorithms is shifting not just out of public view, but actually really out of view or understanding of even the internal engineers that are working on these systems, because they're being shifted into these neural networks.\"The release has even less detail about some aspects of the algorithm that were made public in 2023. At the time, the company included information about how it weighted various interactions to determine which posts should rank higher. For example, a reply was \"worth\" 27 retweets and a reply that generated a response from the original author was worth 75 retweets. But X has now redacted information about how it's weighing these factors, saying that this information was excluded \"for security reasons.\" The code also doesn't include any information about the data the algorithm was trained on, which could help researchers and others understand it or conduct audits. \"One of the things I would really want to see is, what is the training data that they're using for this model,\" says Mohsen Foroughifar, an assistant professor of business technologies at Carnegie Mellon University. \"if the data that is used for training this model is inherently biased, then the model might actually end up still being biased, regardless of what kind of things that you consider within the model.\" Being able to conduct research on the X recommendation algorithm would be extremely valuable, says Lazzaroni, who is working on an EU-funded project exploring alternative recommendation algorithms for social media platforms. Much of Lazzaroni's work involves simulating real-world social media platforms to test different approaches. But he says the code released by X doesn't have enough information to actually reproduce its recommendation algorithm. \"We have the code to run the algorithm, but we don't have the model that you need to run the algorithm,\" he says.If researchers were able to study the X algorithm, it could yield insights that could impact more than just social media platforms. Many of the same questions and concerns that have been raised about how social media algorithms behave are likely to re-emerge in the context of AI chatbots.\"A lot of these challenges that we're seeing on social media platforms and the recommendation [systems] appear in a very similar way with these generative systems as well,\" Thickstun said. \"So you can kind of extrapolate forward the kinds of challenges that we've seen with social media platforms to the kind of challenges that we'll see with interaction with GenAI platforms.\"Lazzaroni, who spends a lot of time simulating some of the most toxic behavior on social media, is even more blunt. \"AI companies, to maximize profit, optimize the large language models for user engagement and not for telling the truth or caring about the mental health of the users. And this is the same exact problem: they make more profit, but the users get a worse society, or they get worse mental health out of it.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xs-open-source-algorithm-isnt-a-win-for-transparency-researchers-say-181836233.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Samsung’s 2025 was filled with new foldables, an ultra-thin new form factor and the launch of Google's XR platform. After making some announcements at CES 2026, the company is expected to host its first Galaxy Unpacked of the year in February to introduce the Galaxy S26 lineup. Official invites have yet to be shared, but the date is widely expected to be near the end of the month, probably on February 25 But as usual, we know a lot about what’s expected when Samsung does hold its next event.Whenever it does happen, Engadget will be covering Galaxy Unpacked live, and we'll most likely have hands-on coverage of Samsung's new smartphones soon after they're announced. While we wait for an official invite, here's everything we expect Samsung will introduce at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026.What is Unpacked 2026 taking place?But first, when is Unpacked going to happen? A recent image shared by leakster Evan Blass indicated Unpacked should be taking place on “February 25 2026.” Blass has a long history of credible leaks, which means this date is all but confirmed, and the main questions remaining would be — what time and in what timezone? We’re still waiting on Samsung for the official details, which should include answers to those questions.Galaxy S26, S26+ and S26 UltraSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on photoPhoto by Sam Rutherford/EngadgetSamsung's restrained approach to updating its phones will likely continue with the Galaxy S26. Based on leaked images of the new lineup, the company is not expected to radically reinvent the look of the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ or Galaxy S26 Ultra, and instead will stick with a similar design to what it used on the Galaxy S25. The phones will have a flat front screen and frame, with rounded corners and cameras housed in a vertical pill-shaped plateau on the back. Unlike Apple's move from the iPhone 16 Pro to the iPhone 17 Pro, the biggest difference here will likely be internal components like the screens, chips and camera sensors Samsung uses.Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip is expected to be in all Samsung Galaxy S26 phones, though Korean news site Yonhap News reports Samsung's relatively new Exynos 2600 chip could be used in some phones in the lineup depending on the region, a strategy Samsung has deployed in the past. Either way the new phones should be more performant than the previous generation, and in the case of the models with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, particularly good at on-device AI processing.I have compiled the most accurate comprehensive parameter comparison of Galaxy S25, S25+ and Galaxy S26、 S26+. Which one do you want to buy? pic.twitter.com/aQpoSvYjOz— Ice Universe (@UniverseIce) November 29, 2025One notable difference between the Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S25 could be the phone's screen. The new phone will reportedly feature a 6.3-inch FHD+ display according to specs shared by leaker Ice Universe, which makes it ever so slightly larger than the 6.2-inch display used on the Galaxy S25. The S26 will also allegedly come with 12GB of RAM, either 256GB or 512GB of storage and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery. Samsung isn't changing the cameras on the entry-level phone, though: leaks suggest it'll feature the same 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie camera as the previous generation. Changes appear to be even more minor on the Galaxy S26+. Other than the new Snapdragon chip, the phone will reportedly feature the same 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 4,900mAh battery, 12GB of RAM and the same camera array used on the base Galaxy S26.The difference between the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra is reportedly a bit clearer. According to Android Headlines, the new phone's cameras will be slightly more raised, and stand out thanks to a new metallic finish. Samsung may also switch back to using an aluminum frame on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, after using titanium frames on both the Galaxy S24 and S25 Ultras. Most importantly, to make the phone actually support Qi2 rather than only technically work with the standard when a case is attached, rumors suggest Samsung will remove the S Pen digitizer layer in the phone and adopt a new method for accepting stylus input. It's not clear what that new method will actually be, but it could let the Galaxy S26 Ultra more easily work with Qi2 accessories without losing its stylus.Android Headlines also recently shared what appear to be full image renders of the S26 series, and they generally line up with what has already been rumored, leaked and reported so far. If these pictures are accurate, they give us a clearer look at the camera bump and two color variants of the S26 Ultra.Fans of magnets may continue to be disappointed by Samsung if the latest rumors are accurate. Despite the launch of the Qi 2 wireless charging standard adding support for convenient magnetic alignment years ago, Samsung has yet to bring that feature to its phones. Though the S-series have the higher speed charging rates that the spec enables, Nieuwemobiel.nl is reporting that, due to images it received of cases with magnetic rings, the S26 series likely won’t have built-in magnets. Samsung has made these cases to add the magnetic capability to its S-series in the past, and the existence of the images of these accessories lends weight to the idea that the company will continue this approach.Galaxy Buds 4Galaxy Buds 3 Pro in case.EngadgetSamsung released the Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro in 2024, with a major redesign that brought them much more in line with Apple's AirPods. The Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro Samsung is rumored to be announcing soon won't necessarily change that, though they will feature a more compact case and less angular stems, according to leaked images from the Samsung Tips app.Support for head gestures to accept and decline calls, a feature Apple includes on the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4, is also rumored to work on both versions of the new Galaxy Buds. SamMobile reports the Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro may also ship with a new Ultra Wideband chip that will make them easier to find with Google's Find Hub network.Galaxy Z TrifoldYes, the TriFold has a crease, two in fact. But they still don't ruin the experience. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetSamsung announced the Galaxy Z TriFold in late 2025 without firm details of when the new smartphone-that-folds-into-a-tablet would be available in North America. That info came on January 27, when the company announced the TriFold would be available in the US on January 30, for a whopping $2,900. Considering we’ve already seen the device in person at CES 2026 and people are most likely to have had a chance to look at, if not buy the foldable for themselves by the time Unpacked rolls around, we don’t expect Samsung to spend too much time dwelling on it, if at all.Galaxy S26 EdgeAt just 5.8mm thick, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is one of the thinnest smartphones ever made. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetWhen the Galaxy S25 Edge was announced in 2025, it seemed possible that Samsung could replace its \"Plus\" smartphone with a unique form factor, just like Apple has opted to do with the iPhone Air. There have been conflicting reports on the matter, but it seems like Samsung will not be doing that with the Galaxy S26 Edge.Instead, the smartphone will reportedly remain another option, much like foldables are for customers not swayed by Samsung's traditional smartphones. The Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to feature a slightly different design than last year's model, according to Android Headlines, with a large rectangular camera plateau that's reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones, and the raised oval Apple used on the iPhone Air. Beyond that, the phone is also expected to be ever so slightly thinner at 5.5mm than the 5.8mm Galaxy S25 Edge.Bixby and other AI featuresSamsung already acts as a first place Google can show off new AI features for Android, but the company is reportedly exploring other AI partnerships, too. In June 2025, Bloomberg reported that Samsung was nearing a deal with Perplexity to integrate its AI-powered search engine across OneUI and its homegrown mobile browser. Perplexity already has a deal with Motorola on its Razr phones, so the only thing that would make a deal with Samsung unusual is the close relationship the company already has with Google.The company also accidentally announced a new version of its Bixby AI assistant, which will likely also be integrated with Perplexity and could serve as an alternative to Google Gemini. Both a new Bixby and a deeper integration with Perplexity seem like natural new software features to show off at Galaxy Unpacked.Update, January 27 2026, 11:55AM ET: This story has been updated to reflect the latest news around the Galaxy Z TriFold’s price and availability in the US.Update, January 30 2026, 12:45PM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks on the possible dates for Unpacked 2026.Update, February 02 2026, 11:30AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks with full image renders of the S26 trio of devices.Update, February 03 2026, 11:00AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks about the possible lack of magnetic support on the S26 series.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-the-s26-launch-130000556.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Samsung’s 2025 was filled with new foldables, an ultra-thin new form factor and the launch of Google's XR platform. After making some announcements at CES 2026, the company is expected to host its first Galaxy Unpacked of the year in February to introduce the Galaxy S26 lineup. Official invites have yet to be shared, but the date is widely expected to be near the end of the month, probably on February 25 But as usual, we know a lot about what’s expected when Samsung does hold its next event.Whenever it does happen, Engadget will be covering Galaxy Unpacked live, and we'll most likely have hands-on coverage of Samsung's new smartphones soon after they're announced. While we wait for an official invite, here's everything we expect Samsung will introduce at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026.What is Unpacked 2026 taking place?But first, when is Unpacked going to happen? A recent image shared by leakster Evan Blass indicated Unpacked should be taking place on “February 25 2026.” Blass has a long history of credible leaks, which means this date is all but confirmed, and the main questions remaining would be — what time and in what timezone? We’re still waiting on Samsung for the official details, which should include answers to those questions.Galaxy S26, S26+ and S26 UltraSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on photoPhoto by Sam Rutherford/EngadgetSamsung's restrained approach to updating its phones will likely continue with the Galaxy S26. Based on leaked images of the new lineup, the company is not expected to radically reinvent the look of the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ or Galaxy S26 Ultra, and instead will stick with a similar design to what it used on the Galaxy S25. The phones will have a flat front screen and frame, with rounded corners and cameras housed in a vertical pill-shaped plateau on the back. Unlike Apple's move from the iPhone 16 Pro to the iPhone 17 Pro, the biggest difference here will likely be internal components like the screens, chips and camera sensors Samsung uses.Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip is expected to be in all Samsung Galaxy S26 phones, though Korean news site Yonhap News reports Samsung's relatively new Exynos 2600 chip could be used in some phones in the lineup depending on the region, a strategy Samsung has deployed in the past. Either way the new phones should be more performant than the previous generation, and in the case of the models with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, particularly good at on-device AI processing.I have compiled the most accurate comprehensive parameter comparison of Galaxy S25, S25+ and Galaxy S26、 S26+. Which one do you want to buy? pic.twitter.com/aQpoSvYjOz— Ice Universe (@UniverseIce) November 29, 2025One notable difference between the Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S25 could be the phone's screen. The new phone will reportedly feature a 6.3-inch FHD+ display according to specs shared by leaker Ice Universe, which makes it ever so slightly larger than the 6.2-inch display used on the Galaxy S25. The S26 will also allegedly come with 12GB of RAM, either 256GB or 512GB of storage and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery. Samsung isn't changing the cameras on the entry-level phone, though: leaks suggest it'll feature the same 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie camera as the previous generation. Changes appear to be even more minor on the Galaxy S26+. Other than the new Snapdragon chip, the phone will reportedly feature the same 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 4,900mAh battery, 12GB of RAM and the same camera array used on the base Galaxy S26.The difference between the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra is reportedly a bit clearer. According to Android Headlines, the new phone's cameras will be slightly more raised, and stand out thanks to a new metallic finish. Samsung may also switch back to using an aluminum frame on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, after using titanium frames on both the Galaxy S24 and S25 Ultras. Most importantly, to make the phone actually support Qi2 rather than only technically work with the standard when a case is attached, rumors suggest Samsung will remove the S Pen digitizer layer in the phone and adopt a new method for accepting stylus input. It's not clear what that new method will actually be, but it could let the Galaxy S26 Ultra more easily work with Qi2 accessories without losing its stylus.Android Headlines also recently shared what appear to be full image renders of the S26 series, and they generally line up with what has already been rumored, leaked and reported so far. If these pictures are accurate, they give us a clearer look at the camera bump and two color variants of the S26 Ultra.Fans of magnets may continue to be disappointed by Samsung if the latest rumors are accurate. Despite the launch of the Qi 2 wireless charging standard adding support for convenient magnetic alignment years ago, Samsung has yet to bring that feature to its phones. Though the S-series have the higher speed charging rates that the spec enables, Nieuwemobiel.nl is reporting that, due to images it received of cases with magnetic rings, the S26 series likely won’t have built-in magnets. Samsung has made these cases to add the magnetic capability to its S-series in the past, and the existence of the images of these accessories lends weight to the idea that the company will continue this approach.Galaxy Buds 4Galaxy Buds 3 Pro in case.EngadgetSamsung released the Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro in 2024, with a major redesign that brought them much more in line with Apple's AirPods.

          "standfirst": "Apple’s long-rumored foldable iPhone hasn’t been announced yet, but after years of speculation, it seems like this device could finally be coming out soon(ish). Multiple sources claim that Apple could be targeting a late-2026 launch for its first foldable phone, and new rumors suggest the company is even already thinking about its second model, which could be a clamshell-style foldable iPhone.But of course, nothing is official yet. Plans can change, features can be dropped and timelines can slip. Still, recent reports paint the clearest picture yet of how Apple might approach a foldable iPhone and how it plans to differentiate itself from rivals like Samsung and Google.Here, we’ve rounded up the most credible iPhone Fold rumors so far, covering its possible release timing, design, display technology, cameras and price. We’ll continue to update this post as more rumors and details become available.When could the iPhone Fold launch?Rumors of a foldable iPhone date back as far as 2017, but more recent reporting suggests Apple has finally locked onto a realistic window. Most sources now point to fall 2026, likely alongside the iPhone 18 lineup.Mark Gurman has gone back and forth on timing, initially suggesting Apple could launch “as early as 2026,” before later writing that the device would ship at the end of 2026 and sell primarily in 2027. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also repeatedly cited the second half of 2026 as Apple’s target.Some reports still claim the project could slip into 2027 if Apple runs into manufacturing or durability issues, particularly around the hinge or display. Given Apple’s history of delaying products that it feels aren’t ready, that remains a real possibility.What will the iPhone Fold look like?Current consensus suggests Apple has settled on a book-style foldable design, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, rather than a clamshell flip phone.When unfolded, the iPhone Fold is expected to resemble a small tablet like the iPad mini (8.3 inches). Based on the rumor mill, though, the iPhone Fold may be a touch smaller, with an internal display measuring around 7.7 to 7.8 inches. When closed, it should function like a conventional smartphone, with an outer display in the 5.5-inch range.CAD leaks and alleged case-maker molds suggest the device may be shorter and wider than a standard iPhone when folded, creating a squarer footprint that better matches the aspect ratio of the inner display. Several reports have also pointed to the iPhone Air as a potential preview of Apple’s foldable design work, with its unusually thin chassis widely interpreted as a look at what one half of a future foldable iPhone could resemble.If that theory holds, it could help explain the Fold’s rumored dimensions. Thickness is expected to land between roughly 4.5 and 5.6mm when unfolded, putting it in a similar range to the iPhone Air, and just over 9 to 11mm when folded, depending on the final hinge design and internal layering.iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone AirEngadgetDisplay and the crease questionThe display is arguably the biggest challenge for any foldable phone, and it’s an area where Apple appears to have invested years of development.Multiple reports say Apple will rely on Samsung Display as its primary supplier. At CES 2026, Samsung showcased a new crease-less foldable OLED panel, which several sources — including Bloomberg — suggested could be the same technology Apple plans to use.According to these reports, the panel combines a flexible OLED with a laser-drilled metal support plate that disperses stress when folding. The goal is a display with a nearly invisible crease, something Apple reportedly considers essential before entering the foldable market.If Apple does use this panel, it would mark a notable improvement over current foldables, which still show visible creasing under certain lighting conditions.Cameras and biometricsCamera rumors suggest Apple is planning a four-camera setup. That may include:Two rear cameras (main and ultra-wide, both rumored at 48MP)One punch-hole camera on the outer displayOne under-display camera on the inner screenSeveral sources claim Apple will avoid Face ID entirely on the iPhone Fold. Instead, it’s expected to rely on Touch ID built into the power button, similar to recent iPad models. This would allow Apple to keep both displays free of notches or Dynamic Island cutouts.Under-display camera technology has historically produced lower image quality, but a rumored 24MP sensor would be a significant step up compared to existing foldables, which typically use much lower-resolution sensors.iPhone Fold’s hinge and materialsThe hinge is another area where Apple may diverge from competitors. Multiple reports claim Apple will use Liquidmetal, which is a long-standing trade name for a metallic glass alloy the company has previously used in smaller components. While often referred to as “liquid metal” or “Liquid Metal” in reports, Liquidmetal is the branding Apple has historically associated with the material.Liquidmetal is said to be stronger and more resistant to deformation than titanium, while remaining relatively lightweight. If accurate, this could help improve long-term durability and reduce wear on the foldable display.Leaks from Jon Prosser also reference a metal plate beneath the display that works in tandem with the hinge to minimize creasing — a claim that aligns with reporting from Korean and Chinese supply-chain sources.Battery and other components Battery life is another potential differentiator. According to Ming-Chi Kuo and multiple Asian supply-chain reports, Apple is testing high-density battery cells in the 5,000 to 5,800mAh range.That would make it the largest battery ever used in an iPhone, and competitive with (or larger than) batteries in current Android foldables. The device is also expected to use a future A-series chip and Apple’s in-house modem.PriceNone of this will come cheap, that’s for certain. Nearly every report agrees that the iPhone Fold will be Apple’s most expensive iPhone ever.Estimates currently place the price between $2,000 and $2,500 in the US. Bloomberg has said the price will be “at least $2,000,” while other analysts have narrowed the likely range to around $2,100 and $2,300. That positions the iPhone Fold well above the iPhone Pro Max and closer to Apple’s high-end Macs and iPads.Despite years of rumors, there’s still plenty that remains unclear. Apple hasn’t confirmed the name “iPhone Fold,” final dimensions, software features or how iOS would adapt to a folding form factor. Durability, repairability and long-term reliability are also open questions. For now, the safest assumption is that Apple is taking its time and that many of these details could still change before launch.

Instead of a place primarily inhabited by humans, the web may very soon be dominated by autonomous AI bots. A new report measuring bot activity on the web, as well as related data shared with WIRED by the Internet infrastructure company Akamai, shows that AI bots already account for a meaningful share of web traffic. The findings also shed light on an increasingly sophisticated arms race unfolding as bots deploy clever tactics to bypass website defenses meant to keep them out. “The majority of the Internet is going to be bot traffic in the future,” says Toshit Pangrahi, cofounder and CEO of TollBit, a company that tracks web-scraping activity and published the new report. “It’s not just a copyright problem, there is a new visitor emerging on the Internet.”Read full article Comments",

          "content": "On Thursday, Anthropic and OpenAI shipped products built around the same idea: instead of chatting with a single AI assistant, users should be managing teams of AI agents that divide up work and run in parallel. The simultaneous releases are part of a gradual shift across the industry, from AI as a conversation partner to AI as a delegated workforce, and they arrive during a week when that very concept reportedly helped wipe $285 billion off software stocks. Whether that supervisory model works in practice remains an open question. Current AI agents still require heavy human intervention to catch errors, and no independent evaluation has confirmed that these multi-agent tools reliably outperform a single developer working alone. Even so, the companies are going all-in on agents. Anthropic's contribution is Claude Opus 4.6, a new version of its most capable AI model, paired with a feature called \"agent teams\" in Claude Code. Agent teams let developers spin up multiple AI agents that split a task into independent pieces, coordinate autonomously, and run concurrently.Read full article Comments",

Now, Hamster Corporation is doing what Nintendo no longer will, by offering downloadable versions of retro console games for direct individual purchase on the Switch 2. As part of today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, Hamster announced a new Console Archives line of emulated classics available for download starting today on the Switch 2 and next week on the PlayStation 5 (sorry, Xbox and OG Switch fans). So far that lineup only includes the original PlayStation snowboarding title Cool Boarders for $12 and the NES action platformer Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos for $8, but Hamster promises more obscure games, including Doraemon and Sonic Wings Special, will be available in the future. If the name Hamster Corporation sounds familiar, it's because the company is behind the Arcade Archive series, which has repackaged individual arcade games for purchase and emulated play on modern consoles since 2014. That effort, which celebrated its 500th release in December, even includes some of Nintendo's classic arcade titles, which the Switch-maker never officially released on the original Virtual Console.Read full article Comments",

Founded in 2013 to archive the \"aesthetic awesomeness\" of GeoCities websites, Neocities keeps the spirit of the 1990s Internet alive. It lets users design free websites without relying on standardized templates devoid of personality. For hundreds of thousands of people building websites around art, niche fandoms, and special expertise—or simply seeking a place to get a little weird online—Neocities provides a blank canvas that can be endlessly personalized when compared to a Facebook page. Delighted visitors discovering these sites are more likely to navigate by hovering flashing pointers over a web of spinning GIFs than clicking a hamburger menu or infinitely scrolling. That's the style of Internet that Kyle Drake, Neocities' founder, strives to maintain. So he was surprised when he noticed that Bing was curiously blocking Neocities sites last summer. At first, the issue seemed resolved by contacting Microsoft, but after receiving more recent reports that users were struggling to log in, Drake discovered that another complete block was implemented in January. Even more concerning, he saw that after delisting the front page, Bing had started pointing users to a copycat site where he was alarmed to learn they were providing their login credentials.Read full article Comments",

At present, the only Android phones that can initiate an AirDrop session with Apple devices are Google's latest Pixel 10 devices.

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University presented evidence in a new paper published in the journal Science that a bonobo named Kanzi was also able to participate in pretending to hold a tea party. For the authors, this suggests that apes are capable of using their imagination just like human toddlers. “It really is game-changing that their mental lives go beyond the here and now,\" said co-author Christopher Krupenye. \"Imagination has long been seen as a critical element of what it is to be human, but the idea that it may not be exclusive to our species is really transformative. Jane Goodall discovered that chimps make tools, and that led to a change in the definition of what it means to be human, and this, too, really invites us to reconsider what makes us special and what mental life is out there among other creatures.\" Per Krupenye et al., by the age of two, human children are able to navigate imaginary scenarios like a tea party, pretending there is real tea present even if the teapot and cups are actually empty. Cognitively speaking, it's an example of secondary representation, because it involves decoupling an imagined or simulated state (pretending there is actual tea in the cup) with the reality (the cup is empty).Read full article Comments",

She told the doctors that for six weeks she felt like she had something in her eyes, and they were watery.

In the latest issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, doctors report her eye-opening case—and its unexpected solution. (You can see images of her eyelids—flipped and recovered—here.

University of Oregon astrophysicist Yvette Cendes, a co-author of that 2022 paper, dubbed the black hole “Jetty McJetface” (a nod to the 2016 online British competition to name a research vessel Boaty McBoatface). Astronomers have continued to monitor it ever since. Far from fading again, the TDE has grown 50 times brighter, and that brightness continues to increase. The black hole's energy emission might not peak until 2027, according to a new paper published in the Astrophysical Journal. As we've previously discussed, it’s a popular misconception that black holes behave like cosmic vacuum cleaners, ravenously sucking up any matter in their surroundings. In reality, only stuff that passes beyond the event horizon—including light—is swallowed up and can’t escape, although black holes are also messy eaters. That means that part of an object’s matter is actually ejected out in a powerful jet.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Russian-state hackers wasted no time exploiting a critical Microsoft Office vulnerability that allowed them to compromise the devices inside diplomatic, maritime, and transport organizations in more than half a dozen countries, researchers said Wednesday. The threat group, tracked under names including APT28, Fancy Bear, Sednit, Forest Blizzard, and Sofacy, pounced on the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-21509, less than 48 hours after Microsoft released an urgent, unscheduled security update late last month, the researchers said. After reverse-engineering the patch, group members wrote an advanced exploit that installed one of two never-before-seen backdoor implants. Stealth, speed, and precision The entire campaign was designed to make the compromise undetectable to endpoint protection. Besides being novel, the exploits and payloads were encrypted and ran in memory, making their malice hard to spot. The initial infection vector came from previously compromised government accounts from multiple countries and were likely familiar to the targeted email holders. Command and control channels were hosted in legitimate cloud services that are typically allow-listed inside sensitive networks.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Electric vehicle enthusiasts are probably right to feel a little disheartened about the state of the United States' transition to EVs. But they should take heart that our region is an outlier. The other side of the Atlantic still seems relatively positive about the whole idea, even as Europe's car market recovers more slowly from the pandemic than the rest of the world. Last year, overall vehicle sales in Europe barely ticked up, rising 2.2 percent from 2024. EV sales, meanwhile, increased by 29 percent, bringing market share to an impressive 19.5 percent. That's according to data from automotive analyst JATO Dynamics, which finds that the big winner has been Volkswagen. Last year, its EVs outsold those from Tesla for the first time as sales of VW's electric offering grew by 56 percent, while Tesla's shrank by 27 percent. To put that into concrete numbers, VW sold 274,278 EVs to Tesla's 236,357. And that's just the VW brand itself—the automaker also owns Skoda (in 4th place, with 171,703 sales), Audi (5th place, 153,845 sales), Cupra (15th place, 79,269 sales), and Porsche (21st place, 32,715 sales). Not a bad effort, considering just over a decade has passed since VW's Dieselgate scandal.Read full article Comments",

The announcement comes alongside a Super Bowl ad campaign that mocks AI assistants that interrupt personal conversations with product pitches. \"There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them,\" Anthropic wrote in a blog post. The company argued that including ads in AI conversations would be \"incompatible\" with what it wants Claude to be: \"a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.\" The stance contrasts with OpenAI's January announcement that it would begin testing banner ads for free users and ChatGPT Go subscribers in the US. OpenAI said those ads would appear at the bottom of responses and would not influence the chatbot's actual answers. Paid subscribers on Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will not see ads on ChatGPT.Read full article Comments",

Those price spikes have only gotten worse since then, and they're beginning to trickle down to GPUs and other devices that use memory chips.

The authors also partnered with a perfumer to re-create what co-author Barbara Huber (of the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology and the University of Tübingen) dubbed “the scent of eternity.” Now Huber has collaborated with the curators of two museums to incorporate that eternal scent into exhibits on ancient Egypt to transform how visitors understand embalming. As previously reported, Egyptian embalming is thought to have begun in the Predynastic Period or earlier, when people noticed that the arid desert heat tended to dry and preserve bodies buried in the desert. Eventually, the idea of preserving the body after death worked its way into Egyptian religious beliefs. When people began burying the dead in rock tombs, away from the desiccating sand, they used chemicals like natron salt and plant-based resins for embalming. The procedure typically began by laying the corpse on a table and removing the internal organs—except for the heart. Per Greek historian Herodotus, “They first draw out part of the brain through the nostrils with an iron hook, and inject certain drugs into the rest” to liquefy the remaining brain matter. Next, they washed out the body cavity with spices and palm wine, sewed the body back up, and left aromatic plants and spices inside, including bags of natron. The body was then allowed to dehydrate over 40 days. The dried organs were sealed in canopic jars (or sometimes put back into the body cavity). Then the body was wrapped in several layers of linen cloth, with amulets placed within those layers to protect the deceased from evil. The fully wrapped mummy was coated in resin to keep moisture out and placed in a coffin (also sealed with resin).Read full article Comments",
