          "content": "Android devices are vulnerable to a new attack that can covertly steal two-factor authentication codes, location timelines, and other private data in less than 30 seconds. The new attack, named Pixnapping by the team of academic researchers who devised it, requires a victim to first install a malicious app on an Android phone or tablet. The app, which requires no system permissions, can then effectively read data that any other installed app displays on the screen. Pixnapping has been demonstrated on Google Pixel phones and the Samsung Galaxy S25 phone and likely could be modified to work on other models with additional work. Google released mitigations last month, but the researchers said a modified version of the attack works even when the update is installed. Like taking a screenshot Pixnapping attacks begin with the malicious app invoking Android programming interfaces that cause the authenticator or other targeted apps to send sensitive information to the device screen. The malicious app then runs graphical operations on individual pixels of interest to the attacker. Pixnapping then exploits a side channel that allows the malicious app to map the pixels at those coordinates to letters, numbers, or shapes.Read full article Comments",

A headset that looks to be a new Vision Pro has also appeared in FCC filings. But Apple may be starting to look beyond headsets toward a new type of product; it has apparently sidelined work on a lighter version of the Vision Pro to prioritize development on smart glasses instead.

          "content": "Netflix is no longer just a home for TV shows, movies, documentaries, and live WWE matches — soon, you’ll be able to stream video podcasts, too. The streaming giant announced on Tuesday that it’s partnering with Spotify’s podcast studio and The Ringer to offer 16 series on its platform, including The Bill Simmons Podcast, Conspiracy Theories, as well as The Ringer’s shows on the NFL, NBA, Fantasy Football, and F1. The podcasts will appear on Netflix in the US starting in 2026 before expanding to other countries. As part of the deal, the shows won’t appear “in their entirety” on YouTube, according to a report from The New York Times. Not only is YouTube Netflix’s biggest rival, it also tops Spotify and Apple Music as the most popular podcast streaming platform, raking in more than 1 billion listeners each month. Video podcasts, which show hosts during their conversations, are becoming increasingly popular as creators try to expand their reach across social media. Netflix won’t show commercial breaks for this first round of video podcasts, but Spotify’s ads within the podcasts will remain, the Times reports. The streaming service already produces several podcasts about its shows, like You Cannot Make This Up, Skip Intro, and We Have the Receipts, which also appear on YouTube. In April, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos hinted at bringing podcasts to the platform during an earnings call, saying, “As the popularity of video podcasts grow, I suspect you&#8217;ll see some of them find their way to Netflix.” It sounds like Spotify has more plans to expand the reach of its podcasts, too, as the company says it aims to “bring similar opportunities to a wider range of creators” in the future.

          "content": "OpenAI will soon allow “erotica” for ChatGPT users who verify their age on the platform. In an X post on Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company will add support for mature conversations when it launches age-gating in December. “As we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our ‘treat adult users like adults’ principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,” Altman writes. Earlier this month, OpenAI hinted at allowing developers to create “mature” ChatGPT apps after it implements the “appropriate age verification and controls.” OpenAI isn’t the only company dipping into erotica, as Elon Musk’s xAI previously launched flirty AI companions, which appear as 3D anime models in the Grok app. Along with the addition of “erotica”, OpenAI also plans on launching a new version of ChatGPT that “behaves more like what people liked about 4o.” Just one day after making GPT-5 the default model powering ChatGPT, OpenAI brought back GPT-4o as an option after people complained the new model was less personable. Altman said OpenAI made ChatGPT “pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues,” adding that the company realized this change made the chatbot “less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems.” OpenAI has since launched tools to “better detect” when a user is in mental distress. OpenAI also announced the formation of a council on “well-being and AI” to help shape OpenAI’s response to “complex or sensitive” scenarios. The council is comprised of a team of eight researchers and experts who study the impact of technology and AI on mental health. But, as Ars Technica points out, it doesn’t include any suicide prevention experts, many of whom recently called on OpenAI to roll out additional safeguards for users with suicidal thoughts. “Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases,” Altman writes in his post on X.",

          "content": "Meta has removed a Facebook page dedicated to tracking Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) action in Chicago after the Justice Department got involved. Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X Tuesday that Facebook had taken down an unnamed “large group page that was being used to dox and target” ICE agents after outreach from the DOJ. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone confirmed the group, which he did not identify, “was removed for violating our policies against coordinated harm.” Its removal follows Apple and Google blocking ICE-tracking apps, also following government demands. The DOJ declined to comment beyond Bondi’s post, and ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether specific credible threats were made to ICE agents on the page. The DOJ appears to have taken action after Laura Loomer, a right-wing influencer who has led several campaigns against federal workers she deems disloyal to Trump, posted about a Facebook group called “ICE Sighting- Chicagoland” that she claimed “is providing location updates on ICE raids and ICE agent locations in the Chicago area.” While neither the DOJ nor Meta confirmed the name of the group taken down, Loomer claimed a DOJ source told her the agency had seen her post and contacted Meta about such pages. As President Donald Trump has ramped up immigration enforcement across the country, including through more aggressive tactics like workplace raids, several tools and community groups have popped up to alert people to ICE’s presence in their area. The ICEBlock app used to anonymously report ICE sightings rose to the top of Apple’s app store this summer before it was similarly removed by Apple after the DOJ reached out, with Bondi claiming it was “designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs.” ICEBlock developer Joshua Aaron told Fox News Digital it was “patently false” that the app “served to harm law enforcement officers.” Bondi’s statement raises questions about whether the government engaged in illegal jawboning As private sector businesses, Apple and Meta can generally legally remove groups or apps as they see fit. But Bondi’s statement raises questions about whether the government engaged in illegal jawboning, or pressuring private actors to take down legal speech. It’s not clear precisely what the DOJ said to platforms that prompted them to take action, or whether Meta might have removed the page even without government intervention. But the administration has recently suggested that a broad range of speech might constitute actionable support for domestic terrorism and pledged to crack down on it. The incident is particularly notable since President Donald Trump and other Republicans have repeatedly characterized the Biden administration’s outreach to tech platforms over covid and voting misinformation as censorship, slamming the government’s role in flagging posts they labeled harmful to voting engagement or public health. Conservative state AGs sued the administration in a case that went all the way to the Supreme Court, which did not find a “concrete link” between the platforms’ removal decisions and the government’s communication with the tech executives. There’s also little direct evidence that ICE-tracking tools have led to violence. The administration amped up pressure after claiming that a shooter at a Dallas field office in September used tracking apps, but it’s unclear what, if any, role they played in the attack (which led to the deaths of two detainees and no ICE officers). ICE agents have experienced more assaults as their presence in American communities has increased, but to a far lower degree than the government has claimed, a recent National Public Radio report found.",

That doesn't mean these PCs will suddenly stop working, but if you don't take action, it does mean your PC has received its last regular security patches and that Microsoft is washing its hands of technical support. This end-of-support date comes about a decade after the initial release of Windows 10, which is typical for most Windows versions. But it comes just four years after Windows 10 was replaced by Windows 11, a version with stricter system requirements that left many older-but-still-functional PCs with no officially supported upgrade path. As a result, Windows 10 still runs on roughly 40 percent of the world's Windows PCs (or around a third of US-based PCs), according to StatCounter data. But this end-of-support date also isn't set in stone. Home users with Windows 10 PCs can enroll in Microsoft's Extended Security Updates (ESU) program, which extends the support timeline by another year. We've published directions for how to do this here—while you do need one of the Microsoft accounts that the company is always pushing, it's relatively trivial to enroll in the ESU program for free.Read full article Comments",

You can use this feature to modify images with just a prompt, and now you don't even need to go to Gemini to use it. Google says Nano Banana is now coming to search, Google Photos, and NotebookLM. The AI image editor is coming to search via Lens and AI Mode. For Lens, you can simply open the app (iOS and Android) and snap a photo to get started. When the rollout is complete, you'll see a \"Create\" button at the bottom, with a banana icon. Tap that to enter a prompt, telling the AI how you'd like the photo changed. When you begin an edit in Lens, the Google app will display the results and offer the chance for follow-up edits in the AI Mode interface. Google is always looking for more ways to get people plugged into its conversational search bot, so there's also a separate way to access Nano Banana there. Simply select the \"Create image\" tool and enter your prompt to create an image. You can then continue the conversation to have Nano Banana change the image.Read full article Comments",

Its biggest selling point is likely its large integrated memory that can run larger AI models than consumer GPUs. Nvidia will begin taking orders for the DGX Spark on Wednesday, October 15, through its website, with systems also available from manufacturing partners and select US retail stores. The DGX Spark, which Nvidia previewed as \"Project DIGITS\" in January and formally named in May, represents Nvidia's attempt to create a new category of desktop computer workstation specifically for AI development.Read full article Comments",

Ironically, though, the end of the clean vehicle tax credit on September 30 actually spurred the sales of EVs, as customers rushed to dealerships to take advantage of the soon-to-disappear $7,500 credit. Predictions for EV sales going forward aren't so rosy, and automakers are reacting by adjusting their product portfolio plans. Today, General Motors revealed that will result in a $1.6 billion hit to its balance sheet when it reports its Q3 results late this month, according to its 8-K. Q3 was a decent one for GM, with sales up 8 percent year on year and up 10 percent for the year to date. GM EV sales look even better: up 104 percent for the year to date compared to the first nine months of 2024, with nearly 145,000 electric Cadillacs, Chevrolets, and GMCs finding homes.Read full article Comments",

The company never actually defines what it means by \"bias.\" And its evaluation axes show that it's focused on stopping ChatGPT from several behaviors: acting like it has personal political opinions, amplifying users' emotional political language, and providing one-sided coverage of contested topics.Read full article Comments",

Moments later, the 404-foot-tall (123.1-meter) rocket began a vertical climb away from SpaceX's test site in Starbase, Texas, near the US-Mexico border. From then on, the rocket executed its flight plan like clockwork. This was arguably SpaceX's most successful Starship test flight to date.

No one doubts the day will come, but as the now-common joke in cryptography circles observes, experts have been forecasting this cryptocalypse will arrive in the next 15 to 30 years for the past 30 years. The uncertainty has created something of an existential dilemma: Should network architects spend the billions of dollars required to wean themselves off quantum-vulnerable algorithms now, or should they prioritize their limited security budgets fighting more immediate threats such as ransomware and espionage attacks? Given the expense and no clear deadline, it’s little wonder that less than half of all TLS connections made inside the Cloudflare network and only 18 percent of Fortune 500 networks support quantum-resistant TLS connections. It's all but certain that many fewer organizations still are supporting quantum-ready encryption in less prominent protocols.
