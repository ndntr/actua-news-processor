          "standfirst": "Researchers at Nvidia have developed a technique that can reduce the memory costs of large language model reasoning by up to eight times. Their technique, called dynamic memory sparsification (DMS), compresses the key value (KV) cache, the temporary memory LLMs generate and store as they process prompts and reason through problems and documents.While researchers have proposed various methods to compress this cache before, most struggle to do so without degrading the model&#x27;s intelligence. Nvidia&#x27;s approach manages to discard much of the cache while maintaining (and in some cases improving) the model&#x27;s reasoning capabilities.Experiments show that DMS enables LLMs to \"think\" longer and explore more solutions without the usual penalty in speed or memory costs.The bottleneck of reasoningLLMs improve their performance on complex tasks by generating \"chain-of-thought\" tokens, essentially writing out their reasoning steps before arriving at a final answer. Inference-time scaling techniques leverage this by giving the model a larger budget to generate these thinking tokens or to explore multiple potential reasoning paths in parallel.However, this improved reasoning comes with a significant computational cost. As the model generates more tokens, it builds up a KV cache. For real-world applications, the KV cache is a major bottleneck. As the reasoning chain grows, the cache grows linearly, consuming vast amounts of memory on GPUs. This forces the hardware to spend more time reading data from memory than actually computing, which slows down generation and increases latency. It also caps the number of users a system can serve simultaneously, as running out of VRAM causes the system to crash or slow to a crawl.Nvidia researchers frame this not just as a technical hurdle, but as a fundamental economic one for the enterprise.\"The question isn&#x27;t just about hardware quantity; it&#x27;s about whether your infrastructure is processing 100 reasoning threads or 800 threads for the same cost,\" Piotr Nawrot, Senior Deep Learning Engineer at Nvidia, told VentureBeat.Previous attempts to solve this focused on heuristics-based approaches. These methods use rigid rules, such as a \"sliding window\" that only caches the most recent tokens and deletes the rest. While this reduces memory usage, it often forces the model to discard critical information required for solving the problem, degrading the accuracy of the output.\"Standard eviction methods attempt to select old and unused tokens for eviction using heuristics,\" the researchers said. \"They simplify the problem, hoping that if they approximate the model&#x27;s internal mechanics, the answer will remain correct.\"Other solutions use paging to offload the unused parts of the KV cache to slower memory, but the constant swapping of data introduces latency overhead that makes real-time applications sluggish.Dynamic memory sparsificationDMS takes a different approach by \"retrofitting\" existing LLMs to intelligently manage their own memory. Rather than applying a fixed rule for what to delete, DMS trains the model to identify which tokens are essential for future reasoning and which are disposable.\"It doesn&#x27;t just guess importance; it learns a policy that explicitly preserves the model&#x27;s final output distribution,\" Nawrot said.The process transforms a standard, pre-trained LLM such as Llama 3 or Qwen 3 into a self-compressing model. Crucially, this does not require training the model from scratch, which would be prohibitively expensive. Instead, DMS repurposes existing neurons within the model’s attention layers to output a \"keep\" or \"evict\" signal for each token.For teams worried about the complexity of retrofitting, the researchers noted that the process is designed to be lightweight. \"To improve the efficiency of this process, the model&#x27;s weights can be frozen, which makes the process similar to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),\" Nawrot said. This means a standard enterprise model like Qwen3-8B \"can be retrofitted with DMS within hours on a single DGX H100.\"One of the important parts of DMS is a mechanism called \"delayed eviction.\" In standard sparsification, if a token is deemed unimportant, it is deleted immediately. This is risky because the model might need a split second to integrate that token&#x27;s context into its current state.DMS mitigates this by flagging a token for eviction but keeping it accessible for a short window of time (e.g., a few hundred steps). This delay allows the model to \"extract\" any remaining necessary information from the token and merge it into the current context before the token is wiped from the KV cache.“The ‘delayed eviction’ mechanism is crucial because not all tokens are simply ‘important’ (keep forever) or ‘useless’ (delete immediately). Many fall in between — they carry some information, but not enough to justify occupying an entire slot in memory,” Nawrot said. “This is where the redundancy lies. By keeping these tokens in a local window for a short time before eviction, we allow the model to attend to them and redistribute their information into future tokens.”The researchers found that this retrofitting process is highly efficient. They could equip a pre-trained LLM with DMS in just 1,000 training steps, a tiny fraction of the compute required for the original training. The resulting models use standard kernels and can drop directly into existing high-performance inference stacks without custom hardware or complex software rewriting.DMS in actionTo validate the technique, the researchers applied DMS to several reasoning models, including the Qwen-R1 series (distilled from DeepSeek R1) and Llama 3.2, and tested them on difficult benchmarks like AIME 24 (math), GPQA Diamond (science), and LiveCodeBench (coding).The results show that DMS effectively moves the Pareto frontier, the optimal trade-off between cost and performance. On the AIME 24 math benchmark, a Qwen-R1 32B model equipped with DMS achieved a score 12.0 points higher than a standard model when constrained to the same memory bandwidth budget. By compressing the cache, the model could afford to \"think\" much deeper and wider than the standard model could for the same memory and compute budget.Perhaps most surprisingly, DMS defied the common wisdom that compression hurts long-context understanding. In \"needle-in-a-haystack\" tests, which measure a model&#x27;s ability to find a specific piece of information buried in a large document, DMS variants actually outperformed the standard models. By actively managing its memory rather than passively accumulating noise, the model maintained a cleaner, more useful context.For enterprise infrastructure, the efficiency gains translate directly to throughput and hardware savings. Because the memory cache is significantly smaller, the GPU spends less time fetching data, reducing the wait time for users. In tests with the Qwen3-8B model, DMS matched the accuracy of the vanilla model while delivering up to 5x higher throughput. This means a single server can handle five times as many customer queries per second without a drop in quality.The future of memoryNvidia has released DMS as part of its KVPress library. Regarding how enterprises can get started with DMS, Nawrot emphasized that the barrier to entry is low. \"The &#x27;minimum viable infrastructure&#x27; is standard Hugging Face pipelines — no custom CUDA kernels are required,\" Nawrot said, noting that the code is fully compatible with standard FlashAttention. Looking ahead, the team views DMS as part of a larger shift where memory management becomes a distinct, intelligent layer of the AI stack. Nawrot also confirmed that DMS is \"fully compatible\" with newer architectures like the Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) used in DeepSeek’s models, suggesting that combining these approaches could yield even greater efficiency gains.As enterprises move from simple chatbots to complex agentic systems that require extended reasoning, the cost of inference is becoming a primary concern. Techniques like DMS provide a path to scale these capabilities sustainably.\"We’ve barely scratched the surface of what is possible,\" Nawrot said, \"and we expect inference-time scaling to further evolve.\"",

          "standfirst": "Chinese AI startup MiniMax, headquartered in Shanghai, has sent shockwaves through the AI industry today with the release of its new M2.5 language model in two variants, which promise to make high-end artificial intelligence so cheap you might stop worrying about the bill entirely. It&#x27;s also said to be \"open source,\" though the weights (settings) and code haven&#x27;t been posted yet, nor has the exact license type or terms. But that&#x27;s almost beside the point given how cheap MiniMax is serving it through its API and those of partners.For the last few years, using the world’s most powerful AI was like hiring an expensive consultant—it was brilliant, but you watched the clock (and the token count) constantly. M2.5 changes that math, dropping the cost of the frontier by as much as 95%.By delivering performance that rivals the top-tier models from Google and Anthropic at a fraction of the cost, particularly in agentic tool use for enterprise tasks, including creating Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint files, MiniMax is betting that the future isn&#x27;t just about how smart a model is, but how often you can afford to use it.Indeed, to this end, MiniMax says it worked \"with senior professionals in fields such as finance, law, and social sciences\" to ensure the model could perform real work up to their specifications and standards.This release matters because it signals a shift from AI as a \"chatbot\" to AI as a \"worker\". When intelligence becomes \"too cheap to meter,\" developers stop building simple Q&A tools and start building \"agents\"—software that can spend hours autonomously coding, researching, and organizing complex projects without breaking the bank.In fact, MiniMax has already deployed this model into its own operations. Currently, 30% of all tasks at MiniMax HQ are completed by M2.5, and a staggering 80% of their newly committed code is generated by M2.5!As the MiniMax team writes in their release blog post, \"we believe that M2.5 provides virtually limitless possibilities for the development and operation of agents in the economy.\"Technology: sparse power and the CISPO breakthroughThe secret to M2.5’s efficiency lies in its Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than running all of its 230 billion parameters for every single word it generates, the model only \"activates\" 10 billion. This allows it to maintain the reasoning depth of a massive model while moving with the agility of a much smaller one.To train this complex system, MiniMax developed a proprietary Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework called Forge. MiniMax engineer Olive Song stated on the ThursdAI podcast on YouTube that this technique was instrumental to scaling the performance even while using the relatively small number of parameters, and that the model was trained over a period of two months.Forge is designed to help the model learn from \"real-world environments\" — essentially letting the AI practice coding and using tools in thousands of simulated workspaces. \"What we realized is that there&#x27;s a lot of potential with a small model like this if we train reinforcement learning on it with a large amount of environments and agents,\" Song said. \"But it&#x27;s not a very easy thing to do,\" adding that was what they spent \"a lot of time\" on.To keep the model stable during this intense training, they used a mathematical approach called CISPO (Clipping Importance Sampling Policy Optimization) and shared the formula on their blog.This formula ensures the model doesn&#x27;t over-correct during training, allowing it to develop what MiniMax calls an \"Architect Mindset\". Instead of jumping straight into writing code, M2.5 has learned to proactively plan the structure, features, and interface of a project first.State-of-the-art (and near) benchmarksThe results of this architecture are reflected in the latest industry leaderboards. M2.5 hasn&#x27;t just improved; it has vaulted into the top tier of coding models, approaching Anthropic&#x27;s latest model, Claude Opus 4.6, released just a week ago, and showing that Chinese companies are now just days away from catching up to far better resourced (in terms of GPUs) U.S. labs.Here are some of the new MiniMax M2.5 benchmark highlights:SWE-Bench Verified: 80.2% — Matches Claude Opus 4.6 speedsBrowseComp: 76.3% — Industry-leading search & tool use.Multi-SWE-Bench: 51.3% — SOTA in multi-language codingBFCL (Tool Calling): 76.8% — High-precision agentic workflows.On the ThursdAI podcast, host Alex Volkov pointed out that MiniMax M2.5 operates extremely quickly and therefore uses less tokens to complete tasks, on the order $0.15 per task compared to $3.00 for Claude Opus 4.6.Breaking the cost barrierMiniMax is offering two versions of the model through its API, both focused on high-volume production use:M2.5-Lightning: Optimized for speed, delivering 100 tokens per second. It costs $0.30 per 1M input tokens and $2.40 per 1M output tokens.Standard M2.5: Optimized for cost, running at 50 tokens per second. It costs half as much as the Lightning version ($0.15 per 1M input tokens / $1.20 per 1M output tokens).In plain language: MiniMax claims you can run four \"agents\" (AI workers) continuously for an entire year for roughly $10,000. For enterprise users, this pricing is roughly 1/10th to 1/20th the cost of competing proprietary models like GPT-5 or Claude 4.6 Opus.ModelInputOutputTotal CostSourceQwen 3 Turbo$0.05$0.20$0.25Alibaba Clouddeepseek-chat (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekdeepseek-reasoner (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekGrok 4.1 Fast (reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIGrok 4.1 Fast (non-reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIMiniMax M2.5$0.15$1.20$1.35MiniMaxMiniMax M2.5-Lightning$0.30$2.40$2.70MiniMaxGemini 3 Flash Preview$0.50$3.00$3.50GoogleKimi-k2.5$0.60$3.00$3.60MoonshotGLM-5$1.00$3.20$4.20Z.aiERNIE 5.0$0.85$3.40$4.25BaiduClaude Haiku 4.5$1.00$5.00$6.00AnthropicQwen3-Max (2026-01-23)$1.20$6.00$7.20Alibaba CloudGemini 3 Pro (≤200K)$2.00$12.00$14.00GoogleGPT-5.2$1.75$14.00$15.75OpenAIClaude Sonnet 4.5$3.00$15.00$18.00AnthropicGemini 3 Pro (>200K)$4.00$18.00$22.00GoogleClaude Opus 4.6$5.00$25.00$30.00AnthropicGPT-5.2 Pro$21.00$168.00$189.00OpenAIStrategic implications for enterprises and leadersFor technical leaders, M2.5 represents more than just a cheaper API. It changes the operational playbook for enterprises right now.The pressure to \"optimize\" prompts to save money is gone. You can now deploy high-context, high-reasoning models for routine tasks that were previously cost-prohibitive.The 37% speed improvement in end-to-end task completion means the \"agentic\" pipelines valued by AI orchestrators — where models talk to other models — finally move fast enough for real-time user applications.In addition, M2.5’s high scores in financial modeling (74.4% on MEWC) suggest it can handle the \"tacit knowledge\" of specialized industries like law and finance with minimal oversight.Because M2.5 is positioned as an open-source model, organizations can potentially run intensive, automated code audits at a scale that was previously impossible without massive human intervention, all while maintaining better control over data privacy, but until the licensing terms and weights are posted, this remains just a moniker. MiniMax M2.5 is a signal that the frontier of AI is no longer just about who can build the biggest brain, but who can make that brain the most useful—and affordable—worker in the room.",

MiniMax engineer Olive Song stated on the ThursdAI podcast on YouTube that this technique was instrumental to scaling the performance even while using the relatively small number of parameters, and that the model was trained over a period of two months.Forge is designed to help the model learn from \"real-world environments\" — essentially letting the AI practice coding and using tools in thousands of simulated workspaces. \"What we realized is that there&#x27;s a lot of potential with a small model like this if we train reinforcement learning on it with a large amount of environments and agents,\" Song said. \"But it&#x27;s not a very easy thing to do,\" adding that was what they spent \"a lot of time\" on.To keep the model stable during this intense training, they used a mathematical approach called CISPO (Clipping Importance Sampling Policy Optimization) and shared the formula on their blog.This formula ensures the model doesn&#x27;t over-correct during training, allowing it to develop what MiniMax calls an \"Architect Mindset\". Instead of jumping straight into writing code, M2.5 has learned to proactively plan the structure, features, and interface of a project first.State-of-the-art (and near) benchmarksThe results of this architecture are reflected in the latest industry leaderboards. M2.5 hasn&#x27;t just improved; it has vaulted into the top tier of coding models, approaching Anthropic&#x27;s latest model, Claude Opus 4.6, released just a week ago, and showing that Chinese companies are now just days away from catching up to far better resourced (in terms of GPUs) U.S. labs.Here are some of the new MiniMax M2.5 benchmark highlights:SWE-Bench Verified: 80.2% — Matches Claude Opus 4.6 speedsBrowseComp: 76.3% — Industry-leading search & tool use.Multi-SWE-Bench: 51.3% — SOTA in multi-language codingBFCL (Tool Calling): 76.8% — High-precision agentic workflows.On the ThursdAI podcast, host Alex Volkov pointed out that MiniMax M2.5 operates extremely quickly and therefore uses less tokens to complete tasks, on the order $0.15 per task compared to $3.00 for Claude Opus 4.6.Breaking the cost barrierMiniMax is offering two versions of the model through its API, both focused on high-volume production use:M2.5-Lightning: Optimized for speed, delivering 100 tokens per second. It costs $0.30 per 1M input tokens and $2.40 per 1M output tokens.Standard M2.5: Optimized for cost, running at 50 tokens per second. It costs half as much as the Lightning version ($0.15 per 1M input tokens / $1.20 per 1M output tokens).In plain language: MiniMax claims you can run four \"agents\" (AI workers) continuously for an entire year for roughly $10,000. For enterprise users, this pricing is roughly 1/10th to 1/20th the cost of competing proprietary models like GPT-5 or Claude 4.6 Opus.ModelInputOutputTotal CostSourceQwen 3 Turbo$0.05$0.20$0.25Alibaba Clouddeepseek-chat (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekdeepseek-reasoner (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekGrok 4.1 Fast (reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIGrok 4.1 Fast (non-reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIMiniMax M2.5$0.15$1.20$1.35MiniMaxMiniMax M2.5-Lightning$0.30$2.40$2.70MiniMaxGemini 3 Flash Preview$0.50$3.00$3.50GoogleKimi-k2.5$0.60$3.00$3.60MoonshotGLM-5$1.00$3.20$4.20Z.aiERNIE 5.0$0.85$3.40$4.25BaiduClaude Haiku 4.5$1.00$5.00$6.00AnthropicQwen3-Max (2026-01-23)$1.20$6.00$7.20Alibaba CloudGemini 3 Pro (≤200K)$2.00$12.00$14.00GoogleGPT-5.2$1.75$14.00$15.75OpenAIClaude Sonnet 4.5$3.00$15.00$18.00AnthropicGemini 3 Pro (>200K)$4.00$18.00$22.00GoogleClaude Opus 4.6$5.00$25.00$30.00AnthropicGPT-5.2 Pro$21.00$168.00$189.00OpenAIStrategic implications for enterprises and leadersFor technical leaders, M2.5 represents more than just a cheaper API. It changes the operational playbook for enterprises right now.The pressure to \"optimize\" prompts to save money is gone. You can now deploy high-context, high-reasoning models for routine tasks that were previously cost-prohibitive.The 37% speed improvement in end-to-end task completion means the \"agentic\" pipelines valued by AI orchestrators — where models talk to other models — finally move fast enough for real-time user applications.In addition, M2.5’s high scores in financial modeling (74.4% on MEWC) suggest it can handle the \"tacit knowledge\" of specialized industries like law and finance with minimal oversight.Because M2.5 is positioned as an open-source model, organizations can potentially run intensive, automated code audits at a scale that was previously impossible without massive human intervention, all while maintaining better control over data privacy, but until the licensing terms and weights are posted, this remains just a moniker. MiniMax M2.5 is a signal that the frontier of AI is no longer just about who can build the biggest brain, but who can make that brain the most useful—and affordable—worker in the room.",

          "title": "The best wireless earbuds for 2026",
          "standfirst": "Wireless earbuds are now the default option for everyday listening, whether you’re heading out for a commute, fitting in a workout or just watching videos at home. The best wireless earbuds combine reliable connectivity, comfortable fits and sound quality that holds up across music, calls and podcasts, all without the hassle of cables. Most are small enough to disappear into a pocket and pair quickly with phones, tablets and laptops.What sets one pair apart from another often comes down to priorities. Some earbuds lean heavily on active noise cancellation, while others focus on long battery life, compact charging cases or lower prices. Features like water resistance, customizable controls and app support can also make a real difference day to day. This guide breaks down the best wireless earbuds available now to help you find the right match for how you listen. Best wireless earbuds of 2026 What to look for in the best wireless earbuds When it comes to shopping for earphones, the first thing to consider is design or wear style. Do you prefer a semi-open fit like AirPods or do you want something that completely closes off your ears? If you’re shopping for earbuds with active noise cancellation, you'll want the latter, but a case can be made for the former if you want to wear them all day or frequent places where you need to be tuned in to the ambient sounds. The overall shape of earbuds can determine whether you get a comfortable fit, so can the size and weight, so you’ll want to consider all that before deciding. And remember: audio companies aren’t perfect, so despite lots of research, the earbud shape they decided on may not fit you well. Don’t be afraid to return ill-fitting earbuds for something that’s more comfortable. As wireless earbuds have become the norm, they’re now more reliable for basic things like consistent Bluetooth connectivity. Companies are still in a race to pack as much as they can into increasingly smaller designs. This typically means a longer list of features on the more premium sets of earbuds with basic functionality on the cheapest models. Carefully consider what you can’t live without when selecting your next earbuds, and make sure key items like automatic pausing and multipoint connectivity are on the spec sheet. You’ll also want to investigate the volume and touch controls as you’ll often have to sacrifice access to something else to make that adjustment via on-board taps or swipes. Some earbuds even offer app settings to tweak the audio profiles or firmware updates to improve performance over time. For those in the Apple ecosystem, features like auto-pairing with devices, especially with AirPods Pro 3, can be an added advantage, while Android users may want to look for models that offer similar cross-device functionality. When it comes to battery life, the average set of earbuds lasts about five hours on a single charge. You can find sets that last longer, but this is likely enough to get you through a work day if you’re docking the buds during lunch or the occasional meeting. You’ll want to check on how many extra charges are available via the case and if it supports wireless charging. Companies will also make lofty claims about call quality on wireless earbuds. Despite lots of promises, the reality is most earbuds still leave you sounding like you’re on speakerphone. There are some sets that deliver, but don’t get your hopes up unless reviews confirm the claims. Sound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. This is especially true if you're an audiophile. We understand this isn’t easy when most of us do a lot of shopping online, but trying on a set of earbuds and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer's remorse. If a store doesn’t allow a quick demo, most retailers have return policies that will let you take earbuds back you don’t like. Of course, you have to be willing to temporarily part with funds in order to do this. We also recommend paying attention to things like Spatial Audio, Dolby Atmos, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all earbuds support them, so you’ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you, especially if you plan to use them for playback of high-quality audio. How we test wireless earbuds The primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don’t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for earbuds is typically less than a full day, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). To judge audio quality, we listen to a range of genres, noting any differences in the sound profile across the styles. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess call quality, we’ll record audio samples with the earbuds’ microphones as well as have third parties call us. When it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds we’re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older buds. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of earbuds that we review. Other wireless Bluetooth earbuds we tested Sony WF-1000XM6 Since we established this best wireless earbuds guide, Sony’s current 1000X model has consistently been the top pick. However, with the WF-1000XM6, there are two key areas where the company’s latest flagship set doesn’t measure up well versus the competition. Overall ANC performance lags behind Bose, and even Sony’s own WF-1000XM5. Speaking of the M5, the company did well there to address the issues I had with fit when it switched to foam ear tips on the WF-1000XM4, but it regressed in that area on the M6. There’s still plenty to like in terms of features and sound quality, but there are also caveats to consider now that could be dealbreakers. Sony WF-C710N The WF-C710N is a set of compact and comfy earbuds that offer several of Sony’s best features. While the ANC performance is above average for this price ($120), sound quality isn’t as good as the company’s slightly more expensive options. Battery life fell below stated figures and call performance isn’t good enough to use these buds for work. Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 The newest version of the Powerbeats Pro have an improved, comfortable design, balanced bass and new H2 chips and a heart rate sensor inside. But heart rate support is currently limited on iOS. Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 The Galaxy Buds 3 combine ANC with an open-type design, which renders the noise-blocking abilities of the earbuds mostly useless. Still, there’s great low-end tone with ample bass when a track demands it. There are also lots of handy features, most of which require a Samsung phone. But at this price, there are better options from Google, Beats and Sony Sennheiser Momentum Sport I really like the overall shape of the Momentum Sport earbuds. They’re more comfortable than the Momentum True Wireless 4 and fit in my ears better. What’s more, the body temperature and heart rate sensors work well, sending those stats to a variety of apps. However, that sport-tracking feature works best with Polar’s app and devices, so there’s that consideration. Also, the audio quality and ANC performance isn’t as good as the MTW4, and these earbuds are pricey. Beats Solo Buds There’s a lot to like about the Solo Buds for $80. For me, the primary perk is they’re very comfortable to wear for long periods of time thanks to some thoughtful design considerations. You only get the basics here in terms of features and, as expected, the overall sound quality isn’t as good as the pricier models in the Beats lineup. You will get 18 hours of battery life though, since the company nixed the battery in the case and beefed up the listening time in the buds themselves. Bose Ultra Open Earbuds Bose created something very unique for this set of earbuds that allows you to stay in-tune with the world while listening to audio content. The clip-on design is very comfortable, but sound quality suffers due to the open-type fit, especially when it comes to bass and spatial audio. Audio-Technica ATH-TWX7 These stick buds have a compact design that’s comfortable to wear and the warm sound profile is great at times. However, overall audio performance is inconsistent and there’s no automatic pausing. Master & Dynamic MW09 Retooled audio, better ambient sound mode and reliable multipoint Bluetooth are the best things the MW09 has to offer. They’re expensive though, and you can find better ANC performance elsewhere. Wireless earbud FAQs What is considered good battery life for true wireless earbuds? Most wireless earbuds will last five hours on a single charge, at the least. You can find some pairs that have even better battery life, lasting between six and eight hours before they need more juice. All of the best wireless earbuds come with a charging case, which will provide additional hours of battery life — but you'll have to return each bud to the case in order to charge them up. Is sound quality better on headphones or earbuds? Comparing sound quality on earbuds and headphones is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. There are a lot of variables to consider and the differences in components make a direct comparison difficult. Personally, I prefer the audio quality from over-ear headphones, but I can tell you the sound from earbuds like Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 3 is also outstanding. Which wireless earbuds have the longest battery life? With new models coming out all the time, tracking the hours of battery life for each this can be difficult to keep tabs on. The longest-lasting earbuds we’ve reviewed are Audio-Technica’s ATH-CKS5TW. The company states they last 15 hours, but the app was still showing 40 percent at that mark during our tests. The only downside is these earbuds debuted in 2019 and both technology and features have improved since. In terms of current models, Master & Dynamic’s MW08 offers 12 hours of use on a charge with ANC off (10 with ANC on) and JBL has multiple options with 10-hour batteries. What wireless earbuds are waterproof? There are plenty of options these days when it comes to increased water resistance. To determine the level of protection, you’ll want to look for an IP (ingress protection) rating. The first number indicates intrusion protection from things like dust. The second number is the level of moisture protection and you’ll want to make sure that figure is 7 or higher. At this water-resistance rating, earbuds can withstand full immersion for up to 30 minutes in depths up to one meter (3.28 feet). If either of the IP numbers is an X, that means it doesn’t have any special protection. For example, a pair of wireless earbuds that are IPX7 wouldn’t be built to avoid dust intrusion, but they would be ok if you dropped them in shallow water. Which earbuds stay in ears the best? A secure fit can vary wildly from person to person. All of our ears are different, so audio companies are designing their products to fit the most people they can with a single shape. This is why AirPods will easily fall out for some but stay put for others. Design touches like wing tips or fins typically come on fitness models and those elements can help keep things in place. You’ll likely just have to try earbuds on, and if they don’t fit well return them. What wireless earbuds work with PS5? PlayStation 5 doesn’t support Bluetooth audio without an adapter or dongle. Even Sony’s own gaming headsets come with a transmitter that connects to the console. There are universal options that allow you to use any headphones, headset or earbuds with a PS5. Once you have one, plug it into a USB port on the console and pair your earbuds with it. Recent updates February 2026: Updated to include new top picks.

          "standfirst": "OpenAI on Thursday launched GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark, a stripped-down coding model engineered for near-instantaneous response times, marking the company&#x27;s first significant inference partnership outside its traditional Nvidia-dominated infrastructure. The model runs on hardware from Cerebras Systems, a Sunnyvale-based chipmaker whose wafer-scale processors specialize in low-latency AI workloads.The partnership arrives at a pivotal moment for OpenAI. The company finds itself navigating a frayed relationship with longtime chip supplier Nvidia, mounting criticism over its decision to introduce advertisements into ChatGPT, a newly announced Pentagon contract, and internal organizational upheaval that has seen a safety-focused team disbanded and at least one researcher resign in protest.\"GPUs remain foundational across our training and inference pipelines and deliver the most cost effective tokens for broad usage,\" an OpenAI spokesperson told VentureBeat. \"Cerebras complements that foundation by excelling at workflows that demand extremely low latency, tightening the end-to-end loop so use cases such as real-time coding in Codex feel more responsive as you iterate.\"The careful framing — emphasizing that GPUs \"remain foundational\" while positioning Cerebras as a \"complement\" — underscores the delicate balance OpenAI must strike as it diversifies its chip suppliers without alienating Nvidia, the dominant force in AI accelerators.Speed gains come with capability tradeoffs that OpenAI says developers will acceptCodex-Spark represents OpenAI&#x27;s first model purpose-built for real-time coding collaboration. The company claims the model delivers more than 1000 tokens per second when served on ultra-low latency hardware, though it declined to provide specific latency metrics such as time-to-first-token figures.\"We aren&#x27;t able to share specific latency numbers, however Codex-Spark is optimized to feel near-instant — delivering more than 1000 tokens per second while remaining highly capable for real-world coding tasks,\" the OpenAI spokesperson said.The speed gains come with acknowledged capability tradeoffs. On SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0 — two industry benchmarks that evaluate AI systems&#x27; ability to perform complex software engineering tasks autonomously — Codex-Spark underperforms the full GPT-5.3-Codex model. OpenAI positions this as an acceptable exchange: developers get responses fast enough to maintain creative flow, even if the underlying model cannot tackle the most sophisticated multi-step programming challenges.The model launches with a 128,000-token context window and supports text only — no image or multimodal inputs. OpenAI has made it available as a research preview to ChatGPT Pro subscribers through the Codex app, command-line interface, and Visual Studio Code extension. A small group of enterprise partners will receive API access to evaluate integration possibilities.\"We are making Codex-Spark available in the API for a small set of design partners to understand how developers want to integrate Codex-Spark into their products,\" the spokesperson explained. \"We&#x27;ll expand access over the coming weeks as we continue tuning our integration under real workloads.\"Cerebras hardware eliminates bottlenecks that plague traditional GPU clustersThe technical architecture behind Codex-Spark tells a story about inference economics that increasingly matters as AI companies scale consumer-facing products. Cerebras&#x27;s Wafer Scale Engine 3 — a single chip roughly the size of a dinner plate containing 4 trillion transistors — eliminates much of the communication overhead that occurs when AI workloads spread across clusters of smaller processors.For training massive models, that distributed approach remains necessary and Nvidia&#x27;s GPUs excel at it. But for inference — the process of generating responses to user queries — Cerebras argues its architecture can deliver results with dramatically lower latency. Sean Lie, Cerebras&#x27;s CTO and co-founder, framed the partnership as an opportunity to reshape how developers interact with AI systems.\"What excites us most about GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark is partnering with OpenAI and the developer community to discover what fast inference makes possible — new interaction patterns, new use cases, and a fundamentally different model experience,\" Lie said in a statement. \"This preview is just the beginning.\"OpenAI&#x27;s infrastructure team did not limit its optimization work to the Cerebras hardware. The company announced latency improvements across its entire inference stack that benefit all Codex models regardless of underlying hardware, including persistent WebSocket connections and optimizations within the Responses API. The results: 80 percent reduction in overhead per client-server round trip, 30 percent reduction in per-token overhead, and 50 percent reduction in time-to-first-token.A $100 billion Nvidia megadeal has quietly fallen apart behind the scenesThe Cerebras partnership takes on additional significance given the increasingly complicated relationship between OpenAI and Nvidia. Last fall, when OpenAI announced its Stargate infrastructure initiative, Nvidia publicly committed to investing $100 billion to support OpenAI as it built out AI infrastructure. The announcement appeared to cement a strategic alliance between the world&#x27;s most valuable AI company and its dominant chip supplier.Five months later, that megadeal has effectively stalled, according to multiple reports. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly denied tensions, telling reporters in late January that there is \"no drama\" and that Nvidia remains committed to participating in OpenAI&#x27;s current funding round. But the relationship has cooled considerably, with friction stemming from multiple sources.OpenAI has aggressively pursued partnerships with alternative chip suppliers, including the Cerebras deal and separate agreements with AMD and Broadcom. From Nvidia&#x27;s perspective, OpenAI may be using its influence to commoditize the very hardware that made its AI breakthroughs possible. From OpenAI&#x27;s perspective, reducing dependence on a single supplier represents prudent business strategy.\"We will continue working with the ecosystem on evaluating the most price-performant chips across all use cases on an ongoing basis,\" OpenAI&#x27;s spokesperson told VentureBeat. \"GPUs remain our priority for cost-sensitive and throughput-first use cases across research and inference.\" The statement reads as a careful effort to avoid antagonizing Nvidia while preserving flexibility — and reflects a broader reality that training frontier AI models still requires exactly the kind of massive parallel processing that Nvidia GPUs provide.Disbanded safety teams and researcher departures raise questions about OpenAI&#x27;s prioritiesThe Codex-Spark launch comes as OpenAI navigates a series of internal challenges that have intensified scrutiny of the company&#x27;s direction and values. Earlier this week, reports emerged that OpenAI disbanded its mission alignment team, a group established in September 2024 to promote the company&#x27;s stated goal of ensuring artificial general intelligence benefits humanity. The team&#x27;s seven members have been reassigned to other roles, with leader Joshua Achiam given a new title as OpenAI&#x27;s \"chief futurist.\"OpenAI previously disbanded another safety-focused group, the superalignment team, in 2024. That team had concentrated on long-term existential risks from AI. The pattern of dissolving safety-oriented teams has drawn criticism from researchers who argue that OpenAI&#x27;s commercial pressures are overwhelming its original non-profit mission.The company also faces fallout from its decision to introduce advertisements into ChatGPT. Researcher Zoë Hitzig resigned this week over what she described as the \"slippery slope\" of ad-supported AI, warning in a New York Times essay that ChatGPT&#x27;s archive of intimate user conversations creates unprecedented opportunities for manipulation. Anthropic seized on the controversy with a Super Bowl advertising campaign featuring the tagline: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\"Separately, the company agreed to provide ChatGPT to the Pentagon through Genai.mil, a new Department of Defense program that requires OpenAI to permit \"all lawful uses\" without company-imposed restrictions — terms that Anthropic reportedly rejected. And reports emerged that Ryan Beiermeister, OpenAI&#x27;s vice president of product policy who had expressed concerns about a planned explicit content feature, was terminated in January following a discrimination allegation she denies.OpenAI envisions AI coding assistants that juggle quick edits and complex autonomous tasksDespite the surrounding turbulence, OpenAI&#x27;s technical roadmap for Codex suggests ambitious plans. The company envisions a coding assistant that seamlessly blends rapid-fire interactive editing with longer-running autonomous tasks — an AI that handles quick fixes while simultaneously orchestrating multiple agents working on more complex problems in the background.\"Over time, the modes will blend — Codex can keep you in a tight interactive loop while delegating longer-running work to sub-agents in the background, or fanning out tasks to many models in parallel when you want breadth and speed, so you don&#x27;t have to choose a single mode up front,\" the OpenAI spokesperson told VentureBeat.This vision would require not just faster inference but sophisticated task decomposition and coordination across models of varying sizes and capabilities. Codex-Spark establishes the low-latency foundation for the interactive portion of that experience; future releases will need to deliver the autonomous reasoning and multi-agent coordination that would make the full vision possible.For now, Codex-Spark operates under separate rate limits from other OpenAI models, reflecting constrained Cerebras infrastructure capacity during the research preview. \"Because it runs on specialized low-latency hardware, usage is governed by a separate rate limit that may adjust based on demand during the research preview,\" the spokesperson noted. The limits are designed to be \"generous,\" with OpenAI monitoring usage patterns as it determines how to scale.The real test is whether faster responses translate into better softwareThe Codex-Spark announcement arrives amid intense competition for AI-powered developer tools. Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Cowork product triggered a selloff in traditional software stocks last week as investors considered whether AI assistants might displace conventional enterprise applications. Microsoft, Google, and Amazon continue investing heavily in AI coding capabilities integrated with their respective cloud platforms.OpenAI&#x27;s Codex app has demonstrated rapid adoption since launching ten days ago, with more than one million downloads and weekly active users growing 60 percent week-over-week. More than 325,000 developers now actively use Codex across free and paid tiers. But the fundamental question facing OpenAI — and the broader AI industry — is whether speed improvements like those promised by Codex-Spark translate into meaningful productivity gains or merely create more pleasant experiences without changing outcomes.Early evidence from AI coding tools suggests that faster responses encourage more iterative experimentation. Whether that experimentation produces better software remains contested among researchers and practitioners alike. What seems clear is that OpenAI views inference latency as a competitive frontier worth substantial investment, even as that investment takes it beyond its traditional Nvidia partnership into untested territory with alternative chip suppliers.The Cerebras deal is a calculated bet that specialized hardware can unlock use cases that general-purpose GPUs cannot cost-effectively serve. For a company simultaneously battling competitors, managing strained supplier relationships, and weathering internal dissent over its commercial direction, it is also a reminder that in the AI race, standing still is not an option. OpenAI built its reputation by moving fast and breaking conventions. Now it must prove it can move even faster — without breaking itself.",

          "title": "Google Chrome ships WebMCP in early preview, turning every website into a structured tool for AI agents",
          "standfirst": "When an AI agent visits a website, it’s essentially a tourist who doesn’t speak the local language. Whether built on LangChain, Claude Code, or the increasingly popular OpenClaw framework, the agent is reduced to guessing which buttons to press: scraping raw HTML, firing off screenshots to multimodal models, and burning through thousands of tokens just to figure out where a search bar is.That era may be ending. Earlier this week, the Google Chrome team launched WebMCP — Web Model Context Protocol — as an early preview in Chrome 146 Canary. WebMCP, which was developed jointly by engineers at Google and Microsoft and incubated through the W3C&#x27;s Web Machine Learning community group, is a proposed web standard that lets any website expose structured, callable tools directly to AI agents through a new browser API: navigator.modelContext.The implications for enterprise IT are significant. Instead of building and maintaining separate back-end MCP servers in Python or Node.js to connect their web applications to AI platforms, development teams can now wrap their existing client-side JavaScript logic into agent-readable tools — without re-architecting a single page.AI agents are expensive, fragile tourists on the webThe cost and reliability issues with current approaches to web-agent (browser agents) interaction are well understood by anyone who has deployed them at scale. The two dominant methods — visual screen-scraping and DOM parsing — both suffer from fundamental inefficiencies that directly affect enterprise budgets. With screenshot-based approaches, agents pass images into multimodal models (like Claude and Gemini) and hope the model can identify not only what is on the screen, but where buttons, form fields, and interactive elements are located. Each image consumes thousands of tokens and can have a long latency. With DOM-based approaches, agents ingest raw HTML and JavaScript — a foreign language full of various tags, CSS rules, and structural markup that is irrelevant to the task at hand but still consumes context window space and inference cost.In both cases, the agent is translating between what the website was designed for (human eyes) and what the model needs (structured data about available actions). A single product search that a human completes in seconds can require dozens of sequential agent interactions — clicking filters, scrolling pages, parsing results — each one an inference call that adds latency and cost.How WebMCP works: Two APIs, one standardWebMCP proposes two complementary APIs that serve as a bridge between websites and AI agents.The Declarative API handles standard actions that can be defined directly in existing HTML forms. For organizations with well-structured forms already in production, this pathway requires minimal additional work; by adding tool names and descriptions to existing form markup, developers can make those forms callable by agents. If your HTML forms are already clean and well-structured, you are probably already 80% of the way there.The Imperative API handles more complex, dynamic interactions that require JavaScript execution. This is where developers define richer tool schemas — conceptually similar to the tool definitions sent to the OpenAI or Anthropic API endpoints, but running entirely client-side in the browser. Through the registerTool(), a website can expose functions like searchProducts(query, filters) or orderPrints(copies, page_size) with full parameter schemas and natural language descriptions.The key insight is that a single tool call through WebMCP can replace what might have been dozens of browser-use interactions. An e-commerce site that registers a searchProducts tool lets the agent make one structured function call and receive structured JSON results, rather than having the agent click through filter dropdowns, scroll through paginated results, and screenshot each page.The enterprise case: Cost, reliability, and the end of fragile scrapingFor IT decision makers evaluating agentic AI deployments, WebMCP addresses three persistent pain points simultaneously.Cost reduction is the most immediately quantifiable benefit. By replacing sequences of screenshot captures, multimodal inference calls, and iterative DOM parsing with single structured tool calls, organizations can expect significant reductions in token consumption. Reliability improves because agents are no longer guessing about page structure. When a website explicitly publishes a tool contract — \"here are the functions I support, here are their parameters, here is what they return\" — the agent operates with certainty rather than inference. Failed interactions due to UI changes, dynamic content loading, or ambiguous element identification are largely eliminated for any interaction covered by a registered tool.Development velocity accelerates because web teams can leverage their existing front-end JavaScript rather than standing up separate backend infrastructure. The specification emphasizes that any task a user can accomplish through a page&#x27;s UI can be made into a tool by reusing much of the page&#x27;s existing JavaScript code. Teams do not need to learn new server frameworks or maintain separate API surfaces for agent consumers.Human-in-the-loop by design, not an afterthoughtA critical architectural decision separates WebMCP from the fully autonomous agent paradigm that has dominated recent headlines. The standard is explicitly designed around cooperative, human-in-the-loop workflows — not unsupervised automation.According to Khushal Sagar, a staff software engineer for Chrome, the WebMCP specification identifies three pillars that underpin this philosophy. Context: All the data agents need to understand what the user is doing, including content that is often not currently visible on screen. Capabilities: Actions the agent can take on the user&#x27;s behalf, from answering questions to filling out forms. Coordination: Controlling the handoff between user and agent when the agent encounters situations it cannot resolve autonomously.The specification&#x27;s authors at Google and Microsoft illustrate this with a shopping scenario: a user named Maya asks her AI assistant to help find an eco-friendly dress for a wedding. The agent suggests vendors, opens a browser to a dress site, and discovers the page exposes WebMCP tools like getDresses() and showDresses(). When Maya&#x27;s criteria go beyond the site&#x27;s basic filters, the agent calls those tools to fetch product data, uses its own reasoning to filter for \"cocktail-attire appropriate,\" and then calls showDresses()to update the page with only the relevant results. It&#x27;s a fluid loop of human taste and agent capability, exactly the kind of collaborative browsing that WebMCP is designed to enable.This is not a headless browsing standard. The specification explicitly states that headless and fully autonomous scenarios are non-goals. For those use cases, the authors point to existing protocols like Google&#x27;s Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. WebMCP is about the browser — where the user is present, watching, and collaborating.Not a replacement for MCP, but a complementWebMCP is not a replacement for Anthropic&#x27;s Model Context Protocol, despite sharing a conceptual lineage and a portion of its name. It does not follow the JSON-RPC specification that MCP uses for client-server communication. Where MCP operates as a back-end protocol connecting AI platforms to service providers through hosted servers, WebMCP operates entirely client-side within the browser.The relationship is complementary. A travel company might maintain a back-end MCP server for direct API integrations with AI platforms like ChatGPT or Claude, while simultaneously implementing WebMCP tools on its consumer-facing website so that browser-based agents can interact with its booking flow in the context of a user&#x27;s active session. The two standards serve different interaction patterns without conflict.The distinction matters for enterprise architects. Back-end MCP integrations are appropriate for service-to-service automation where no browser UI is needed. WebMCP is appropriate when the user is present and the interaction benefits from shared visual context — which describes the majority of consumer-facing web interactions that enterprises care about.What comes next: From flag to standardWebMCP is currently available in Chrome 146 Canary behind the \"WebMCP for testing\" flag at chrome://flags. Developers can join the Chrome Early Preview Program for access to documentation and demos. Other browsers have not yet announced implementation timelines, though Microsoft&#x27;s active co-authorship of the specification suggests Edge support is likely.Industry observers expect formal browser announcements by mid-to-late 2026, with Google Cloud Next and Google I/O as probable venues for broader rollout announcements.

          "content": "When an AI agent visits a website, it’s essentially a tourist who doesn’t speak the local language. Whether built on LangChain, Claude Code, or the increasingly popular OpenClaw framework, the agent is reduced to guessing which buttons to press: scraping raw HTML, firing off screenshots to multimodal models, and burning through thousands of tokens just to figure out where a search bar is.That era may be ending. Earlier this week, the Google Chrome team launched WebMCP — Web Model Context Protocol — as an early preview in Chrome 146 Canary. WebMCP, which was developed jointly by engineers at Google and Microsoft and incubated through the W3C&#x27;s Web Machine Learning community group, is a proposed web standard that lets any website expose structured, callable tools directly to AI agents through a new browser API: navigator.modelContext.The implications for enterprise IT are significant. Instead of building and maintaining separate back-end MCP servers in Python or Node.js to connect their web applications to AI platforms, development teams can now wrap their existing client-side JavaScript logic into agent-readable tools — without re-architecting a single page.AI agents are expensive, fragile tourists on the webThe cost and reliability issues with current approaches to web-agent (browser agents) interaction are well understood by anyone who has deployed them at scale. The two dominant methods — visual screen-scraping and DOM parsing — both suffer from fundamental inefficiencies that directly affect enterprise budgets. With screenshot-based approaches, agents pass images into multimodal models (like Claude and Gemini) and hope the model can identify not only what is on the screen, but where buttons, form fields, and interactive elements are located. Each image consumes thousands of tokens and can have a long latency. With DOM-based approaches, agents ingest raw HTML and JavaScript — a foreign language full of various tags, CSS rules, and structural markup that is irrelevant to the task at hand but still consumes context window space and inference cost.In both cases, the agent is translating between what the website was designed for (human eyes) and what the model needs (structured data about available actions). A single product search that a human completes in seconds can require dozens of sequential agent interactions — clicking filters, scrolling pages, parsing results — each one an inference call that adds latency and cost.How WebMCP works: Two APIs, one standardWebMCP proposes two complementary APIs that serve as a bridge between websites and AI agents.The Declarative API handles standard actions that can be defined directly in existing HTML forms. For organizations with well-structured forms already in production, this pathway requires minimal additional work; by adding tool names and descriptions to existing form markup, developers can make those forms callable by agents. If your HTML forms are already clean and well-structured, you are probably already 80% of the way there.The Imperative API handles more complex, dynamic interactions that require JavaScript execution. This is where developers define richer tool schemas — conceptually similar to the tool definitions sent to the OpenAI or Anthropic API endpoints, but running entirely client-side in the browser. Through the registerTool(), a website can expose functions like searchProducts(query, filters) or orderPrints(copies, page_size) with full parameter schemas and natural language descriptions.The key insight is that a single tool call through WebMCP can replace what might have been dozens of browser-use interactions. An e-commerce site that registers a searchProducts tool lets the agent make one structured function call and receive structured JSON results, rather than having the agent click through filter dropdowns, scroll through paginated results, and screenshot each page.The enterprise case: Cost, reliability, and the end of fragile scrapingFor IT decision makers evaluating agentic AI deployments, WebMCP addresses three persistent pain points simultaneously.Cost reduction is the most immediately quantifiable benefit. By replacing sequences of screenshot captures, multimodal inference calls, and iterative DOM parsing with single structured tool calls, organizations can expect significant reductions in token consumption. Reliability improves because agents are no longer guessing about page structure. When a website explicitly publishes a tool contract — \"here are the functions I support, here are their parameters, here is what they return\" — the agent operates with certainty rather than inference. Failed interactions due to UI changes, dynamic content loading, or ambiguous element identification are largely eliminated for any interaction covered by a registered tool.Development velocity accelerates because web teams can leverage their existing front-end JavaScript rather than standing up separate backend infrastructure. The specification emphasizes that any task a user can accomplish through a page&#x27;s UI can be made into a tool by reusing much of the page&#x27;s existing JavaScript code. Teams do not need to learn new server frameworks or maintain separate API surfaces for agent consumers.Human-in-the-loop by design, not an afterthoughtA critical architectural decision separates WebMCP from the fully autonomous agent paradigm that has dominated recent headlines. The standard is explicitly designed around cooperative, human-in-the-loop workflows — not unsupervised automation.According to Khushal Sagar, a staff software engineer for Chrome, the WebMCP specification identifies three pillars that underpin this philosophy. Context: All the data agents need to understand what the user is doing, including content that is often not currently visible on screen. Capabilities: Actions the agent can take on the user&#x27;s behalf, from answering questions to filling out forms. Coordination: Controlling the handoff between user and agent when the agent encounters situations it cannot resolve autonomously.The specification&#x27;s authors at Google and Microsoft illustrate this with a shopping scenario: a user named Maya asks her AI assistant to help find an eco-friendly dress for a wedding. The agent suggests vendors, opens a browser to a dress site, and discovers the page exposes WebMCP tools like getDresses() and showDresses(). When Maya&#x27;s criteria go beyond the site&#x27;s basic filters, the agent calls those tools to fetch product data, uses its own reasoning to filter for \"cocktail-attire appropriate,\" and then calls showDresses()to update the page with only the relevant results. It&#x27;s a fluid loop of human taste and agent capability, exactly the kind of collaborative browsing that WebMCP is designed to enable.This is not a headless browsing standard. The specification explicitly states that headless and fully autonomous scenarios are non-goals. For those use cases, the authors point to existing protocols like Google&#x27;s Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. WebMCP is about the browser — where the user is present, watching, and collaborating.Not a replacement for MCP, but a complementWebMCP is not a replacement for Anthropic&#x27;s Model Context Protocol, despite sharing a conceptual lineage and a portion of its name. It does not follow the JSON-RPC specification that MCP uses for client-server communication. Where MCP operates as a back-end protocol connecting AI platforms to service providers through hosted servers, WebMCP operates entirely client-side within the browser.The relationship is complementary. A travel company might maintain a back-end MCP server for direct API integrations with AI platforms like ChatGPT or Claude, while simultaneously implementing WebMCP tools on its consumer-facing website so that browser-based agents can interact with its booking flow in the context of a user&#x27;s active session. The two standards serve different interaction patterns without conflict.The distinction matters for enterprise architects. Back-end MCP integrations are appropriate for service-to-service automation where no browser UI is needed. WebMCP is appropriate when the user is present and the interaction benefits from shared visual context — which describes the majority of consumer-facing web interactions that enterprises care about.What comes next: From flag to standardWebMCP is currently available in Chrome 146 Canary behind the \"WebMCP for testing\" flag at chrome://flags. Developers can join the Chrome Early Preview Program for access to documentation and demos. Other browsers have not yet announced implementation timelines, though Microsoft&#x27;s active co-authorship of the specification suggests Edge support is likely.Industry observers expect formal browser announcements by mid-to-late 2026, with Google Cloud Next and Google I/O as probable venues for broader rollout announcements. The specification is transitioning from community incubation within the W3C to a formal draft — a process that historically takes months but signals serious institutional commitment.The comparison that Sagar has drawn is instructive: WebMCP aims to become the USB-C of AI agent interactions with the web.

          "standfirst": "Lowering the cost of inference is typically a combination of hardware and software. A new analysis released Thursday by Nvidia details how four leading inference providers are reporting 4x to 10x reductions in cost per token.The dramatic cost reductions were achieved using Nvidia&#x27;s Blackwell platform with open-source models. Production deployment data from Baseten, DeepInfra, Fireworks AI and Together AI shows significant cost improvements across healthcare, gaming, agentic chat, and customer service as enterprises scale AI from pilot projects to millions of users.The 4x to 10x cost reductions reported by inference providers required combining Blackwell hardware with two other elements: optimized software stacks and switching from proprietary to open-source models that now match frontier-level intelligence. Hardware improvements alone delivered 2x gains in some deployments, according to the analysis. Reaching larger cost reductions required adopting low-precision formats like NVFP4 and moving away from closed source APIs that charge premium rates.The economics prove counterintuitive. Reducing inference costs requires investing in higher-performance infrastructure because throughput improvements translate directly into lower per-token costs.\"Performance is what drives down the cost of inference,\" Dion Harris, senior director of HPC and AI hyperscaler solutions at Nvidia, told VentureBeat in an exclusive interview. \"What we&#x27;re seeing in inference is that throughput literally translates into real dollar value and driving down the cost.\"Production deployments show 4x to 10x cost reductionsNvidia detailed four customer deployments in a blog post showing how the combination of Blackwell infrastructure, optimized software stacks and open-source models delivers cost reductions across different industry workloads. The case studies span high-volume applications where inference economics directly determines business viability.Sully.ai cut healthcare AI inference costs by 90% (a 10x reduction) while improving response times 65% by switching from proprietary models to open-source models running on Baseten&#x27;s Blackwell-powered platform, according to Nvidia. The company returned over 30 million minutes to physicians by automating medical coding and note-taking tasks that previously required manual data entry.Nvidia also reported that Latitude reduced gaming inference costs 4x for its AI Dungeon platform by running large mixture-of-experts (MoE) models on DeepInfra&#x27;s Blackwell deployment. Cost per million tokens dropped from 20 cents on Nvidia&#x27;s previous Hopper platform to 10 cents on Blackwell, then to 5 cents after adopting Blackwell&#x27;s native NVFP4 low-precision format. Hardware alone delivered 2x improvement, but reaching 4x required the precision format change.Sentient Foundation achieved 25% to 50% better cost efficiency for its agentic chat platform using Fireworks AI&#x27;s Blackwell-optimized inference stack, according to Nvidia. The platform orchestrates complex multi-agent workflows and processed 5.6 million queries in a single week during its viral launch while maintaining low latency.Nvidia said Decagon saw 6x cost reduction per query for AI-powered voice customer support by running its multimodel stack on Together AI&#x27;s Blackwell infrastructure. Response times stayed under 400 milliseconds, even when processing thousands of tokens per query, critical for voice interactions where delays cause users to hang up or lose trust.Technical factors driving 4x versus 10x improvementsThe range from 4x to 10x cost reductions across deployments reflects different combinations of technical optimizations rather than just hardware differences. Three factors emerge as primary drivers: precision format adoption, model architecture choices, and software stack integration.Precision formats show the clearest impact. Latitude&#x27;s case demonstrates this directly. Moving from Hopper to Blackwell delivered 2x cost reduction through hardware improvements. Adopting NVFP4, Blackwell&#x27;s native low-precision format, doubled that improvement to 4x total. NVFP4 reduces the number of bits required to represent model weights and activations, allowing more computation per GPU cycle while maintaining accuracy. The format works particularly well for MoE models where only a subset of the model activates for each inference request.Model architecture matters. MoE models, which activate different specialized sub-models based on input, benefit from Blackwell&#x27;s NVLink fabric that enables rapid communication between experts. \"Having those experts communicate across that NVLink fabric allows you to reason very quickly,\" Harris said. Dense models that activate all parameters for every inference don&#x27;t leverage this architecture as effectively.Software stack integration creates additional performance deltas. Harris said that Nvidia&#x27;s co-design approach — where Blackwell hardware, NVL72 scale-up architecture, and software like Dynamo and TensorRT-LLM are optimized together — also makes a difference. Baseten&#x27;s deployment for Sully.ai used this integrated stack, combining NVFP4, TensorRT-LLM and Dynamo to achieve the 10x cost reduction. Providers running alternative frameworks like vLLM may see lower gains.Workload characteristics matter. Reasoning models show particular advantages on Blackwell because they generate significantly more tokens to reach better answers. The platform&#x27;s ability to process these extended token sequences efficiently through disaggregated serving, where context prefill and token generation are handled separately, makes reasoning workloads cost-effective.Teams evaluating potential cost reductions should examine their workload profiles against these factors. High token generation workloads using mixture-of-experts models with the integrated Blackwell software stack will approach the 10x range. Lower token volumes using dense models on alternative frameworks will land closer to 4x. What teams should test before migratingWhile these case studies focus on Nvidia Blackwell deployments, enterprises have multiple paths to reducing inference costs. AMD&#x27;s MI300 series, Google TPUs, and specialized inference accelerators from Groq and Cerebras offer alternative architectures. Cloud providers also continue optimizing their inference services. The question isn&#x27;t whether Blackwell is the only option but whether the specific combination of hardware, software and models fits particular workload requirements.Enterprises considering Blackwell-based inference should start by calculating whether their workloads justify infrastructure changes. \"Enterprises need to work back from their workloads and use case and cost constraints,\" Shruti Koparkar, AI product marketing at Nvidia, told VentureBeat.The deployments achieving 6x to 10x improvements all involved high-volume, latency-sensitive applications processing millions of requests monthly. Teams running lower volumes or applications with latency budgets exceeding one second should explore software optimization or model switching before considering infrastructure upgrades.Testing matters more than provider specifications. Koparkar emphasizes that providers publish throughput and latency metrics, but these represent ideal conditions. \"If it&#x27;s a highly latency-sensitive workload, they might want to test a couple of providers and see who meets the minimum they need while keeping the cost down,\" she said. Teams should run actual production workloads across multiple Blackwell providers to measure real performance under their specific usage patterns and traffic spikes rather than relying on published benchmarks.The staged approach Latitude used provides a model for evaluation. The company first moved to Blackwell hardware and measured 2x improvement, then adopted NVFP4 format to reach 4x total reduction. Teams currently on Hopper or other infrastructure can test whether precision format changes and software optimization on existing hardware capture meaningful savings before committing to full infrastructure migrations. Running open source models on current infrastructure might deliver half the potential cost reduction without new hardware investments.Provider selection requires understanding software stack differences. While multiple providers offer Blackwell infrastructure, their software implementations vary. Some run Nvidia&#x27;s integrated stack using Dynamo and TensorRT-LLM, while others use frameworks like vLLM. Harris acknowledges performance deltas exist between these configurations. Teams should evaluate what each provider actually runs and how it matches their workload requirements rather than assuming all Blackwell deployments perform identically.The economic equation extends beyond cost per token. Specialized inference providers like Baseten, DeepInfra, Fireworks and Together offer optimized deployments but require managing additional vendor relationships. Managed services from AWS, Azure or Google Cloud may have higher per-token costs but lower operational complexity. Teams should calculate total cost including operational overhead, not just inference pricing, to determine which approach delivers better economics for their specific situation.",

          "title": "Sony WF-1000XM6 review: Facing tougher competition",
          "standfirst": "Sony’s 1000X earbuds have been at the top of Engadget’s best wireless earbuds list since we first published it. With each new generation, the company managed to retain its crown, primarily thanks to a massive collection of features and an effective mix of sound quality and active noise cancellation (ANC) performance. Today, Sony revealed the latest entry in the series, the WF-1000XM6, delivering yet another redesign both inside and out. The company’s tried and true formula of features and audio performance remains, but it may no longer be enough to elevate the M6 above the competition. Design For the third time in a row, Sony overhauled the 1000X earbuds’ design. While the WF-1000XM5 was a clear revision of the WF-1000XM4, the M6 is a departure from both of them. The company managed to reduce overall size even further by using a rounder, pill-shaped enclosure for the earbuds’ main housing. I certainly applaud Sony for making these as tiny as possible, but I’m still not a fan of the company’s foam ear tips. Sony introduced foam ear tips on the 1000XM4 earbuds and that led to an unstable fit during my testing. In fact, I ended up switching to the silicone M3 tips for a better feel. Things were slightly better on the M5, but the company regressed here on the M6. I tried every size of ear tips in the box and the fit test in the Sound Connect app only ever confirmed an air-tight seal in my right ear. This can impact sound quality and ANC performance, and the earbuds don’t feel like they’re sitting far enough inside my ears. I never got used to the fit in my three weeks of testing. The exterior panel of the WF-1000XM6 is still touch sensitive, accepting a variety of taps for playback controls, calls, noise settings and more. Sony also included a repeated tapping gesture that’s used for volume control. Keep tapping on the right earbud to raise the volume and do so on the left to lower it. My disdain for touch controls is well-documented at this point, but the M6 reliably and quickly responded without me having to repeat a tap sequence. WF-1000XM6 features The WF-1000XM6 accepts taps for touch-based controls. As is typically the case with its 1000X earbuds, Sony has loaded the M6 with features. Nearly all of these are holdovers from previous models, including Adaptive Sound Control that can automatically adjust settings based on your activity or location. Speak-to-Chat still pauses audio and activates ambient sound when you start talking, but it’s also still easily duped by coughs or clearing your throat. A quick access feature can put Amazon Music, Apple Music, Endel, Spotify and YouTube Music two or three taps away, depending on how you configure it. The M6 earbuds also allow you to accept and reject calls with head gestures and you’ll have the option to pipe in your own voice during a call. Sony retained its existing option of operating the earbuds with voice commands: If you say “Assistant,” you can then ask it to play, pause, skip and replay songs. It will also adjust the volume for you, but that’s the extent of its abilities. Sony included some handy power management features as well. First, there’s an Auto Power Save mode that will disable any custom EQ settings, DSEE Extreme upscaling, Speak-to-Chat and voice control/voice assistant to reduce power consumption when the M6 hits 20 percent battery remaining. A Battery Care tool will extend the life of the earbuds’ battery by stopping charging before it reaches 100 percent. Lastly, Automatic Power Off will turn the earbuds off when they’re outside of the case and haven’t been worn for some time. Basic conveniences like multipoint Bluetooth, wireless charging and IPX4 water resistance are also here. Wear detection is onboard and you can use Sony’s EQ presets to alter the sound profile, or make your own and save them for future use. The Sound Connect app puts the battery levels of the individual earbuds and the case front and center, and you can edit the main screen to hide the features displayed there if you don’t need them. Sound quality and ANC performance Sound quality is one of Sony's strengths and that continues on the M6. Billy Steele for Engadget If Sony’s long list of features is its top advantage over the competition, overall sound quality is number two. For the WF-1000XM6, the company built new drivers with soft edges for deeper bass and a more rigid, lightweight dome for clearer treble. There are also notches around the edges for “clearer and smoother” sound quality overall, according to Sony. And of course, DSEE Extreme upscaling helps to recover details lost to compression while 360 Reality Audio and Spatial Sound Optimization are available for more immersive listening. I found the M6 earbuds at their best with the stock EQ and DSEE Extreme active, much like I have on previous 1000X models. The sound is deep and warm, with thick bass that’s adequate without ever overpowering the mix. Highs cut through and there’s ample midrange, keeping those finer details from getting lost. Erika de Casier’s atmospheric Lifetime is a great example of what the WF-1000XM6 can do. Vocals seem to float over the top of the bassline and drums, with percussive piano chopping though and subtle synth details popping up throughout. When strings arrive on “Seasons,” the M6 ushers them into a prominent position rather than relegating them behind the beat. On the WF-1000XM6, the chaos of Spiritbox’s “Holy Roller” doesn’t get condensed to a messy heavy metal roar either. And there’s plenty of texture in the synth-driven noise of Nine Inch Nails’ “As Alive As You Need Me To Be.” Even more straightforward rock tracks like Jimmy Eat World’s “Bleed American” have ample punch, with a wide soundstage that never feels claustrophobic or sounds compressed. Overall, the WF-1000XM6 holds its own against the best-sounding earbuds you can buy right now, though some of the competition, like Technics, have an edge in the way they handle the subtlest of nuances in songs. If you were hoping for knock-out ANC abilities, I must report that the WF-1000XM6 isn’t the noise-canceling powerhouse that is Bose’s QC Ultra Earbuds. The M6 struggles mightily with human voices. While that’s the downfall of many ANC earbuds, you’ll want to keep it in mind if you plan to wear these in the office. I found I could also still hear constant noise sources like fans and white noise machines when wearing the M6 — items that the QC Ultra Earbuds combat effectively. Using the WF-1000XM6 for calls The WF-1000XM6 isn't as adept at calls as Sony advertises. Billy Steele for Engadget For calls, Sony says the M6 uses AI for both background noise reduction and voice capture with the beamforming microphones. What’s more, the earbuds are equipped with eight total mics for ANC and calls, plus bone conduction tech for improved voice pickup. Unfortunately, all of that doesn’t lead to stellar performance during calls. While the WF-1000XM6 is perfectly usable for voice and video calls, the overall quality is far from pristine. To make matters worse, the earbuds make you sound overly processed when you encounter significant background noise. Since the company prided itself on the upgrades here, the results are disappointing. Battery life Sony says the WF-1000XM6 will last up to eight hours on a charge or 24 hours when you factor in the full longevity of the charging case. During a battery test that I mostly ran with ANC active, I had no trouble hitting that single-charge figure. That’s with the volume around 75-80 percent and includes calls and virtual meetings where I switched over to ambient sound mode. It’s worth noting that I had DSEE Extreme upscaling active the entire time, which can impact battery life. Plus, if you use the aforementioned Auto Power Save mode, you can extend play time when you have about a quarter of a tank left. Going without some of the M6’s best features in the interest of having tunes for a workout or commute is a fair trade in my book. The competition The WF-1000XM6 is still a compelling option, but it's not the clear favorite anymore. Billy Steele for Engadget When sizing up the competition for the WF-1000XM6, you have to choose your priorities. Simply put, no other company offers the comprehensive suite of features that Sony does. That’s been true for a while now and it continues with this model. If you want the strongest active noise cancellation, that will be Bose’s second-generation QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. If the best sound quality is your goal, the Technics AZ100 is your best bet in this price range. I’ll also mention Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4 which offers great sound quality, respectable ANC and a comfier fit than the M6, but that set is almost two years old at this point. Wrap-up Sony continues its run of great earbuds with the WF-1000XM6, but this model isn’t the polished package that some of its predecessors were. The two most obvious places the company is lagging behind the competition is ANC performance and overall voice quality, not to mention my continued dissatisfaction with the fit that Sony’s foam tips provide. The M6 is also more expensive than the previous version was at launch, which makes it even harder to overlook any flaws. What you will get on the WF-1000XM6 is a ton of features, great sound quality and reliable touch controls in a smaller package. And for some, that might be enough to make you forget about the rest. The WF-1000XM6 is available today in silver and black for $330.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wf-1000xm6-review-facing-tougher-competition-160000652.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Sony’s 1000X earbuds have been at the top of Engadget’s best wireless earbuds list since we first published it. With each new generation, the company managed to retain its crown, primarily thanks to a massive collection of features and an effective mix of sound quality and active noise cancellation (ANC) performance. Today, Sony revealed the latest entry in the series, the WF-1000XM6, delivering yet another redesign both inside and out. The company’s tried and true formula of features and audio performance remains, but it may no longer be enough to elevate the M6 above the competition. Design For the third time in a row, Sony overhauled the 1000X earbuds’ design. While the WF-1000XM5 was a clear revision of the WF-1000XM4, the M6 is a departure from both of them. The company managed to reduce overall size even further by using a rounder, pill-shaped enclosure for the earbuds’ main housing. I certainly applaud Sony for making these as tiny as possible, but I’m still not a fan of the company’s foam ear tips. Sony introduced foam ear tips on the 1000XM4 earbuds and that led to an unstable fit during my testing. In fact, I ended up switching to the silicone M3 tips for a better feel. Things were slightly better on the M5, but the company regressed here on the M6. I tried every size of ear tips in the box and the fit test in the Sound Connect app only ever confirmed an air-tight seal in my right ear. This can impact sound quality and ANC performance, and the earbuds don’t feel like they’re sitting far enough inside my ears. I never got used to the fit in my three weeks of testing.

          "standfirst": "Presidents’ Day is a great time to buy appliances, mattresses and furniture as they are often on sale for the holiday.

The Apple Watch Series 11 is on sale for $299 for Presidents' Day, which is $100 off and the lowest price we've seen. A number of other Apple devices are on sale for the holiday as well. We named the Apple Watch Series 11 as our choice for best smartwatch overall. It scored a 90 in our review thanks to its 24 hours-plus of battery life and a thin, light design that's easy to wear. It also offers new health metrics, including Apple's hypertension alerts system and Sleep Score. The Apple Watch Series 11 deal is available on the 42mm case with a small/medium band. It also only includes GPS and four colorways: the Jet Black and Space Gray aluminum cases with a Black sport band, the Rose Gold aluminum case with a Light Blush sport band and the Silver aluminum case with a Purple Fog sport band. Among the other Presidents' Day Apple deals are mostly accessories: there are solid deals on AirPods, AirTags (the first-gen trackers, not the new, second-gen ones), the iPhone Air battery pack and even Apple's new crossbody straps that attach to the company's iPhone cases so you can essentially \"wear\" your iPhone like a bag. As with most Apple first-party accessories, you can find plenty of more affordable, third-party versions of them as alternatives. But if you're keen on outfitting your phone with Apple's own gear, it's best to wait for discounts like these.

          "content": "If you need a little help with your New Year's resolution to be more active, you can save on the latest Apple Watch right now. The Apple Watch Series 11 is on sale for $299 for Presidents' Day, which is $100 off and the lowest price we've seen. A number of other Apple devices are on sale for the holiday as well. We named the Apple Watch Series 11 as our choice for best smartwatch overall. It scored a 90 in our review thanks to its 24 hours-plus of battery life and a thin, light design that's easy to wear. It also offers new health metrics, including Apple's hypertension alerts system and Sleep Score. The Apple Watch Series 11 deal is available on the 42mm case with a small/medium band. It also only includes GPS and four colorways: the Jet Black and Space Gray aluminum cases with a Black sport band, the Rose Gold aluminum case with a Light Blush sport band and the Silver aluminum case with a Purple Fog sport band. Among the other Presidents' Day Apple deals are mostly accessories: there are solid deals on AirPods, AirTags (the first-gen trackers, not the new, second-gen ones), the iPhone Air battery pack and even Apple's new crossbody straps that attach to the company's iPhone cases so you can essentially \"wear\" your iPhone like a bag. As with most Apple first-party accessories, you can find plenty of more affordable, third-party versions of them as alternatives. But if you're keen on outfitting your phone with Apple's own gear, it's best to wait for discounts like these.

The Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones are down to $398, which is $62 off and the best discount we've seen since their debut. The sale applies to all three colorways. These easily topped our list of the best wireless headphones. They are, in a word, fantastic. The headphones are packed with premium features, like advanced ANC. There are a whopping 12 ANC microphones throughout and a brand-new chip to power the feature. The end result? It successfully blocks background noise at medium and high frequencies, including the human voice. The sound quality is extremely pleasing to the ears, thanks to new audio drivers and a team of mastering engineers that assisted with tuning. There are perforations in the driver's voice coil, which extends high frequency reproduction. The design has been upgraded from the previous iteration and we found them extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time, which is important with headphones. The battery gets around 30 hours, which is a fairly standard metric for this type of thing. The only real major nitpick here is the original asking price. It's tough to recommend any pair of headphones for $460, but a bit easier at under $400.

          "standfirst": "You have the best chance to save on streaming services during the holiday shopping season, but throughout the year, the occasional deal pops up that's worth considering. Case in point: this new Disney+ deal. New and eligible returning subscribers can sign up for the Disney+ Hulu bundle (with ads) for $10 for one month of access. That's $3 off the usual price of the bundle for one month, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the cost of each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month). We'd be remiss if we didn't mention that this isn't quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so. Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases. Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like The Bear, The Handmaid’s Tale and Only Murders in the Building, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV. The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately.

          "standfirst": "AirTags are basically an essential accessory for iPhone users who want to keep track of things like their keys, wallet and backpack. While it's easy enough to replace the battery in both versions of the AirTag, you may not want to have to rush to do so at the end of the battery's roughly two-year lifespan. That's where Elevation Lab's extended battery case for the AirTag comes in, and it's heavily discounted right now: it's 30 percent off and down to $16. The case usually sells for $23, so that's a 30 percent discount. It's not the first time we've seen this deal, but it's a pretty decent one all the same. This is arguably one of the more useful AirTag accessories around for certain use cases. It won't exactly be helpful for an AirTag that you put in a wallet or attach to your keys, as it's too bulky for such a purpose — and it doesn't have a hole for a keyring anyway. Still, if you're looking for an AirTag case that you can place in a suitcase or backpack and not have to touch for years, this could be the ticket. Elevation Lab says that, when you place a couple of AA batteries in the case, it can extend the tracker's battery life to as much as 10 years (the brand recommends using Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries for best results). The AirTag is slated to run for over a year on its standard CR2032 button cell. The case gives the AirTag more protection as well. It's sealed with four screws and it has a IP69 waterproof rating. What's more, it doesn't ostensibly look like an AirTag case, so someone who steals an item with one inside is perhaps less likely to realize that the object they pilfered is being tracked. There are some other downsides, though. Since the AirTag is locked inside a case, the sound it emits will be muffled. Elevation Lab says the device's volume will be about two-thirds the level of a case-free AirTag. However, the second-gen AirTag is louder than its predecessor, which should mitigate that issue somewhat.

          "title": "The best record players for 2026",
          "standfirst": "Vinyl records are firmly back in rotation, but getting started does not have to mean spending a fortune or building a complicated hi-fi stack from day one. Whether you want a simple, all-in-one setup with built-in speakers or you are piecing together a more traditional system with a separate amplifier, the best record player is the one that fits how you listen at home. For this guide, we focused on high-quality turntables under $600 that deliver a satisfying listening experience without unnecessary complexity. These picks cover everything from beginner-friendly automatic models to more audiophile-leaning decks that prioritize sound quality and upgrade potential, proving you do not need to jump into the high-end to enjoy vinyl properly. Best record players for 2026 Other record players we tested Audio-Technica AT-LP60XBT This is about as basic as it gets, unless you opt for the AT-LP60X which ditches the Bluetooth connectivity. This is a perfectly decent option for someone just getting into vinyl, but if you spend a little more for the AT-LP70X, you won’t be in quite as big of a hurry to upgrade once you surrender to the obsession. Cambridge Audio Alva ST The Alva ST has a refined design that made me want to keep it out in my living room longer than many of the models on this list. The controls are limited on the top to power and individual options for 33 and 45 RPM speeds. Everything else is on the back panel, including Bluetooth pairing and preamp buttons. To complete the look, Cambridge Audio opted for a 1mm aluminium top plate, which sits on an MDF plinth with a layer of EVA to absorb vibrations in between. While the overall audio performance on the Alva ST is warm and inviting, there is a lack of detail across genres. I’ve noticed albums don’t have a particularly wide soundstage, and songs lack their normal punch at times, so some sound compressed compared to when they’re played on other turntables. Additionally, the free swinging tone arm needs more resistance so it’s not so prone to dropping on a record immediately if it slips out of your fingers when you have the cueing lever down. Since this turntable is fully manual operation, I felt a bit of peril every time I went to lower the needle. (The price increased during testing for this guide.) Denon DP-300F Denon’s DP-300F is a mixed bag. On one hand, you get the convenience of fully automatic operation, dedicated speed and record size buttons and somewhat refined design. There are also some confounding decisions though, like the permanently affixed cables, the preamp switch being under the platter and the overall midrange build quality for a $500 turntable. The sound from the preamp and Denon’s cartridge has a clear lack of depth and detail that almost any model at this price should offer. How to shop for a turntable The first question you’ll need to ask yourself when looking for a turntable is how you plan to use it. Are you into vinyl for the ritual? If you simply like the concept of physical media, having to flip a record to finish it or the need to intentionally swap out an album when it’s done, that’s just fine. You probably can make do with a more affordable turntable since overall sound quality may not be a main concern. If you crave the warmth of analog sound, and you want the collection you’ve invested in to sound its best, you’ll need to consider something with better specs. You’ll also need to account for where and how you’re going to listen to vinyl. Are you planning to connect this turntable to headphones or Bluetooth speakers? Do you have shelf or tower speakers you’re going to use? Are you willing to invest in a dedicated preamp or would you rather a new turntable come with one built in? All of these questions will impact your buying decision — even the Bluetooth codecs, if you’re going the wireless route. Best record players Billy Steele for Engadget Automatic, semi-auto and manual operation If you’re just getting into vinyl, an automatic turntable will save you a lot of stress. These are the models that place the stylus for you — all you have to do is push a button. When you get to the end of the record, the turntable will also return the tonearm to its resting spot automatically. Or, if you need to stop your session mid-side, there’s a button for that too. Some turntables have semi-automatic operation. Maybe they can’t place the needle for you, but they do have an automatic stop when a side of a record is complete. This auto stop, which sometimes comes with an on/off switch, can prevent unnecessary wear on your stylus and vinyl. Plus, many turntables with automatic operation allow you to take control if you need to drop the stylus in a certain place (that’s not the beginning of the record) or if you have a die-cut vinyl (like the It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown soundtrack). Then there’s the fully manual option. Here, you’re solely responsible for placing the tonearm and taking it off when the music stops. A lot of turntables have a cue lever to assist with the process, and a lot of tonearms have a mechanism that lowers them slowly rather than violently dropping them on a record. This adds one more step to the ritual, and it’s one many purists prefer. Preamp The biggest decision you’ll need to make in terms of a preamp is to decide if you want one built into your turntable or if you’d rather use a separate one. It can be very convenient, especially for beginners, to use a built-in component to amplify the signal from the turntable before it hits any speakers or headphones. The downside is that you’re left with what the company provides from the factory, so if you’re looking to upgrade, you’ll have to disable the preamp inside. On most turntables, there’s a switch that allows you to do this, so it’s no trouble. But, opting to skip the preamp on some models could save you money that could be invested elsewhere. A dedicated preamp typically uses higher-quality components and reduces noise by keeping internal parts properly separated. More robust models may even provide controls for things like tone or multiple inputs, while the basic options will simply allow you to plug in, play and forget it. If you’re after the best possible clarity and realism from your record collection, we’d recommend a dedicated preamp right from the start. Best record players Billy Steele for Engadget Removable cartridge/headshell The next item you’ll want to consider is if the turntable you’re eyeing can be upgraded in the future. The best way to do this is by swapping out the cartridge. Most turntables allow you to do this but there are some that don’t, so you’ll need to pay attention to this detail. Upgrading the cartridge down the road is a great way to improve overall sound quality without having to buy a new turntable, new speakers or a new amp. Belt drive vs. direct drive There are two main types of turntables: belt drive and direct drive. All of the models we tested for this guide are belt drive, which means there’s a thin belt that connects the platter to the motor to make the thing spin. Direct drive turntables are widely used by DJs and Technics was the first to make them. Here, the motor is directly under the platter and connected to it directly so the setup is less prone to wearing out. This is especially key when you’re doing things like scratching. Direct-drive turntables tend to be more expensive than their belt-driven counterparts. Counterweight and anti-skate control Most turntables will include a counterweight on the tonearm and some form of anti-skate control. Both of these help keep the stylus in place with the correct amount of pressure, all to ensure proper operation with minimal wear on your records. Sometimes the anti-skate elements are built into the tonearm while other models offer a dedicated dial on the surface of the plinth. The ability to adjust both of these can help you fine-tune the performance of your turntable over time, which may be necessary after upgrading the cartridge or other components. Other components to consider Some final items you’ll want to evaluate on a prospective turntable purchase include the materials used for the base (plinth), platter and even the feet. Cheaper turntables may be mostly plastic affairs while more expensive models can use solid MDF (medium-density fibreboard) for the plinth. A lot of turntables have aluminum platters with a felt pad while others may feature a thick acrylic version. And while entry-level turntables may have small, plastic feet, premium models come with larger, adjustable, rubberized feet for better vibration isolation. While some of these come down to personal preference — a frosted acrylic platter looks really nice — there are some performance boosts to be gained depending on how the company uses the components. How we test turntables Since most turntables under $600 meet the criteria for entry-level through midrange, we tested every model with a set of Audio-Technica AT-SP3X powered speakers. These offer balanced sound for turntables with a 1.1-inch tweeter and 3-inch woofer in each unit. And at $269, they won’t break the bank if you need speakers for your new turntable and they’ll provide ample sound performance even if you spend more than our budget on a new deck. For all of our test units that didn’t have a built-in preamp, we used the Fluance PA-10. At $100, it’s an affordable upgrade if you’re looking to bypass a turntable’s included components or if you’re looking to go more analog with your turntable purchase. There are no buttons or controls, just connect your turntable, speakers and ground wire (if you’re using one) and you’re ready to go. It’s simple, straightforward and inexpensive, so it’s a great option for beginners and more experienced vinyl collectors alike. In terms of performance testing, we play a variety of genres on each turntable to evaluate sound quality. We also carefully examine the overall experience of putting a record on, setting the speed, placing the tonearm and more, which allows us to judge how well each turntable will work for users at different experience levels. Lastly, we take notes on design and components, comparing those elements from each turntable with our other test subjects to make our recommendations.

          "content": "Vinyl records are firmly back in rotation, but getting started does not have to mean spending a fortune or building a complicated hi-fi stack from day one. Whether you want a simple, all-in-one setup with built-in speakers or you are piecing together a more traditional system with a separate amplifier, the best record player is the one that fits how you listen at home. For this guide, we focused on high-quality turntables under $600 that deliver a satisfying listening experience without unnecessary complexity. These picks cover everything from beginner-friendly automatic models to more audiophile-leaning decks that prioritize sound quality and upgrade potential, proving you do not need to jump into the high-end to enjoy vinyl properly. Best record players for 2026 Other record players we tested Audio-Technica AT-LP60XBT This is about as basic as it gets, unless you opt for the AT-LP60X which ditches the Bluetooth connectivity. This is a perfectly decent option for someone just getting into vinyl, but if you spend a little more for the AT-LP70X, you won’t be in quite as big of a hurry to upgrade once you surrender to the obsession. Cambridge Audio Alva ST The Alva ST has a refined design that made me want to keep it out in my living room longer than many of the models on this list. The controls are limited on the top to power and individual options for 33 and 45 RPM speeds. Everything else is on the back panel, including Bluetooth pairing and preamp buttons. To complete the look, Cambridge Audio opted for a 1mm aluminium top plate, which sits on an MDF plinth with a layer of EVA to absorb vibrations in between. While the overall audio performance on the Alva ST is warm and inviting, there is a lack of detail across genres. I’ve noticed albums don’t have a particularly wide soundstage, and songs lack their normal punch at times, so some sound compressed compared to when they’re played on other turntables. Additionally, the free swinging tone arm needs more resistance so it’s not so prone to dropping on a record immediately if it slips out of your fingers when you have the cueing lever down. Since this turntable is fully manual operation, I felt a bit of peril every time I went to lower the needle. (The price increased during testing for this guide.) Denon DP-300F Denon’s DP-300F is a mixed bag. On one hand, you get the convenience of fully automatic operation, dedicated speed and record size buttons and somewhat refined design. There are also some confounding decisions though, like the permanently affixed cables, the preamp switch being under the platter and the overall midrange build quality for a $500 turntable. The sound from the preamp and Denon’s cartridge has a clear lack of depth and detail that almost any model at this price should offer. How to shop for a turntable The first question you’ll need to ask yourself when looking for a turntable is how you plan to use it. Are you into vinyl for the ritual? If you simply like the concept of physical media, having to flip a record to finish it or the need to intentionally swap out an album when it’s done, that’s just fine. You probably can make do with a more affordable turntable since overall sound quality may not be a main concern. If you crave the warmth of analog sound, and you want the collection you’ve invested in to sound its best, you’ll need to consider something with better specs. You’ll also need to account for where and how you’re going to listen to vinyl. Are you planning to connect this turntable to headphones or Bluetooth speakers? Do you have shelf or tower speakers you’re going to use? Are you willing to invest in a dedicated preamp or would you rather a new turntable come with one built in? All of these questions will impact your buying decision — even the Bluetooth codecs, if you’re going the wireless route. Best record players Billy Steele for Engadget Automatic, semi-auto and manual operation If you’re just getting into vinyl, an automatic turntable will save you a lot of stress. These are the models that place the stylus for you — all you have to do is push a button. When you get to the end of the record, the turntable will also return the tonearm to its resting spot automatically. Or, if you need to stop your session mid-side, there’s a button for that too. Some turntables have semi-automatic operation. Maybe they can’t place the needle for you, but they do have an automatic stop when a side of a record is complete. This auto stop, which sometimes comes with an on/off switch, can prevent unnecessary wear on your stylus and vinyl. Plus, many turntables with automatic operation allow you to take control if you need to drop the stylus in a certain place (that’s not the beginning of the record) or if you have a die-cut vinyl (like the It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown soundtrack). Then there’s the fully manual option. Here, you’re solely responsible for placing the tonearm and taking it off when the music stops. A lot of turntables have a cue lever to assist with the process, and a lot of tonearms have a mechanism that lowers them slowly rather than violently dropping them on a record. This adds one more step to the ritual, and it’s one many purists prefer. Preamp The biggest decision you’ll need to make in terms of a preamp is to decide if you want one built into your turntable or if you’d rather use a separate one. It can be very convenient, especially for beginners, to use a built-in component to amplify the signal from the turntable before it hits any speakers or headphones. The downside is that you’re left with what the company provides from the factory, so if you’re looking to upgrade, you’ll have to disable the preamp inside. On most turntables, there’s a switch that allows you to do this, so it’s no trouble. But, opting to skip the preamp on some models could save you money that could be invested elsewhere. A dedicated preamp typically uses higher-quality components and reduces noise by keeping internal parts properly separated. More robust models may even provide controls for things like tone or multiple inputs, while the basic options will simply allow you to plug in, play and forget it. If you’re after the best possible clarity and realism from your record collection, we’d recommend a dedicated preamp right from the start. Best record players Billy Steele for Engadget Removable cartridge/headshell The next item you’ll want to consider is if the turntable you’re eyeing can be upgraded in the future. The best way to do this is by swapping out the cartridge. Most turntables allow you to do this but there are some that don’t, so you’ll need to pay attention to this detail. Upgrading the cartridge down the road is a great way to improve overall sound quality without having to buy a new turntable, new speakers or a new amp. Belt drive vs. direct drive There are two main types of turntables: belt drive and direct drive. All of the models we tested for this guide are belt drive, which means there’s a thin belt that connects the platter to the motor to make the thing spin. Direct drive turntables are widely used by DJs and Technics was the first to make them. Here, the motor is directly under the platter and connected to it directly so the setup is less prone to wearing out. This is especially key when you’re doing things like scratching. Direct-drive turntables tend to be more expensive than their belt-driven counterparts. Counterweight and anti-skate control Most turntables will include a counterweight on the tonearm and some form of anti-skate control. Both of these help keep the stylus in place with the correct amount of pressure, all to ensure proper operation with minimal wear on your records. Sometimes the anti-skate elements are built into the tonearm while other models offer a dedicated dial on the surface of the plinth. The ability to adjust both of these can help you fine-tune the performance of your turntable over time, which may be necessary after upgrading the cartridge or other components. Other components to consider Some final items you’ll want to evaluate on a prospective turntable purchase include the materials used for the base (plinth), platter and even the feet. Cheaper turntables may be mostly plastic affairs while more expensive models can use solid MDF (medium-density fibreboard) for the plinth. A lot of turntables have aluminum platters with a felt pad while others may feature a thick acrylic version. And while entry-level turntables may have small, plastic feet, premium models come with larger, adjustable, rubberized feet for better vibration isolation. While some of these come down to personal preference — a frosted acrylic platter looks really nice — there are some performance boosts to be gained depending on how the company uses the components. How we test turntables Since most turntables under $600 meet the criteria for entry-level through midrange, we tested every model with a set of Audio-Technica AT-SP3X powered speakers. These offer balanced sound for turntables with a 1.1-inch tweeter and 3-inch woofer in each unit. And at $269, they won’t break the bank if you need speakers for your new turntable and they’ll provide ample sound performance even if you spend more than our budget on a new deck. For all of our test units that didn’t have a built-in preamp, we used the Fluance PA-10. At $100, it’s an affordable upgrade if you’re looking to bypass a turntable’s included components or if you’re looking to go more analog with your turntable purchase. There are no buttons or controls, just connect your turntable, speakers and ground wire (if you’re using one) and you’re ready to go. It’s simple, straightforward and inexpensive, so it’s a great option for beginners and more experienced vinyl collectors alike. In terms of performance testing, we play a variety of genres on each turntable to evaluate sound quality. We also carefully examine the overall experience of putting a record on, setting the speed, placing the tonearm and more, which allows us to judge how well each turntable will work for users at different experience levels.

          "standfirst": "As a former Mint user, I had to find a new budgeting app not too long ago. Intuit, parent company of Mint, shut down the service in March 2024, and prompted users to transition to its other financial app, Credit Karma. However, after testing Credit Karma myself, I found it to be a poor Mint replacement — that meant I needed to branch out and look elsewhere for a trusted app to track all of my financial accounts, monitor my credit score, follow a monthly spending plan and set goals like building a rainy-day fund and paying down my mortgage faster.I tried out Mint's top competitors in the hopes that I'd be able to find a new budgeting app that could handle all of my financial needs. Hopefully my journey can help you find the best budgeting app for you and your money as well. Best budget apps of 2026 Other budgeting apps we tested PocketGuard PocketGuard used to be a solid free budget tracker, but the company has since limited its “free” version to just a free seven-day trial. Now, you’ll have to choose between two plans once the trial is over: a $13 monthly plan or a $75 annual plan. When I first tested it, I found it to be more restricted than NerdWallet, but still a decent option. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals. Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and that’s what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income. Although PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate. Ultimately, now that the free tier is gone, it just doesn’t present the same value proposition as it once did. How we test budgeting apps Before I dove in and started testing out budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to try out, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps (or other budgeting methods) they might be using for money management. Some of the apps I found were free and these, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.) All of the services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web. Once I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps, I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable Groundhog Day of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once. Budgeting app FAQs What is Plaid and how does it work? Each of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, the company claims. To be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including all of the budgeting apps listed in this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well. As the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices. In a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.” Why did Mint shut down? When parent company Intuit announced in December 2023 that it would shut down Mint, it did not provide a reason why it made the decision to do so. It did say that Mint's millions of users would be funneled over to its other finance app, Credit Karma. \"Credit Karma is thrilled to invite all Minters to continue their financial journey on Credit Karma, where they will have access to Credit Karma’s suite of features, products, tools and services, including some of Mint’s most popular features,\" Mint wrote on its product blog. In our testing, we found that Credit Karma isn't an exact replacement for Mint — so if you're still looking for a Mint alternative, you have some decent options. What about Rocket Money? Rocket Money is another free financial app that tracks spending and supports things like balance alerts and account linking. If you pay for the premium tier, the service can also help you cancel unwanted subscriptions. We did not test it for this guide, but we'll consider it in future updates.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html?src=rss",

          "title": "z.ai's open source GLM-5 achieves record low hallucination rate and leverages new RL 'slime' technique",
          "standfirst": "Chinese AI startup Zhupai aka z.ai is back this week with an eye-popping new frontier large language model: GLM-5.The latest in z.ai&#x27;s ongoing and continually impressive GLM series, it retains an open source MIT License — perfect for enterprise deployment – and, in one of several notable achievements, achieves a record-low hallucination rate on the independent Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index v4.0. With a score of -1 on the AA-Omniscience Index—representing a massive 35-point improvement over its predecessor—GLM-5 now leads the entire AI industry, including U.S. competitors like Google, OpenAI and Anthropic, in knowledge reliability by knowing when to abstain rather than fabricate information.Beyond its reasoning prowess, GLM-5 is built for high-utility knowledge work. It features native \"Agent Mode\" capabilities that allow it to turn raw prompts or source materials directly into professional office documents, including ready-to-use .docx, .pdf, and .xlsx files. Whether generating detailed financial reports, high school sponsorship proposals, or complex spreadsheets, GLM-5 delivers results in real-world formats that integrate directly into enterprise workflows.It is also disruptively priced at roughly $0.80 per million input tokens and $2.56 per million output tokens, approximately 6x cheaper than proprietary competitors like Claude Opus 4.6, making state-of-the-art agentic engineering more cost-effective than ever before. Here&#x27;s what else enterprise decision makers should know about the model and its training. Technology: scaling for agentic efficiencyAt the heart of GLM-5 is a massive leap in raw parameters. The model scales from the 355B parameters of GLM-4.5 to a staggering 744B parameters, with 40B active per token in its Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This growth is supported by an increase in pre-training data to 28.5T tokens.To address training inefficiencies at this magnitude, Zai developed \"slime,\" a novel asynchronous reinforcement learning (RL) infrastructure. Traditional RL often suffers from \"long-tail\" bottlenecks; Slime breaks this lockstep by allowing trajectories to be generated independently, enabling the fine-grained iterations necessary for complex agentic behavior. By integrating system-level optimizations like Active Partial Rollouts (APRIL), slime addresses the generation bottlenecks that typically consume over 90% of RL training time, significantly accelerating the iteration cycle for complex agentic tasks.The framework’s design is centered on a tripartite modular system: a high-performance training module powered by Megatron-LM, a rollout module utilizing SGLang and custom routers for high-throughput data generation, and a centralized Data Buffer that manages prompt initialization and rollout storage. By enabling adaptive verifiable environments and multi-turn compilation feedback loops, slime provides the robust, high-throughput foundation required to transition AI from simple chat interactions toward rigorous, long-horizon systems engineering.To keep deployment manageable, GLM-5 integrates DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), preserving a 200K context capacity while drastically reducing costs.End-to-end knowledge workZai is framing GLM-5 as an \"office\" tool for the AGI era. While previous models focused on snippets, GLM-5 is built to deliver ready-to-use documents. It can autonomously transform prompts into formatted .docx, .pdf, and .xlsx files—ranging from financial reports to sponsorship proposals. In practice, this means the model can decompose high-level goals into actionable subtasks and perform \"Agentic Engineering,\" where humans define quality gates while the AI handles execution.High performance GLM-5’s benchmarks make it the new most powerful open source model in the world, according to Artificial Analysis, surpassing Chinese rival Moonshot&#x27;s new Kimi K2.5 released just two weeks ago, showing that Chinese AI companies are nearly caught up with far better resourced proprietary Western rivals. According to z.ai&#x27;s own materials shared today, GLM-5 ranks near state-of-the-art on several key benchmarks:SWE-bench Verified: GLM-5 achieved a score of 77.8, outperforming Gemini 3 Pro (76.2) and approaching Claude Opus 4.6 (80.9).Vending Bench 2: In a simulation of running a business, GLM-5 ranked #1 among open-source models with a final balance of $4,432.12.Beyond performance, GLM-5 is aggressively undercutting the market. Live on OpenRouter as of February 11, 2026, it is priced at approximately $0.80–$1.00 per million input tokens and $2.56–$3.20 per million output tokens. It falls in the mid-range compared to other leading LLMs, but based on its top-tier bechmarking performance, it&#x27;s what one might call a \"steal.\"ModelInput (per 1M tokens)Output (per 1M tokens)Total Cost (1M in + 1M out) SourceQwen 3 Turbo$0.05$0.20$0.25Alibaba CloudGrok 4.1 Fast (reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIGrok 4.1 Fast (non-reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIdeepseek-chat (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekdeepseek-reasoner (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekGemini 3 Flash Preview$0.50$3.00$3.50GoogleKimi-k2.5$0.60$3.00$3.60MoonshotGLM-5$1.00$3.20$4.20Z.aiERNIE 5.0$0.85$3.40$4.25QianfanClaude Haiku 4.5$1.00$5.00$6.00AnthropicQwen3-Max (2026-01-23)$1.20$6.00$7.20Alibaba CloudGemini 3 Pro (≤200K)$2.00$12.00$14.00GoogleGPT-5.2$1.75$14.00$15.75OpenAIClaude Sonnet 4.5$3.00$15.00$18.00AnthropicGemini 3 Pro (>200K)$4.00$18.00$22.00GoogleClaude Opus 4.6$5.00$25.00$30.00AnthropicGPT-5.2 Pro$21.00$168.00$189.00OpenAIThis is roughly 6x cheaper on input and nearly 10x cheaper on output than Claude Opus 4.6 ($5/$25). This release confirms rumors that Zhipu AI was behind \"Pony Alpha,\" a stealth model that previously crushed coding benchmarks on OpenRouter.However, despite the high benchmarks and low cost, not all early users are enthusiastic about the model, noting its high performance doesn&#x27;t tell the whole story. Lukas Petersson, co-founder of the safety-focused autonomous AI protocol startup Andon Labs, remarked on X: \"After hours of reading GLM-5 traces: an incredibly effective model, but far less situationally aware. Achieves goals via aggressive tactics but doesn&#x27;t reason about its situation or leverage experience. This is scary. This is how you get a paperclip maximizer.\"The \"paperclip maximizer\" refers to a hypothetical situation described by Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom back in 2003, in which an AI or other autonomous creation accidentally leads to an apocalyptic scenario or human extinction by following a seemingly benign instruction — like maximizing the number of paperclips produced — to an extreme degree, redirecting all resources necessary for human (or other life) or otherwise making life impossible through its commitment to fulfilling the seemingly benign objective. Should your enterprise adopt GLM-5?Enterprises seeking to escape vendor lock-in will find GLM-5’s MIT License and open-weights availability a significant strategic advantage. Unlike closed-source competitors that keep intelligence behind proprietary walls, GLM-5 allows organizations to host their own frontier-level intelligence.Adoption is not without friction.

          "content": "Chinese AI startup Zhupai aka z.ai is back this week with an eye-popping new frontier large language model: GLM-5.The latest in z.ai&#x27;s ongoing and continually impressive GLM series, it retains an open source MIT License — perfect for enterprise deployment – and, in one of several notable achievements, achieves a record-low hallucination rate on the independent Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index v4.0. With a score of -1 on the AA-Omniscience Index—representing a massive 35-point improvement over its predecessor—GLM-5 now leads the entire AI industry, including U.S. competitors like Google, OpenAI and Anthropic, in knowledge reliability by knowing when to abstain rather than fabricate information.Beyond its reasoning prowess, GLM-5 is built for high-utility knowledge work. It features native \"Agent Mode\" capabilities that allow it to turn raw prompts or source materials directly into professional office documents, including ready-to-use .docx, .pdf, and .xlsx files. Whether generating detailed financial reports, high school sponsorship proposals, or complex spreadsheets, GLM-5 delivers results in real-world formats that integrate directly into enterprise workflows.It is also disruptively priced at roughly $0.80 per million input tokens and $2.56 per million output tokens, approximately 6x cheaper than proprietary competitors like Claude Opus 4.6, making state-of-the-art agentic engineering more cost-effective than ever before. Here&#x27;s what else enterprise decision makers should know about the model and its training. Technology: scaling for agentic efficiencyAt the heart of GLM-5 is a massive leap in raw parameters. The model scales from the 355B parameters of GLM-4.5 to a staggering 744B parameters, with 40B active per token in its Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This growth is supported by an increase in pre-training data to 28.5T tokens.To address training inefficiencies at this magnitude, Zai developed \"slime,\" a novel asynchronous reinforcement learning (RL) infrastructure. Traditional RL often suffers from \"long-tail\" bottlenecks; Slime breaks this lockstep by allowing trajectories to be generated independently, enabling the fine-grained iterations necessary for complex agentic behavior. By integrating system-level optimizations like Active Partial Rollouts (APRIL), slime addresses the generation bottlenecks that typically consume over 90% of RL training time, significantly accelerating the iteration cycle for complex agentic tasks.The framework’s design is centered on a tripartite modular system: a high-performance training module powered by Megatron-LM, a rollout module utilizing SGLang and custom routers for high-throughput data generation, and a centralized Data Buffer that manages prompt initialization and rollout storage. By enabling adaptive verifiable environments and multi-turn compilation feedback loops, slime provides the robust, high-throughput foundation required to transition AI from simple chat interactions toward rigorous, long-horizon systems engineering.To keep deployment manageable, GLM-5 integrates DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), preserving a 200K context capacity while drastically reducing costs.End-to-end knowledge workZai is framing GLM-5 as an \"office\" tool for the AGI era. While previous models focused on snippets, GLM-5 is built to deliver ready-to-use documents. It can autonomously transform prompts into formatted .docx, .pdf, and .xlsx files—ranging from financial reports to sponsorship proposals. In practice, this means the model can decompose high-level goals into actionable subtasks and perform \"Agentic Engineering,\" where humans define quality gates while the AI handles execution.High performance GLM-5’s benchmarks make it the new most powerful open source model in the world, according to Artificial Analysis, surpassing Chinese rival Moonshot&#x27;s new Kimi K2.5 released just two weeks ago, showing that Chinese AI companies are nearly caught up with far better resourced proprietary Western rivals. According to z.ai&#x27;s own materials shared today, GLM-5 ranks near state-of-the-art on several key benchmarks:SWE-bench Verified: GLM-5 achieved a score of 77.8, outperforming Gemini 3 Pro (76.2) and approaching Claude Opus 4.6 (80.9).Vending Bench 2: In a simulation of running a business, GLM-5 ranked #1 among open-source models with a final balance of $4,432.12.Beyond performance, GLM-5 is aggressively undercutting the market. Live on OpenRouter as of February 11, 2026, it is priced at approximately $0.80–$1.00 per million input tokens and $2.56–$3.20 per million output tokens. It falls in the mid-range compared to other leading LLMs, but based on its top-tier bechmarking performance, it&#x27;s what one might call a \"steal.\"ModelInput (per 1M tokens)Output (per 1M tokens)Total Cost (1M in + 1M out) SourceQwen 3 Turbo$0.05$0.20$0.25Alibaba CloudGrok 4.1 Fast (reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIGrok 4.1 Fast (non-reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIdeepseek-chat (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekdeepseek-reasoner (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekGemini 3 Flash Preview$0.50$3.00$3.50GoogleKimi-k2.5$0.60$3.00$3.60MoonshotGLM-5$1.00$3.20$4.20Z.aiERNIE 5.0$0.85$3.40$4.25QianfanClaude Haiku 4.5$1.00$5.00$6.00AnthropicQwen3-Max (2026-01-23)$1.20$6.00$7.20Alibaba CloudGemini 3 Pro (≤200K)$2.00$12.00$14.00GoogleGPT-5.2$1.75$14.00$15.75OpenAIClaude Sonnet 4.5$3.00$15.00$18.00AnthropicGemini 3 Pro (>200K)$4.00$18.00$22.00GoogleClaude Opus 4.6$5.00$25.00$30.00AnthropicGPT-5.2 Pro$21.00$168.00$189.00OpenAIThis is roughly 6x cheaper on input and nearly 10x cheaper on output than Claude Opus 4.6 ($5/$25). This release confirms rumors that Zhipu AI was behind \"Pony Alpha,\" a stealth model that previously crushed coding benchmarks on OpenRouter.However, despite the high benchmarks and low cost, not all early users are enthusiastic about the model, noting its high performance doesn&#x27;t tell the whole story. Lukas Petersson, co-founder of the safety-focused autonomous AI protocol startup Andon Labs, remarked on X: \"After hours of reading GLM-5 traces: an incredibly effective model, but far less situationally aware. Achieves goals via aggressive tactics but doesn&#x27;t reason about its situation or leverage experience. This is scary. This is how you get a paperclip maximizer.\"The \"paperclip maximizer\" refers to a hypothetical situation described by Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom back in 2003, in which an AI or other autonomous creation accidentally leads to an apocalyptic scenario or human extinction by following a seemingly benign instruction — like maximizing the number of paperclips produced — to an extreme degree, redirecting all resources necessary for human (or other life) or otherwise making life impossible through its commitment to fulfilling the seemingly benign objective. Should your enterprise adopt GLM-5?Enterprises seeking to escape vendor lock-in will find GLM-5’s MIT License and open-weights availability a significant strategic advantage.

          "title": "Anthropic’s Claude Cowork finally lands on Windows — and it wants to automate your workday",
          "standfirst": "Anthropic released its Claude Cowork AI agent software for Windows on Monday, bringing the file management and task automation tool to roughly 70 percent of the desktop computing market and intensifying a remarkable corporate realignment that has seen Microsoft embrace a direct competitor to its longtime AI partner, OpenAI.The Windows launch arrives with what Anthropic calls \"full feature parity\" with the macOS version: file access, multi-step task execution, plugins, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) connectors for integrating external services. Users can now also set global and folder-specific instructions that Claude follows in every session, a feature developers on Reddit described as \"a game-changer\" for maintaining context across projects.\"Cowork is now available on Windows,\" Anthropic announced on X. \"We&#x27;re bringing full feature parity with MacOS: file access, multi-step task execution, plugins, and MCP connectors.\"The release closes a critical platform gap that had limited Cowork to Apple&#x27;s operating system since its January 12 debut. The Windows expansion underscores a broader transformation already underway in enterprise AI, with Microsoft simultaneously selling its own GitHub Copilot to customers while encouraging thousands of its own employees to adopt Anthropic&#x27;s competing tools internally.Inside Microsoft&#x27;s surprising pivot toward its biggest AI rivalThe relationship between Microsoft and Anthropic has accelerated with striking speed. In November, the two companies announced a strategic partnership allowing Microsoft Foundry customers access to Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Claude Haiku 4.5. As part of that arrangement, Anthropic committed to purchasing $30 billion of Azure compute capacity.But the partnership has expanded well beyond cloud hosting. According to a January 22 report in The Verge, Microsoft has begun encouraging thousands of employees from some of its most prolific teams to adopt Claude Code — and now, by extension, Cowork — even if they have no coding experience.Microsoft&#x27;s CoreAI team, the new AI engineering group led by former Meta engineering chief Jay Parikh, has tested Claude Code in recent months, The Verge reported. The company has also approved Claude Code across all code and repositories for its Business and Industry Copilot teams.\"Software engineers at Microsoft are now expected to use both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot and give feedback comparing the two,\" The Verge reported.The company&#x27;s spending on Anthropic approaches $500 million annually, according to The Information. Microsoft has even begun counting Anthropic AI model sales toward Azure sales quotas — an unusual incentive structure that the company typically reserves for homegrown products or models from OpenAI.A $13 billion partnership faces new questions as Microsoft hedges its betsMicrosoft&#x27;s embrace of Anthropic raises uncomfortable questions about its $13 billion investment in OpenAI, which has long served as the exclusive provider of frontier AI models for Microsoft&#x27;s products. The two companies signed their landmark partnership in 2019, with Microsoft providing Azure computing infrastructure in exchange for preferential access to OpenAI&#x27;s technology.That relationship now appears to be evolving into something more nuanced. Microsoft has started favoring Anthropic&#x27;s Claude models inside Microsoft 365 apps and Copilot recently, deploying them in specific applications or features where Anthropic&#x27;s models have proven more capable than OpenAI&#x27;s counterparts.On February 5, Microsoft announced that Claude Opus 4.6 — Anthropic&#x27;s most advanced model — would become available in Microsoft Foundry, the company&#x27;s enterprise AI platform. The Azure blog post framed the integration as bringing \"even more capability to agents that increasingly learn from and act on business systems.\"\"At Microsoft we believe that intelligence and trust are the core requirements of agentic AI at scale,\" the announcement stated. \"Built on Azure, Microsoft Foundry brings these capabilities together on a secure, scalable cloud foundation for enterprise AI.\"The timing and tone suggest Microsoft views Anthropic not merely as a hedging strategy but as a genuine technical leader in certain domains. Claude Opus 4.6 offers a one-million-token context window and 128,000-token maximum output — specifications that position it for complex, long-running enterprise tasks that require processing vast amounts of information.Why a $285 billion stock selloff has the software industry questioning its futureThe deepening Microsoft-Anthropic alliance takes on added significance when viewed against a backdrop of genuine alarm rippling through the software industry. Within days of the macOS launch in January, investors began repricing SaaS companies whose products overlap with Cowork&#x27;s capabilities — project management tools, writing assistants, data analysis platforms, and workflow automation software all saw sharp declines.Bloomberg reported that Cowork triggered a $285 billion software stocks selloff. The carnage reflected growing investor conviction that AI agents capable of automating knowledge work could render entire categories of enterprise software obsolete.The fear is not abstract. Cowork operates as a desktop agent powered by Claude Opus 4.6 that can read local files, execute multi-step tasks, and interact with external services through plugins — all running directly on a user&#x27;s machine. Unlike chatbot interfaces that respond to individual prompts, Cowork plans and executes complete workflows across files, applications, and connected services.Anthropic has leaned into this positioning. On January 30, the company&#x27;s Anthropic Labs division released 11 open-source agentic plugins spanning sales, legal, finance, marketing, data analysis, and software development. These plugins connect Cowork to external tools, enabling the agent to pull data from CRMs, draft legal documents, analyze spreadsheets, or manage project boards without users switching applications.The hidden risks of giving an AI agent access to your filesSuch convenience comes with tradeoffs, and Anthropic has been transparent about the risks inherent in agent software that can read, write, and delete files. The company&#x27;s support documentation warns users to \"be cautious about granting access to sensitive information like financial documents, credentials, or personal records\" and suggests saving backups and creating dedicated folders with nonsensitive information.Cowork remains susceptible to prompt injection attacks — hidden instructions embedded in documents or websites that can hijack AI agents and redirect their actions. The browser automation feature includes an explicit disclaimer warning that hidden code in websites may \"steal your data, inject malware into your systems, or take over your system.\"\"We use a virtual machine under the hood,\" Boris Cherny, Anthropic&#x27;s head of Claude Code, told Wired. \"This means you have to say which folders Claude has access to. And if you don&#x27;t give it access to a folder, Claude literally cannot see that folder.\"The Windows version includes additional safety constraints. According to user reports on Reddit, Cowork on Windows restricts file access to the user&#x27;s personal folder, preventing the agent from accessing common development directories like C:\\git. While some users expressed frustration at this limitation, others noted it as a prudent safeguard for less technical users.\"To be fair, seeing how many people nuked themselves with Claude Code, it is much safer to limit people to reduce the collateral damage,\" wrote one Reddit user.Major corporations are already betting on Claude&#x27;s enterprise potentialDespite the security caveats, early enterprise adoption suggests meaningful interest. Customer testimonials published alongside the Claude Opus 4.6 announcement on the Microsoft Azure blog included statements from Adobe, Dentons, and other major organizations already integrating Anthropic&#x27;s technology into their workflows.\"At Adobe, we&#x27;re continuously evaluating new AI capabilities that can help us deliver more powerful, responsible, and intuitive experiences for our customers,\" said Michael Marth, VP Engineering for Experience Manager and LLM Optimizer. \"Foundry gives us a flexible, enterprise-ready environment to explore frontier models while maintaining the trust, governance, and scale that are critical for Adobe.\"Matej Jambrich, CTO of Dentons Europe, described deploying Claude for legal work: \"Better model reasoning reduces rework and improves consistency, so our lawyers can focus on higher value judgment.\"On Reddit, an Anthropic representative wrote that the Windows release addresses \"the most consistent request\" since Cowork&#x27;s macOS debut — a demand that came \"especially from enterprise teams.\" The detail underscores the tool&#x27;s perceived value in corporate environments where Windows dominates the desktop landscape.At $20 a month, Cowork positions itself as a premium productivity playAccess to these capabilities comes at a price. Cowork for Windows is available in research preview at claude.com/cowork for all paid Claude subscription tiers, including Pro ($20/month), Max ($100/month), Team, and Enterprise. Free-tier users cannot access the feature.This pricing structure positions Cowork as a premium productivity tool rather than a mass-market offering — at least for now. Anthropic has not announced plans for broader availability, and the \"research preview\" designation suggests the company continues to gather user feedback before committing to a general release.The January macOS launch was similarly restricted to $100/month Max subscribers before expanding to other paid tiers, suggesting Anthropic may follow a gradual rollout strategy as it refines the product. For enterprise customers evaluating the tool, the pricing represents a fraction of what many pay for traditional software licenses—a calculus that could accelerate adoption if Cowork delivers on its automation promises.The battle for the future of work has a new front lineFor Microsoft, the deepening Anthropic partnership reflects a pragmatic recognition that AI leadership may require embracing multiple frontier providers rather than relying exclusively on a single partner.The company&#x27;s willingness to deploy Claude tools internally while selling GitHub Copilot externally suggests confidence that the enterprise market can accommodate competing approaches — or perhaps an acknowledgment that betting everything on OpenAI carries its own risks.For the broader software industry, Cowork&#x27;s expansion to Windows extends the competitive threat to an even larger installed base. Companies whose value propositions rest on task automation, file management, or workflow orchestration now face a well-funded competitor capable of replicating their core functionality through natural language commands.The $285 billion in market capitalization that evaporated after Cowork&#x27;s January launch may prove to be just an opening salvo. With Windows support now live, Anthropic has removed the last major platform barrier between its AI agent and the enterprise customers most likely to adopt it.The software industry spent decades building tools to help knowledge workers manage files, automate tasks, and organize information. Now it faces a future where a single application, powered by an AI that learns and improves with every interaction, threatens to do all of that and more. The question is no longer whether AI agents will reshape enterprise software, but how much of the old world will survive the transformation.",

For enterprise customers evaluating the tool, the pricing represents a fraction of what many pay for traditional software licenses—a calculus that could accelerate adoption if Cowork delivers on its automation promises.The battle for the future of work has a new front lineFor Microsoft, the deepening Anthropic partnership reflects a pragmatic recognition that AI leadership may require embracing multiple frontier providers rather than relying exclusively on a single partner.The company&#x27;s willingness to deploy Claude tools internally while selling GitHub Copilot externally suggests confidence that the enterprise market can accommodate competing approaches — or perhaps an acknowledgment that betting everything on OpenAI carries its own risks.For the broader software industry, Cowork&#x27;s expansion to Windows extends the competitive threat to an even larger installed base. Companies whose value propositions rest on task automation, file management, or workflow orchestration now face a well-funded competitor capable of replicating their core functionality through natural language commands.The $285 billion in market capitalization that evaporated after Cowork&#x27;s January launch may prove to be just an opening salvo. With Windows support now live, Anthropic has removed the last major platform barrier between its AI agent and the enterprise customers most likely to adopt it.The software industry spent decades building tools to help knowledge workers manage files, automate tasks, and organize information. Now it faces a future where a single application, powered by an AI that learns and improves with every interaction, threatens to do all of that and more. The question is no longer whether AI agents will reshape enterprise software, but how much of the old world will survive the transformation.",

For the Complete tier, the deal brings the total cost down to $130 for 24 months. NordVPN regularly appears on Engadget’s list of the best VPN services thanks to its wide server network, strong security tools and consistent performance across devices. NordVPN’s latest promotion puts one of its most comprehensive plans at a price that undercuts many competing premium VPN subscriptions. The Complete tier includes full access to NordVPN’s core VPN service, which encrypts internet traffic and masks a user’s IP address to help protect online activity on public Wi-Fi networks and at home. Subscribers can use the service on multiple devices, including phones, tablets, laptops and smart TVs, with apps available for major operating systems. It also includes access to NordPass (more on that below), an ad blocker and 1TB of cloud storage. You’ll find similar discounts on all of NordVPN’s other plans: Basic, Plus and Prime. Beyond the basics, NordVPN offers features like threat protection to help block malicious websites and trackers, as well as specialty servers designed for added privacy or faster performance in specific scenarios. In our NordVPN review, the service was praised for its evolving feature set and overall reliability, even as the VPN market becomes increasingly competitive. Engadget regularly tracks VPN pricing trends and this offer compares favorably with other current promotions. It also appears alongside NordVPN deals featured in Engadget’s ongoing roundup of the best VPN discounts available right now, which compares offers from multiple major providers. Those looking for additional security tools may also want to note that NordVPN’s Complete plan bundles in extra services beyond the VPN itself. One of those is NordPass, the company’s password management app. NordPass is also discounted as part of a separate promotion, if you’re primarily looking for a password manager rather than a VPN. The Premium tier is currently 50 percent off, bringing the price down to $36 for two years. NordPass Premium adds features such as cross-device password syncing, secure password sharing and breach monitoring, which alerts users if stored credentials appear in known data leaks. Both offers are available for a limited time, though Nord has not specified an end date for the promotion. If you’re still unsure whether NordVPN is right for you, it offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can change your mind and get a full refund.

For any use case, you can bet at least two providers will be neck-and-neck for first place. On the other hand, the VPN world is still the Wild West in some ways.

Windscribe Windscribe is another well-known free VPN supported by paid subscriptions. In many ways, it takes the best from both Mullvad and Proton VPN, with the former's no-nonsense privacy and the latter's healthy free plan. Without paying, you can connect to 10 of Windscribe's server locations on an unlimited number of devices at once. We've just published a full Windscribe review that can tell you more. Unfortunately, Windscribe didn't copy the most important part of Proton VPN's free plan — the unlimited data. You're only allowed to use 10GB per month, which isn't enough for regular streaming. It's also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways. Private Internet Access Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) has a deeply annoying name — I assume whoever invented it also likes to hop in their Toyota Forward Motion to grab a gallon of Sustaining Cow Extract from the grocery store — but it's a worthwhile VPN whose pricing provides incredible value. Its monthly and yearly plans are good enough, but its three-year plan is the clincher. Not only is it longer than average, but you can continue to renew at the three-year level, so you won't see an unpleasant price jump the first time you re-up. PIA's apps have a dark UI reminiscent of Proton VPN, which is always a good thing. It also supports port forwarding, custom DNS and the use of a SOCKS5 or Shadowsocks proxy as a second step in the VPN connection. You can even set the maximum data packet size to help out a struggling connection, as I cover in my full PIA VPN review. The downside is that your connection will struggle a lot. While well-designed, PIA's apps have a tendency to lag. In my most recent battery of tests, it dragged oddly on my internet in ways that weren't directly reflected in the speed tests. It's also not always capable of unblocking streaming services in other countries, and while its server network offers 152 IP address options in 84 countries, it's heavily bulked out by virtual locations. TunnelBear TunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it's far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month. VyprVPN VyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn't crack the VPN encryption itself). It's also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks. Despite all that, it didn't make the top seven because its connection speeds aren't up to scratch — you'll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits. Norton VPN Norton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It's a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix. This isn't to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won't find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts. What to look for in a VPN Choosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We're here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below. For more advice and dangers to look for, check out my article on how to tell if your VPN is working. Compatibility: First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren't always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need. Speed: Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use Ookla's speedtest.net). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it's actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it's using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content. Background: Do some outside research into the VPN's origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It's a dealbreaker if you can't figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit. Server network: Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you'll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada. Customer Service: I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it's available at convenient times in your timezone. Pricing: Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you're comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals. VPN FAQs To wrap up, let's answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don't cover here. What is a VPN? VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, including corporate VPNs like Cisco AnyConnect, Perimeter81 and NordLayer, which are used to access a single network securely. For this list, though, we're talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity. Whenever you get online, you're assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it's possible to create a record of what an individual does online. When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN's servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won't trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN's IP address, not yours. If you're interested in more detail, I've written a whole article on how a VPN works. What are some things VPNs are used for? The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online. One side effect of borrowing a VPN's IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online. Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as certain US states or countries — like the UK — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn't blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN's homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn't mean that authorities can't detect that it's being used in a given location. Are VPNs worth it? Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It's no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world. With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries. What information does a VPN hide? A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship. However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there's nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you're using a VPN. A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can't do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that's concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up. Are VPNs safe? As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there's very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before. All that said, there are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, and others that pretend to be independent services while all secretly working off the same backend. Always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it. Can you get a VPN on your phone? Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you're free to choose whichever provider you like. What about Google's One VPN? Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you're a Google Fi subscriber. That said, I don't recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn't trust it to guard your sensitive information.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss",

It's also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways. Private Internet Access Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) has a deeply annoying name — I assume whoever invented it also likes to hop in their Toyota Forward Motion to grab a gallon of Sustaining Cow Extract from the grocery store — but it's a worthwhile VPN whose pricing provides incredible value. Its monthly and yearly plans are good enough, but its three-year plan is the clincher. Not only is it longer than average, but you can continue to renew at the three-year level, so you won't see an unpleasant price jump the first time you re-up. PIA's apps have a dark UI reminiscent of Proton VPN, which is always a good thing. It also supports port forwarding, custom DNS and the use of a SOCKS5 or Shadowsocks proxy as a second step in the VPN connection. You can even set the maximum data packet size to help out a struggling connection, as I cover in my full PIA VPN review. The downside is that your connection will struggle a lot. While well-designed, PIA's apps have a tendency to lag. In my most recent battery of tests, it dragged oddly on my internet in ways that weren't directly reflected in the speed tests. It's also not always capable of unblocking streaming services in other countries, and while its server network offers 152 IP address options in 84 countries, it's heavily bulked out by virtual locations. TunnelBear TunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it's far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month. VyprVPN VyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn't crack the VPN encryption itself). It's also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks. Despite all that, it didn't make the top seven because its connection speeds aren't up to scratch — you'll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits. Norton VPN Norton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It's a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix. This isn't to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won't find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts. What to look for in a VPN Choosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We're here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below. For more advice and dangers to look for, check out my article on how to tell if your VPN is working. Compatibility: First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren't always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need. Speed: Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use Ookla's speedtest.net). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it's actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it's using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content. Background: Do some outside research into the VPN's origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It's a dealbreaker if you can't figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit. Server network: Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you'll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada. Customer Service: I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it's available at convenient times in your timezone. Pricing: Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you're comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals. VPN FAQs To wrap up, let's answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don't cover here. What is a VPN? VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, including corporate VPNs like Cisco AnyConnect, Perimeter81 and NordLayer, which are used to access a single network securely. For this list, though, we're talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity. Whenever you get online, you're assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it's possible to create a record of what an individual does online. When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN's servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won't trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN's IP address, not yours. If you're interested in more detail, I've written a whole article on how a VPN works. What are some things VPNs are used for? The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online. One side effect of borrowing a VPN's IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online. Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as certain US states or countries — like the UK — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn't blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN's homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn't mean that authorities can't detect that it's being used in a given location. Are VPNs worth it? Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It's no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world. With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries. What information does a VPN hide? A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship. However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there's nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you're using a VPN. A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can't do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that's concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up. Are VPNs safe? As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there's very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before. All that said, there are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, and others that pretend to be independent services while all secretly working off the same backend. Always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it. Can you get a VPN on your phone? Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you're free to choose whichever provider you like. What about Google's One VPN? Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you're a Google Fi subscriber. That said, I don't recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn't trust it to guard your sensitive information.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss",

Right now you can pick up a four-pack of Apple’s diminutive first-generation Bluetooth trackers for $64, which translates to 35 percent off and a near record low price. Bear in mind that this deal brings the price per AirTag down to about $16 if you were to buy them individually, and when not on sale they usually cost $29. If you use Apple devices and consider yourself to be a serial thing-misplacer, AirTags are extremely useful. Adding one to your account takes a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network so well established, locating missing items has never been easier. Using your iPhone you can trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively Precision Finding can be used to pinpoint its location via Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone, paying attention to the vibrations that signal you’re getting closer. A reminder again that the above deals apply to the first-generation AirTag only. Apple introduced a refreshed tracker with greater range and a louder speaker last month, which retails at the same price as its predecessor. For deals on the new AirTag, you may have to wait a bit.

          "standfirst": "Whether it's the Seahawks' commanding Super Bowl victory or the fast-paced action of the Milan Winter Olympics, there's a lot of sportsball happening right now. It's a great time to get ahold of a virtual private network (VPN) and enjoy worldwide streaming adventures while improving your cybersecurity. By connecting to a VPN every time you get online, you can keep your activity hidden from your ISP and anyone to whom it may sell that data — while streaming sporting events and TV dramas from across the globe. We strongly recommend using a VPN, but shopping for one takes some care. If you jump on the very first deal you see, you might get stuck with a substandard app. It's also easy to end up paying more than you meant to, since otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be. Even with all those conditions, there are some great bargains on the table. Many of the best VPNs — including our top pick, Proton VPN — have deals that save you anywhere from 70 to 87 percent on annual subscriptions. If you can believe it, there are even Valentine's Day sales running right now, because nothing is more romantic than taking care of your online privacy. Best VPN deals ExpressVPN Basic — $68.40 for a two-year subscription with four months free (81 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This discount, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 81 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price. ExpressVPN Advanced — $88.00 for a two-year subscription with four months free (77 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. As above, note that it renews at $119.95 annually. NordVPN Basic — $81.36 for a two-year subscription (70 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. NordVPN includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This deal gives you 70 percent off the two-year plan, but note that it renews at $139.08 per year. NordVPN Plus — $93.36 for a two-year subscription (74 percent off): NordVPN has taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. When this plan renews, you'll be paying $179.88 per year. Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark One — $61.83 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with four months free (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 28 months of CyberGhost for 79 percent off the usual price, but it'll renew at $56.94 per year. hide.me — $69.99 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. It also comes with a guarantee that it'll renew at exactly the same length and pricing. Windscribe — $69 for a one-year subscription (32 percent off): It's not nearly as steep a discount as some of the others on this list, but Windscribe was cheap to begin with, so 32 percent off its monthly price is a bigger savings than it might seem. As I just covered in a detailed Windscribe review, it's worth upgrading from the free service to get full access to Windscribe's all-real server network (and remove the free plan's data cap). Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. You can also get a shorter one-year subscription for $40 ($3.33 per month). Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. What makes a good VPN deal Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

The memo reportedly included a detailed explanation of why the review should proceed. The Wall Street Journal confirmed the report with its own sources, who added that FDA scientists attended an hourlong meeting with Prasad in early January, in which they laid out their objections to Prasad's plans to block the vaccine review.

Now he's starring in Spider-Noir, a new live-action series based on the Marvel Comics character. Cage plays an aging private investigator and disillusioned superhero in 1930s New York. Prime Video released the first teaser in two forms: one in black and white—very Raymond Chandler-esque—and another in color, which the showrunners are calling \"True Hue.\" Marvel Comics created its \"noir\" line in 2009, reinterpreting familiar Marvel characters in an alternate universe, usually set during the Great Depression in the US. A version of the Spider-Noir character, voiced by Cage, briefly appeared in the animated masterpieces, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) and Across the Spider-Verse (2023). (He is set to reprise that role in the upcoming Beyond the Spider-Verse.) Co-showrunner (with Steve Lightfoot) Oren Uziel is a film noir fan, so that Marvel series naturally appealed to him. The live-action series is still set in 1930s New York, but the spidery superhero is not Peter Parker. (Uziel thought the Parker character was too associated with a boyish high school type, which didn't really fit the noir vibe.) So Cage is playing Ben Reilly, a hard-boiled PI with a secret superhero identity, The Spider. Cage has described his portrayal as \"70 percent Humphrey Bogart [specifically The Big Sleep] and 30 percent Bugs Bunny,\" which seems pretty on point for Cage's distinctively flamboyant style.Read full article Comments",

Seconds later, the rocket twisted on its axis before recovering and continuing the climb into orbit with a batch of US military satellites. The sight may have appeared familiar to seasoned rocket watchers. Sixteen months ago, a Vulcan rocket lost one of its booster nozzles shortly after launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The rocket recovered from the malfunction and still reached the mission's planned orbit. Details of Thursday's booster problem remain unclear. An investigation into the matter is underway, according to ULA, a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. But the circumstances resemble those of the booster malfunction in October 2024. Closeup video from Thursday's launch shows a fiery plume near the throat of one of the rocket's four solid-fueled boosters, the area where the motor's propellant casing connects to its bell-shaped exhaust nozzle. The throat drives super-hot gas from the burning solid propellant through the nozzle to generate thrust.Read full article Comments",

It's not just a port of the iPad app, either—it has panels arranged spatially in front of the user as you'd expect, and it supports 3D videos, as well as 360- and 180-degree ones. YouTube's App Store listing says users can watch \"every video on YouTube\" (there's a screenshot of a special interface for Shorts vertical videos, for example) and that they get \"the full signed-in experience\" with watch history and so on.Read full article Comments",

Framework, the company behind repairable and upgradeable computer designs like the Laptop 13, Laptop 16, and Laptop 12, is also taking a hard hit by price increases. The company stopped selling standalone RAM sticks in November 2025 and has increased prices on one or more of its systems every month since then; this week's increases are hitting the Framework Desktop and the DIY Editions of its various laptops particularly hard. The price increases are affecting both standalone SODIMM memory modules and the soldered-down LPDDR5X memory used in the Framework Desktop. Patel says that standalone RAM sticks are being priced \"as close as we can to the weighted average cost of our purchases from suppliers.\" In September, buying an 8GB stick of RAM with a Framework Laptop 13 cost $40; it currently costs $130. A 96GB DDR5 kit of two 48GB sticks costs $1,340, up from $480 in September.Read full article Comments",

One adversarial session reportedly prompted the model more than 100,000 times across various non-English languages, collecting responses ostensibly to train a cheaper copycat. Google published the findings in what amounts to a quarterly self-assessment of threats to its own products that frames the company as the victim and the hero, which is not unusual in these self-authored assessments. Google calls the illicit activity \"model extraction\" and considers it intellectual property theft, which is a somewhat loaded position, given that Google's LLM was built from materials scraped from the Internet without permission. Google is also no stranger to the copycat practice. In 2023, The Information reported that Google's Bard team had been accused of using ChatGPT outputs from ShareGPT, a public site where users share chatbot conversations, to help train its own chatbot. Senior Google AI researcher Jacob Devlin, who created the influential BERT language model, warned leadership that this violated OpenAI's terms of service, then resigned and joined OpenAI. Google denied the claim but reportedly stopped using the data.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Years before the Chevrolet Bolt or Tesla Model 3, the Nissan Leaf was a good-faith attempt by a major automaker to bring electric vehicles to the mass market. But even in its second-generation, the Leaf was hamstrung by poor battery management and was soon left behind. For its third take on the Leaf, Nissan fixed the earlier cars' key flaw by adding liquid-cooling for the battery pack. Better yet, the new Leaf is built on a dedicated EV platform that offers better interior space and range efficiency than the hatchback it replaces, despite taking up less road space. Our first drive of the car took place last year in San Diego, a region where the roads tend to flatter a car. Our first impression was positive enough to place the Leaf first among the cars we drove in 2025. Sure, if money were no object, I'd take that hybrid Porsche 911 that came in second, but you could buy five fully loaded Leafs for the same price as a bare-bones Carrera GTS. And for those of us in the real world, money usually is an object. But a longer test with the Leaf was in order to see how the electric Nissan held up in the day-to-day grind. Price and specs In time, Nissan will offer an entry-level Leaf with a 52 kWh battery pack and a bit less power. For now, though, the company is only importing cars with a 75 kWh (usable) pack and a 214 hp (160 kW), 262 lb-ft (355 Nm) electric motor, which drives the front wheels. Nissan has managed to keep the price sensible, too; the S+ trim starts at $29,990. Riding on the smallest 18-inch wheels, the S+ has the longest range at 303 miles (488 km), but this version does without some of the features many EV drivers may consider essential, like heated front seats and a heat pump.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Very few people alive today have seen the Appalachian forests as they existed a century ago. Even as state and national parks preserved ever more of the ecosystem, fungal pathogens from Asia nearly wiped out one of the dominant species of these forests, the American chestnut, killing an estimated 3 billion trees. While new saplings continue to sprout from the stumps of the former trees, the fungus persists, killing them before they can seed a new generation. But thanks in part to trees planted in areas where the two fungi don't grow well, the American chestnut isn't extinct. And efforts to revive it in its native range have continued, despite the long generation times needed to breed resistant trees. In Thursday's issue of Science, researchers describe their efforts to apply modern genomic techniques and exhaustive testing to identify the best route to restoring chestnuts to their native range. Multiple paths to restoration While the American chestnut is functionally extinct—it's no longer a participant in the ecosystems it once dominated—it's most certainly not extinct. Two Asian fungi that have killed it off in its native range; one causes chestnut blight, while a less common pathogen causes a root rot disease. Both prefer warmer, humid environments and persist there because they can grow asymptomatically on distantly related trees, such as oaks. Still, chestnuts planted outside the species' original range—primarily in drier areas of western North America—have continued to thrive.Read full article Comments",

That's because the trunk is highly sensitive when it comes to sensing touch. Scientists have determined that the whiskers lining the trunk are crucial for that sensitivity thanks to their unique structure, amounting to a kind of innate \"material intelligence, according to a new paper published in the journal Science. As previously reported, there is a long history of studying whiskers (vibrissae) in mammals. Rats, cats, tree squirrels, manatees, harbor seals, sea otters, pole cats, shrews, tammar wallabies, sea lions, and naked mole-rats all share strikingly similar basic whisker anatomies, according to various prior studies. Among other potential applications, such research could one day enable scientists to build artificial whiskers as tactile sensors in robotics, as well as learn more about human touch. Whiskers are much more complex than one might think, both in structure and function. Rats, for instance, have about 30 large whiskers and dozens of smaller ones, part of a complex “scanning sensorimotor system” that enables the rat to perform such diverse tasks as texture analysis, active touch for path finding, pattern recognition, and object location, just by scanning the terrain with its whiskers.Read full article Comments",

NASA used the site to launch Saturn V rockets dispatching astronauts to the Moon, then converted the pad for the Space Shuttle program. The last shuttle flight lifted off from Pad 39A in 2011, and the agency leased the site to SpaceX for use as the departure point for the company's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. SpaceX started launching from Pad 39A in 2017, then installed a new Crew Access Arm on the pad's tower the following year, replacing the aging shuttle-era arm that connected to the hatches of NASA's orbiters. SpaceX added the new arm ahead of the first test flight of the company's human-rated Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2019.

          "content": "It's not every day that a classic PC game gets a new content expansion 25 years after its last major update. But that's what happened last night, as Blizzard suddenly released new \"Reign of the Warlock\" DLC that adds a new class, new end-game challenges, and new inventory-management options to the classic Diablo II. To be clear, the new DLC is technically not for the original 2000 release of Diablo II (which was still getting patches as of 2016) but for the game's 2021 Resurrected remaster. Still, that remastered version has gameplay and animations that are extremely faithful to the original, making yesterday's surprise update the kind of content drop that players have been waiting for since 2001's \"Lord of Destruction\" expansion. The \"Reign of the Warlock\" DLC lets you \"command forbidden power\" as a new class that \"wields forbidden arts, bridles hellfire and shadow, and dominates demons,\" according to the in-game class selection screen description. By way of backstory, Blizzard writes that most Warlocks \"have the means to lead a lavish lifestyle but find the pursuit of luxury and ease stale. Instead, they leverage their elevated status in Sanctuary to hunt down lost knowledge that would enable them to continue the legacy of Horazon.\"Read full article Comments",

Unfortunately, AI agents are still rough around the edges, so tasking them with anything important is not a great idea. OpenAI launched its Atlas agent late last year, which we found to be modestly useful, and now it's Google's turn. Unlike the OpenAI agent, Google's new Auto Browse agent has extraordinary reach because it's part of Chrome, the world's most popular browser by a wide margin. Google began rolling out Auto Browse (in preview) earlier this month to AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers, allowing them to send the agent across the web to complete tasks. I've taken Chrome's agent for a spin to see whether you can trust it to handle tedious online work for you. For each test, I lay out the problem I need to solve, how I prompted the robot, and how well (or not) it handled the job.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "On Wednesday, a fossil-fuel lobbying group called the Washington Coal Club awarded President Trump a trophy that named him the \"Undisputed Champion of Clean, Beautiful Coal.\" Trump took advantage of the opportunity to take his latest shot at reviving the fortunes of the US's most polluting source of electricity: an executive order that would make the military buy it. Coal is the second most expensive source of power for the US grid, eclipsed by gas, wind, solar, hydro—everything other than nuclear power. It also produces the most pollution, including particulates that damage human lungs, chemicals that contribute to acid rain, and coal ash that contains many toxic metals. It also emits the most carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced. Prior to Trump's return to office, the US grid had been rapidly moving away from its use, including during his first term. Despite the long-standing Republican claims to support free markets, the second Trump administration has determined that the only way to keep coal viable is direct government intervention. Its initial attempts involved declaring an energy emergency and then using that to justify forcing coal plants slated for closure to continue operations. The emergency declaration relied on what appears to be a tenuous interpretation of the Federal Power Act, and the administration was already facing a lawsuit challenging these actions.Read full article Comments",
