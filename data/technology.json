Apple’s new hypertension notifications use data from the watches’ existing optical heart sensor to “analyze how a user’s blood vessels respond to the beats of the heart.” An algorithm will then review this data over a period of 30 days and will notify users if it detects signs of high blood pressure. Apple says it expects clearance from the FDA and other regulators this month. It will roll out in more than 150 countries and regions. Additionally, Apple’s upcoming Sleep Score feature is coming to a wider selection of watches beyond the new Watch Series 11. Next week, it will roll out to the Watch Series 6 and later, in addition to all Watch Ultra models and the second-gen Watch SE and later. This feature uses your heart rate, wrist temperature, blood oxygen, and respiratory data to rate the quality of your sleep when used with an iPhone 11 or later.

          "content": "Apple's most famous chips are the A- and M-series processors that power its iPhones, iPads, and Macs, but this year, its effort to build its own wireless chips is starting to bear fruit. Earlier this spring, the iPhone 16e included Apple's C1 modem, furthering Apple's ambitions to shed its dependence on Qualcomm, and today's iPhone Air brought a faster Apple C1X variant, plus something new: the Apple N1, a chip that provides Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread support for all of today's new iPhones. Apple didn't dive deep into the capabilities of the N1, or why it had switched from using third-party suppliers (historically, Apple has mostly leaned on Broadcom for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth). However, the company's press releases say that it should make Continuity features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop more reliable—these features use Bluetooth for initial communication and then Wi-Fi to establish a high-speed local link between two devices. Other features that use a similar combination of wireless technologies, like using an iPad as an extended Mac display, should also benefit. These aren't Apple's first chips to integrate Wi-Fi or Bluetooth technology. The Apple Watches rely on W-series chips to provide their Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity; the Apple H1 and H2 chips also provide Bluetooth connectivity for many of Apple's wireless headphones. But this is the first time that Apple has switched to its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip in one of its iPhones, suggesting that the chips have matured enough to provide higher connectivity speeds for more demanding devices.Read full article Comments",

Reports of subreddits suddenly having inaccurate summaries when viewed on Reddit’s Android app started surfacing on Reddit a couple of weeks ago. On August 29, a moderator reported on the r/ModSupport subreddit for moderators that the r/ThronesAndDominions subreddit's description changed from “The wayward adventures of Dylan Carlson and the band Earth” to “The crazy adventures of Dylan Carlson and the band Earth.” The problem got more attention when r/actuallesbians’ Android app description described the community as “a place for straight and transgender lesbians …” instead of “a place for cis and trans lesbians …” Other complaints followed, including from r/autisticparents, a subreddit for parents with autism whose description was changed to say that it is a group for “parents of autistic children.” A moderator who asked to be referred to by their Reddit username, Paige_Railstone, described the confusion that the changes brought to their subreddit:Read full article Comments",

It shifted to \"basically the same phone in two sizes\" a decade or so ago, and then to a version of \"one lineup of regular phones and one lineup of Pro phones\" in 2017 when the iPhone 8 was introduced next to the iPhone X. But thanks to Apple's newly introduced iPhone Air, the iPhone 17 lineup gives new phone buyers more choices and trade-offs than they've ever had before. Apple's phones are now available in a spectrum of sizes, weights, speeds, costs, and camera configurations. And while options are great to have, it also means you need to know more about which one to pick. We've gone hands-on with all four of Apple's new phones, and while more extensive tire-kicking will be required, we can at least try to nail down exactly what kind of person each of these phones is for.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "On Tuesday, Anthropic launched a new file creation feature for its Claude AI assistant that enables users to generate Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, and other documents directly within conversations on the web interface and in the Claude desktop app. While the feature may be handy for Claude users, the company's support documentation also warns that it \"may put your data at risk\" and details how the AI assistant can be manipulated to transmit user data to external servers. The feature, awkwardly named \"Upgraded file creation and analysis,\" is basically Anthropic's version of ChatGPT's Code Interpreter and an upgraded version of Anthropic's \"analysis\" tool. It's currently available as a preview for Max, Team, and Enterprise plan users, with Pro users scheduled to receive access \"in the coming weeks,\" according to the announcement. The security issue comes from the fact that the new feature gives Claude access to a sandbox computing environment, which enables it to download packages and run code to create files. \"This feature gives Claude Internet access to create and analyze files, which may put your data at risk,\" Anthropic writes in its blog announcement. \"Monitor chats closely when using this feature.\"Read full article Comments",

The positive results come as Americans face a confusing, state-by-state patchwork of access to the shots under the health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an ardent anti-vaccine activist who has unilaterally restricted access. Prior to the second Trump administration, all Americans ages 6 months and older had access to the vaccines. But under Kennedy, the Food and Drug Administration limited COVID-19 vaccine approvals to people 65 and older, and people under 64 years only if they have an underlying medical condition. In Pfizer and BioNTech's latest trial, the companies limited enrollment to these groups. The phase 3 trial included 100 people total, 50 people aged 65 or older and 50 people aged 18 to 64 with an underlying condition. Those conditions included asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, HIV, mental health conditions, Parkinson's disease, obesity, or smoking. All participants had gotten last season's COVID shot at least six months prior to the trial and had not gotten any other COVID-19 vaccines or a COVID-19 infection since then.Read full article Comments",

Additionally, the launch target has slipped from the year 2026 to 2028. However, the cost increase and schedule slippages are not new. The space agency disclosed these issues nearly a year and a half ago.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-42944, makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute commands by submitting malicious payloads to an open port. The maximum-severity threat stems from a deserialization vulnerability. Serialization is a coding process that translates data structures and object states into formats that can be stored or transmitted and then reconstructed later. Deserialization is the process in reverse.Read full article Comments",

The headliner across all of the updates is Apple’s new “Liquid Glass” UI overhaul, which adds glass-inspired transparency and translucency and bouncy animations throughout all of Apple’s software.

Additionally, Apple claims that voices will sound \"more natural\" in Transparency, the mode meant to allow nearby sounds to be heard even while you have the earbuds in.

The new designs have a new aluminum unibody enclosure, with a glass cutout on the back to allow for wireless charging and a huge new camera bump that Apple calls the \"camera plateau,\" stretching all the way across the back.Read full article Comments",

The UK's Department for Business and Trade recently released evaluation results from its Microsoft 365 Copilot trial showing that while overall satisfaction was 72 percent, neurodiverse employees reported statistically higher satisfaction (at a 90 percent confidence level) and were more likely to recommend the tool (at a 95 percent confidence level) than other respondents. \"It's leveled the playing field,\" one participant with ADHD told researchers during follow-up interviews. One user with dyslexia said that the tool \"empowered\" them to perform tasks with confidence they previously lacked, particularly in report writing. Another dyslexic participant drew direct comparisons to existing accessibility software, noting that Copilot \"does a hell of a lot more\" than traditional assistive technology while being \"embedded in your applications\" rather than requiring separate programs.Read full article Comments",

Pre-orders start Friday, and the phones will be available on September 19. The updated OLED screen is the hero of the iPhone 17, bringing several features to the base iPhone that the iPhone Pro has enjoyed for years. The iPhone 17 steps up from a 6.1-inch to a 6.3-inch display, the same increase that came to the iPhone 16 Pro last year, and Apple has also added 120 Hz ProMotion support to the basic iPhone for the first time. A 6.3-inch 120 Hz screen is the headlining feature of the new iPhone. Credit: Apple The iPhone 17 is powered by the Apple A19 chip. Credit: Apple The refresh rate adjusts dynamically based on what you're doing, and can go as low as 1 Hz in the low-power always-on display mode. Apple has also improved the scratch-resistance of the display with Ceramic Shield 2, which the company says is three times as scratch-resistant as the old screen. The screen can also hit 3,000 nits of peak outdoor brightness.Read full article Comments",

Instead, critics fear Anthropic will get off cheaply, striking a deal with authors suing that covers less than 500,000 works and paying a small fraction of its total valuation (currently $183 billion) to get away with the massive theft. Defector noted that the settlement doesn't even require Anthropic to admit wrongdoing, while the company continues raising billions based on models trained on authors' works.

Nintendo's lawsuit alleged that the company initially approached Daly about the sale of these devices in March 2024, and that Daly agreed at the time \"both verbally and in signed writing\" to refrain from further sales. After Daly continued to sell the devices, though, Nintendo took the further step of bringing this lawsuit last June.Read full article Comments",
