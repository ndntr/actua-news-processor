          "standfirst": "In a major milestone for the \"AI coding wars,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman confirmed on X that the company&#x27;s standalone Codex application (currently only for Mac computers) surpassed 1 million downloads in its first week of availability, echoing the explosive growth of OpenAI&#x27;s hit chatbot ChatGPT after it first launched in late 2022.The surge reflects a 60% week-over-week growth in overall Codex users, following the February 2 launch of the app and the subsequent release of the underlying GPT-5.3-Codex model.While OpenAI is currently celebrating this rapid adoption, the company is signaling that the era of unlimited free access to its most powerful agentic tools is transitioning toward a more restricted model.The agentic coding command centerUnlike traditional auto-complete plugins, the Codex app is positioned as a \"command center\" for agentic coding. It utilizes GPT-5.3-Codex, a model OpenAI describes as its most capable agentic model to date. Notably, Altman claimed that the model was instrumental in its own creation, with early versions used to debug the very training runs that produced the final release.The app&#x27;s primary innovation is its ability to orchestrate multiple AI agents simultaneously. According to OpenAI&#x27;s release notes, the app allows users to:Run Parallel Worktrees: Deploy independent agents to explore different code paths simultaneously without branch conflicts.Delegate Long-Running Tasks: Offload routine maintenance, such as dependency updates and test runs, to background automations.Supervise Coordinated Teams: Move between agents in a unified desktop interface while maintaining full context of a complex project.Limits coming to low-cost and free usersThe 1 million download milestone was catalyzed by OpenAI’s decision to offer Codex access to ChatGPT Free and \"Go\" tier users for a limited promotional period. However, Altman has warned that this high-compute \"free lunch\" is not permanent.\"We’ll keep Codex available to Free/Go users after this promotion; we may have to reduce limits there but we want everyone to be able to try Codex and start building,\" Altman shared on X.This shift aligns with OpenAI&#x27;s broader strategy to manage the immense costs of its \"High capability\" models and applications.While paid OpenAI ChatGPT subscribers (Plus, Pro, Team, and Enterprise) currently enjoy doubled rate limits, the $8/month \"Go\" tier and Free tiers are likely to see stricter throttling as the promotion ends.The AI coding wars are in full swingOpenAI’s push comes as competitors gain significant ground. Anthropic’s Claude Code recently reported reaching $1 billion in annualized revenue within six months of launch.Simultaneously, the \"vibe coding\" movement has seen the rise of model-agnostic tools like Kilo CLI 1.0. Backed by GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij, Kilo unveiled a rebuilt interface on February 4 that supports over 500 models, including rivals like Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen and Google Gemini. Kilo&#x27;s strategy of \"Agentic Anywhere\"—shipping code via terminal, Slack, or IDE—contrasts with the ecosystem-locked nature of OpenAI&#x27;s Codex app.For enterprise decision-makers, especially AI engineers and orchestrators, the rapid-fire releases of GPT-5.3-Codex and Kilo CLI 1.0 signal a transition from AI as a \"copilot\" to AI as an \"operator.\" What 1 million downloads means for enterprise decision-makersThe milestone of 1 million downloads for the Codex app is not merely a figure of consumer interest; it is a validation of the demand for agentic systems that can autonomously manage debugging, deployment, and cross-platform orchestration. To move forward confidently, leaders must shift their focus from single-shot prompts to the management of agentic workflows, ensuring these tools are integrated into governed repositories and that their \"self-improving\" cycles are subjected to rigorous human-in-the-loop oversight.To ensure business success in this evolving landscape, decision-makers should adopt a platform-agnostic and governance-first strategy.While the raw power of GPT-5.3-Codex is undeniable—demonstrated by its record 77.3% result on the Terminal-Bench 2.0 benchmark measuring agentic performance in the terminal environment, according to OpenAI —the rise of open-source, model-flexible alternatives like Kilo CLI suggests that maintaining optionality is critical to avoiding vendor lock-in and opaque subscription costs.

Its two-year plans are up to 81 percent off right now: the Advanced tier is on sale for $88 for two years, plus four additional free months. The Basic plan is where you'll see the biggest discount: it's $68 for two years, plus the same four additional free months. We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it's our current pick for best premium VPN. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue. In our review we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100. The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager.

          "standfirst": "NordVPN is having a big sale on its two-year plans right now. The Complete tier, for example is 70 percent off, bringing the price of 24 months down to just $130. NordVPN regularly appears on Engadget’s list of the best VPN services thanks to its wide server network, strong security tools and consistent performance across devices. NordVPN’s latest promotion puts one of its most comprehensive plans at a price that undercuts many competing premium VPN subscriptions. The Complete tier includes full access to NordVPN’s core VPN service, which encrypts internet traffic and masks a user’s IP address to help protect online activity on public Wi-Fi networks and at home. Subscribers can use the service on multiple devices, including phones, tablets, laptops and smart TVs, with apps available for major operating systems. It also includes access to NordPass (more on that below), an ad blocker and 1TB of cloud storage. You’ll find similar discounts on all of NordVPN’s other plans: Basic, Plus and Prime. Beyond the basics, NordVPN offers features like threat protection to help block malicious websites and trackers, as well as specialty servers designed for added privacy or faster performance in specific scenarios. In our NordVPN review, the service was praised for its evolving feature set and overall reliability, even as the VPN market becomes increasingly competitive. Engadget regularly tracks VPN pricing trends and this offer compares favorably with other current promotions. It also appears alongside NordVPN deals featured in Engadget’s ongoing roundup of the best VPN discounts available right now, which compares offers from multiple major providers. Those looking for additional security tools may also want to note that NordVPN’s Complete plan bundles in extra services beyond the VPN itself. One of those is NordPass, the company’s password management app. NordPass is also discounted as part of a separate promotion, if you’re primarily looking for a password manager rather than a VPN. The Premium tier is currently 50 percent off, bringing the price down to $36 for two years. NordPass Premium adds features such as cross-device password syncing, secure password sharing and breach monitoring, which alerts users if stored credentials appear in known data leaks. Both offers are available for a limited time, though Nord has not specified an end date for the promotion. If you’re still unsure whether NordVPN is right for you, it offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can change your mind and get a full refund.

          "title": "What AI builders can learn from fraud models that run in 300 milliseconds",
          "standfirst": "Fraud protection is a race against scale. For instance, Mastercard’s network processes roughly 160 billion transactions a year, and experiences surges of 70,000 transactions a second during peak periods (like the December holiday rush). Finding the fraudulent purchases among those — without chasing false alarms — is an incredible task, which is why fraudsters have been able to game the system. But now, sophisticated AI models can probe down to individual transactions, pinpointing the ones that seem suspicious — in milliseconds’ time. This is the heart of Mastercard’s flagship fraud platform, Decision Intelligence Pro (DI Pro). “DI Pro is specifically looking at each transaction and the risk associated with it,” Johan Gerber, Mastercard’s EVP of security solutions, said in a recent VB Beyond the Pilot podcast. “The fundamental problem we&#x27;re trying to solve here is assessing in real time.”How DI Pro worksMastercard’s DI Pro was built for latency and speed. From the moment a consumer taps a card or clicks “buy,” that transaction flows through Mastercard’s orchestration layer, back onto the network, and then on to the issuing bank. Typically, this occurs in less than 300 milliseconds. Ultimately, the bank makes the approve-or-decline decision, but the quality of that decision depends on Mastercard’s ability to deliver a precise, contextualized risk score based on whether the transaction could be fraudulent. Complicating this whole process is the fact that they’re not looking for anomalies, per se; they’re looking for transactions that, by design, are similar to consumer behavior. At the core of DI Pro is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that Mastercard refers to as an \"inverse recommender\" architecture. This treats fraud detection as a recommendation problem; the RNN performs a pattern completion exercise to identify how merchants relate to one another. As Gerber explained: “Here&#x27;s where they&#x27;ve been before, here&#x27;s where they are right now. Does this make sense for them? Would we have recommended this merchant to them?” Chris Merz, SVP of data science at MasterCard, explained that the fraud problem can be broken down into two sub components: A user’s pattern behavior and a fraudster’s pattern behavior. “And we&#x27;re trying to tease those two things out,” he said. Another “neat technique,” he said, is how Mastercard approaches data sovereignty, or when data is subject to the laws and governance structures in the region where it is collected, processed, or stored. To keep data “on soil,” the company’s fraud team relies on aggregated, “completely anonymized” data that is not sensitive to any privacy concerns and thus can be shared with models globally. “So you still can have the global patterns influencing every local decision,” said Gerber. “We take a year&#x27;s worth of knowledge and squeeze it into a single transaction in 50 milliseconds to say yes or no, this is good or this is bad.”Scamming the scammersWhile AI is helping financial companies like Mastercard, it’s helping fraudsters, too; now, they’re able to rapidly develop new techniques and identify new avenues to exploit. Mastercard is fighting back by engaging cyber criminals on their turf. One way they’re doing so is by using \"honeypots,\" or artificial environments meant to essentially \"trap\" cyber criminals. When threat actors think they’ve got a legitimate mark, AI agents engage with them in the hopes of accessing mule accounts used to funnel money. That becomes “extremely powerful,” Gerber said, because defenders can apply graph techniques to determine how and where mule accounts are connected to legitimate accounts. Because in the end, to get their payout, scammers need a legitimate account somewhere, linked to mule accounts, even if it’s cloaked 10 layers down. When defenders can identify these, they can map global fraud networks.“It’s a wonderful thing when we take the fight to them, because they cause us enough pain as it is,” Gerber said. Listen to the podcast to learn more about: How Mastercard created a \"malware sandbox\" with Recorded Future; Why a data science engineering requirements document (DSERD) was essential to align four separate engineering teams;The importance of \"relentless prioritization\" and tough decision-making to move beyond \"a thousand flowers blooming\" to projects that actually have a strong business impact;Why successful AI deployment should incorporate three phases: ideation, activation, and implementation — but many enterprises skip the second step.

          "standfirst": "Most microSD cards are fast enough for boosting storage space and making simple file transfers, but some provide a little more value than others. If you’ve got a device that still accepts microSD cards — whether it’s an older gaming handheld, the new Nintendo Switch 2, a dash cam, a drone or an Android tablet — we’ve scoured the market and put close to 20 top contenders through a number of benchmark tests. You can find our recommendations for the best microSD cards below, alongside some general shopping advice worth knowing before you buy. Best microSD cards of 2026 Best microSD Express cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 Jeff Dunn for Engadget Read our full guide to the best microSD Express cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 Let’s be clear about this: Unless you plan to own a Nintendo Switch 2 in the near future, you do not need a high-speed microSD Express card just yet. Nintendo’s gaming handheld is the only popular device that natively supports this standard right now, and microSD Express cards themselves are highly expensive compared to more traditional options. Still, if you do want to increase a Switch 2’s storage, they’re your only choice. Fortunately, determining exactly which model to buy for the console is pretty straightforward: Get whichever one you can find in stock, in the capacity you want, at a price you can stomach. We benchmarked several microSD Express cards for a separate Switch 2 guide, and for the most part, the performance differences between them weren’t great enough to justify paying extra for any particular model. Loading times weren’t quite identical with every test we ran, but the cards were extremely close in most games and common scenarios. The few times when there was a notable gap — fast-traveling to a particularly resource-heavy region in Cyberpunk 2077, for instance — the gulf between the slowest and fastest card was only ever about four or five seconds at most. That’s not nothing, but it’s also not something most people are likely to fret over unless they have a stopwatch handy. The SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro. Jeff Dunn for Engadget The only time you’d notice a major speed difference is if you transfer games to your Express card from the Switch 2’s internal storage (and vice versa). In that case, the SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro were generally the quickest, while PNY’s microSD Express Flash Memory Card had particularly slow write speeds. Moving Mario Kart World to the SanDisk and Lexar models, for example, took around four minutes and 35 seconds on average; with the PNY card, it took a little over seven minutes. That said, the PNY model was the fastest when it came to moving games back to the system storage. Walmart’s Onn microSD Express Card was significantly slower to move games from the card to system storage, but it’s also the most affordable card we’ve seen by a good distance. Either way, most people aren’t constantly shuffling their games back and forth like this. Performance in actual games is more important, and in that regard the results were consistently much tighter. What matters most is getting the most space for your budget. Unfortunately, stock for all microSD Express cards has been spotty since the Switch 2’s launch. For your convenience, we’ll list out all of the models we’ve tested thus far and their respective list prices below. Note that some lower-capacity versions — the 128GB SanDisk card, for one — advertise slower speeds than their more spacious counterparts. SanDisk microSD Express Card: 128GB ($64), 256GB ($78), 512GB ($128) Lexar Play Pro: 256GB ($60), 512GB ($120), 1TB ($220) PNY microSD Express Flash Memory Card: 128GB ($48), 256GB ($62), 512GB ($124) Samsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2: 256GB ($60) Samsung P9 Express: 256GB ($55), 512GB ($100) GameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2: 256GB ($60), 512GB ($100), 1TB ($190) Walmart Onn microSDXC Express Card: 256GB ($47), 512GB ($85) The Lexar Play Pro on top of Lexar's RW540 microSD Express card reader. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Broadly speaking, we recommend getting at least 256GB of storage, as Switch 2 games tend to have much larger file sizes than games for Nintendo’s previous handheld. But we also recommend holding off upgrading for as long as you can, if only because all of these cards should (tariff shenanigans aside) come down in price as time goes on. There’s no point in buying a microSD Express card for anything besides the Switch 2, but we did run the models above through our usual PC benchmarks as well. Unsurprisingly, they are miles faster than any traditional card on the market. With the 256GB SanDisk card, for instance, sequential read speeds checked in just under 900 MB/s in CrystalDiskMark and ATTO, while sequential writes topped out around 650 MB/s. Sustained writes speeds were slower (around 210 MB/s), but that was still fast enough to move our 12GB test file to the card in 52 seconds on average. It took a mere 20 seconds to read the file back to our PC. The write test with our smaller 1.15GB test folder, meanwhile, averaged just 4.5 seconds. It all adds up to performance that's at least twice as fast as the best UHS-I models we’ve tested in terms of sequential reads and writes, with three or four times the speeds in some cases. The gulf in random reads and writes is similar, and in some benchmarks even greater. But you need a pricey SD card reader to even see those increases on a PC, so only those with a Switch 2 in hand or serious cash to burn should consider one of these things. Other notable microSD cards Samsung Pro Ultimate The Samsung Pro Ultimate was the closest competitor to the Lexar Professional Silver Plus across our benchmark tests, but it's tangibly worse in terms of sequential write speeds, typically costs more and doesn’t offer a 1TB option. The Samsung Pro Plus is a bit slower for sequential reads, but it’s close enough otherwise and usually easier to find at a lower price. Lexar Professional Gold We haven't used it ourselves, but if you’re willing to pay for a more powerful UHS-II card built for heavy-duty video recording, the Lexar Professional Gold has tested well elsewhere and should deliver significantly faster sequential write speeds than our UHS-I picks above. It’s one of the few UHS-II cards we could actually find in stock, but it’s pricey, with a 128GB model normally priced in the $35 to $40 range. SanDisk Extreme The SanDisk Extreme effectively matched the Pro Plus in a few of our sequential tests, but that was partly due to us only being able to secure the 256GB model, which is higher-rated than the 128GB version. It’s a fine choice if you see it on sale at a reputable seller, but it’s broadly slower than our top pick and often costs more. SanDisk GamePlay The SanDisk GamePlay performs similarly to the SanDisk Extreme but costs a good bit extra as of our latest update. We couldn’t get it to reach its advertised speeds with the company’s own “Pro” card reader or other third-party options, so it fell short of our top picks. SanDisk Pokémon The SanDisk Pokémon does outperform its advertised read and write speeds, but not by enough to outpace the Lexar Silver Plus or Samsung Pro Plus. It essentially charges extra for having a picture of Pikachu (or Gengar, or Snorlax) on a product you’ll never look at. SanDisk Extreme Pro The SanDisk Extreme Pro is a close analog to the Samsung Pro Ultimate but, as of this writing, is either unavailable at most trusted retailers or priced too high by comparison. The Lexar Professional Silver Plus has faster sequential write speeds as well. PNY XLR8 Gaming The PNY XLR8 is an affordable card that comes with up to 512GB of space. Its sequential and random writes speeds checked in a little bit above those of Samsung’s Evo Select, plus it comes with a lifetime warranty. But its sequential reads were much, much slower, putting it out of contention. PNY Elite-X The PNY Elite-X often goes for cheap and wasn’t too far off the random read/write performance of Samsung's Pro Plus in CrystalDiskMark. Like the XLR8, it’s also slightly above the Evo Select in write speeds. But its sequential reads were too far behind all of our top picks, and it no longer appears to be available in capacities above 256GB. What to look for in a microSD card Capacity The first thing to figure out when buying a microSD card is how much storage space you need. Modern cards are commonly available in sizes ranging from 32GB to 512GB, with several models now available in 1TB or 1.5TB capacities as well. The first 2TB cards from major brands have started to arrive as well, which is exciting, but those are still fairly rare (and very expensive) by comparison. For many, a 128GB or 256GB model should be a sweet spot between price and storage space. But if you need more room — say, for stashing a bunch of games on a Steam Deck — a 512GB card or greater could make more sense and often provides a better cost-per-GB ratio. Pricing and stock levels are all over the place as of our most recent update thanks to ongoing AI-driven shortages, but you can typically still find a decent 128GB card for around $15, a good 256GB card for less than $30 and a solid 512GB card for around $40 (with faster models priced a little higher). There’s a starker increase when you go up to 1TB cards, which often cost closer to $100, though we’ve seen some fall into the $70 to $80 range over the last year. The first 2TB cards are a bigger leap: the 2TB SanDisk Extreme, for example, currently has a list price around $290, which is way up from what we saw in 2025. Note that a microSD card’s performance may differ depending on what capacity you buy. SanDisk says its 128GB Extreme card delivers sequential write speeds up to 90 MB/s, for example, while the higher-capacity models in the same line offer up to 130 MB/s. When we talk about microSD cards today, we mostly refer to cards that use the microSDXC (eXtended Capacity) standard, which have a capacity between 32GB and 2TB. Your device needs to support this for it to work with a microSDXC card. This will almost never be an issue these days, but some older devices (a Nintendo 3DS, for instance) are only compatible with microSDHC (High Capacity) cards, which range from 2GB to 32GB. Read and write speeds MicroSD cards are primarily judged on their read and write speeds, which are usually measured in megabytes per second (MB/s). Generally, most microSD cards have faster read speeds than write speeds. These metrics can then be broken down into sequential and random performance. Sequential read and write speeds matter when you’re trying to access (read) or save (write) long, constant streams of data, such as opening a large video or copying a big batch of files from a PC. If you want to use a microSD card for media storage, this is particularly important. Random performance, meanwhile, is about how quickly a card can read and write small files scattered throughout the device. Since random read/write speeds are much lower than sequential ones, storage device makers tend not to advertise them as loudly. But they’re important if you use a card with a gaming device or a single-board computer like the Raspberry Pi, where it often has to rapidly save and access small bits of data in random locations. Speed ratings If you look at a microSD card, you’ll see a buffet of numbers, letters and symbols. Most of these refer to the card’s speed class and performance ratings, which are determined by the SD Association. A card’s Video Speed Class, or V-rating, details its minimum sequential write speed, which is especially important when recording video from a camera. It ranges from V6 to V90. Most of the cards we tested had a V30 rating, so they have a sequential write speed of at least 30 MB/s. This should be enough to support up to 4K video at lower bitrates. Higher-rated V60 and V90 cards are usually better for capturing 8K, but they come at a much higher cost. The UHS Speed Class, or U-rating, also refers to a card’s minimum sequential write speed. It comes in two varieties: U3, which mandates a minimum of 30 MB/s, and U1, which is rated for 10 MB/s. The older Speed Class rating overlaps with the other two systems. It’s signified by a C symbol and goes from Class 2 to Class 10, with the number (again) indicating minimum sequential write speed. This rating is less relevant nowadays, but you may still see a “C10” logo on some cards. The Application Performance spec, marked by an A symbol, is an indicator of random read/write speeds. This is measured in IOPS, or input/output operations per second, rather than MB/s. There are two categories here: A1 cards offer a minimum random read speed of 1,500 IOPS and a minimum random write speed of 500 IOPS, while A2 cards bump those up to 4,000 IOPS and 2,000 IOPS, respectively. Both ratings also guarantee sequential write speeds of at least 10 MB/s. To keep it simple, most people should look for a card with V30, U3 and A2 ratings. It’s totally possible to get a solid card without those: A U1 card might be worth it if you just need a cheap, high-capacity option, for example. V60 and V90 cards are worth a look if you’re serious about shooting high-resolution photos and video as well. But overall, cards with the certifications above should provide the best blend of price and performance today. It’s important to emphasize that these ratings are baselines. Most V30 cards offer significantly higher write speeds than 30 MB/s, for instance, and some A1 cards can outperform some A2 models in practice. The speeds advertised by manufacturers aren’t always 100 percent accurate, either: Sometimes the card will be slower in real-world use, other times it may actually be a bit faster. Samsung UHS bus speeds The other spec to note is the card’s bus interface. Most microSD cards available today are UHS-I, which has a theoretical maximum speed of 104 MB/s. There are also UHS-II cards, which have an extra row of pins on the back and can reach up to 312 MB/s. (A UHS-III standard technically exists as well but hasn’t seen wide adoption.) These are labeled on the card with a Roman numeral I or II. UHS-II cards are typically the ones with those higher V60 or V90 ratings. If you shoot lots of 4K to 8K video or frequently use burst mode to capture ultra high-res photos, the performance gains of a good UHS-II card can save you time. However, these are typically much more expensive than UHS-I cards: This 128GB Lexar Professional Gold model, for instance, is a relative bargain at $35. While that's less than many UHS-II models we’ve seen in the past, it's still more than double the common street price of our top pick above. You need a device that’s compatible with the UHS-II interface to see any benefits, too, and stock for UHS-II cards is often spottier. For now, the higher speeds aren’t worth the price premium for most people, so we stuck mostly to UHS-I cards with our recommendations. Unlike traditional UHS-I cards, a microSD Express card like the SanDisk model on the right comes with a second row of pins to enable its improved performance. Jeff Dunn for Engadget microSD Express and the Nintendo Switch 2 The absolute fastest microSD cards you can buy, however, are based on a different interface called SD Express. This has technically been around for several years and now includes its own subset of speed classes, but the gist is that it's much faster than UHS-I or UHS-II: SanDisk’s recently released microSD Express card, one of the first commercially available models, advertises sequential read speeds up to 880MB/s. That’s quicker than some older SSDs. It’s a substantial upgrade that has largely held up in our testing, but very few popular devices natively support SD Express today. The first major exception is the Nintendo Switch 2, which is only compatible with the newer standard, as it’s needed to keep up with the performance demands of new handheld games. Besides SanDisk, manufacturers like Samsung, Lexar and PNY have already launched microSD Express cards to go with the console. The presumption is that having such a popular device embrace the tech will only further its adoption and drive prices down. But it’s still early days, and right now all microSD Express cards cost much more than the best UHS-I or even UHS-II options. Beyond the Switch 2, it’s possible to take advantage of these cards’ superior speeds with a dedicated SD Express card reader, but that adds even more to the final cost. It’s also worth noting that SD Express cards are not backwards compatible with UHS-II (or UHS-III), so if you try to plug one into a device with a UHS-II slot, it’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds. Still, they’re a must for Nintendo fans going forward, and the tech should have plenty of appeal if more gadgets that support the interface do arrive. For more on how the first wave of Express cards perform on the Switch 2, we've put together a dedicated buying guide just for Nintendo's console. A note on card readers and reaching advertised speeds While the UHS-I interface has a theoretical maximum of 104 MB/s, some UHS-I cards can exceed that speed through proprietary extensions. However, you need a compatible card reader and host device to take advantage of that extra performance. If you find a UHS-I card advertising speeds higher than 104 MB/s, this is what’s going on. You can see these limits in action with an original Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck: Both of those gaming devices support the UHS-I interface but don’t go beyond its official speed, flattening any sequential gains some cards may have elsewhere. (Differences in random read and write speeds can still matter, though.) The same thing will happen if you plug a more powerful UHS-II or SD Express card into a device that doesn’t accept those interfaces. The takeaway: Your microSD card will only be as fast as the slowest link in your chain. Warranty Many microSD cards are designed to be durable, with protection from water, extreme temperatures, X-rays and drops. Still, in case of catastrophe, a long warranty is always good to have. Many manufacturers offer lifetime or 10-year limited warranties, though we’ve noticed that “endurance” cards marketed to withstand more hours of writing are usually covered for a shorter period of time. For example, Samsung's Pro Endurance, a model aimed at security cameras and other monitoring devices, comes with a five-year warranty. Avoiding counterfeits The memory card market has had a particular problem with scammers selling fake products. To guard against this, only buy from a known brand and a reputable retailer such as Best Buy, B&H Photo or Adorama. If you shop at Amazon, only buy if the shipper and seller is Amazon.com. (That said, a handful of users have reported receiving counterfeits even from Amazon directly in the past, so exercise caution.) Remember: If a price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be wary of any retailer offering a significantly lower price than everyone else. Once you receive a card, check its packaging for any irregularities. You can run benchmark tests like CrystalDiskMark or BlackMagic Disk Speed Test to verify its speeds aren’t drastically lower than what’s advertised (or possible, given its specs). You can also use software that’s designed to verify the true capacity and performance of your card, such as H2testw and FakeFlashTest. A few of the microSD card readers we've used for testing. Jeff Dunn for Engadget How we test microSD cards We've put about 20 microSD cards through a series of tests to verify their sequential and random performance. These included benchmarks like CrystalDiskMark, BlackMagic Disk Speed Test, ATTO Disk Benchmark and AJA System Test, as well as a few “real-world” tests. We copied and pasted a small folder of photos about 1.15GB in size to and from each card, then did the same with a larger 12.2GB folder containing multiple file types and subfolders, timing the process each time. We also checked how each card performed on the Steam Deck, downloading games of varying sizes — including Stardew Valley, Aperture Desk Job, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Apex Legends — then timing how long it took to launch each game and load save files. We do multiple runs of each test to verify our findings and account for potential outliers. Where applicable, we used a Kingston USB 3.2 UHS-II reader to test each card on both Windows 11 and macOS Sequoia. However, if a card could be bundled with (or is specifically advertised to use) a proprietary reader, we mainly tested with that, since we figure that’s the one most interested buyers will end up using. For Windows testing, we used an Alienware gaming PC with an Intel Core i9-10900F, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. For macOS, we used a 2021 16-inch MacBook Pro with an Apple M1 Pro chip, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. If a reader couldn’t connect over USB-C, we used CalDigit’s TS4 dock to test the corresponding card on the MacBook. We tested the 128GB version of each card whenever we could, though we were only able to test higher-capacity models for a few options. We also reformatted each card before testing with the SD Association’s Memory Card Formatter tool. For microSD Express cards, we ran each model through a series of tests specific to the Switch 2, since that is the only popular device that actually supports the tech. You can read more about that process in our separate buying guide linked above. Recent updates December 2025: We’ve tested the Samsung P9 Express microSD Express card and noted it in our Switch 2 section above. We’ve also made a few edits to highlight recent price increases and stock shortages driven by the ongoing AI boom. November 2025: We’ve tested Walmart’s Onn microSD Express Card and edited our notes on the best cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 accordingly. September 2025: We’ve fleshed out our advice on buying a microSD Express card for the Nintendo Switch 2. May 2025: We’ve updated this guide to ensure our advice is accurate and to reflect the new Nintendo Switch 2’s use of microSD Express cards. We’ve also added testing notes for the Lexar Play Pro microSD Express card and the more standard PNY XLR8. We’ve removed mentions of a few cards that have seemingly been discontinued, including the original Kingston Canvas Go Plus, the Lexar Professional 1066x and the 2021 Samsung Evo Select.

          "content": "Most microSD cards are fast enough for boosting storage space and making simple file transfers, but some provide a little more value than others. If you’ve got a device that still accepts microSD cards — whether it’s an older gaming handheld, the new Nintendo Switch 2, a dash cam, a drone or an Android tablet — we’ve scoured the market and put close to 20 top contenders through a number of benchmark tests. You can find our recommendations for the best microSD cards below, alongside some general shopping advice worth knowing before you buy. Best microSD cards of 2026 Best microSD Express cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 Jeff Dunn for Engadget Read our full guide to the best microSD Express cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 Let’s be clear about this: Unless you plan to own a Nintendo Switch 2 in the near future, you do not need a high-speed microSD Express card just yet. Nintendo’s gaming handheld is the only popular device that natively supports this standard right now, and microSD Express cards themselves are highly expensive compared to more traditional options. Still, if you do want to increase a Switch 2’s storage, they’re your only choice. Fortunately, determining exactly which model to buy for the console is pretty straightforward: Get whichever one you can find in stock, in the capacity you want, at a price you can stomach. We benchmarked several microSD Express cards for a separate Switch 2 guide, and for the most part, the performance differences between them weren’t great enough to justify paying extra for any particular model. Loading times weren’t quite identical with every test we ran, but the cards were extremely close in most games and common scenarios. The few times when there was a notable gap — fast-traveling to a particularly resource-heavy region in Cyberpunk 2077, for instance — the gulf between the slowest and fastest card was only ever about four or five seconds at most. That’s not nothing, but it’s also not something most people are likely to fret over unless they have a stopwatch handy. The SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro.

Generally, most microSD cards have faster read speeds than write speeds. These metrics can then be broken down into sequential and random performance. Sequential read and write speeds matter when you’re trying to access (read) or save (write) long, constant streams of data, such as opening a large video or copying a big batch of files from a PC. If you want to use a microSD card for media storage, this is particularly important. Random performance, meanwhile, is about how quickly a card can read and write small files scattered throughout the device. Since random read/write speeds are much lower than sequential ones, storage device makers tend not to advertise them as loudly. But they’re important if you use a card with a gaming device or a single-board computer like the Raspberry Pi, where it often has to rapidly save and access small bits of data in random locations. Speed ratings If you look at a microSD card, you’ll see a buffet of numbers, letters and symbols. Most of these refer to the card’s speed class and performance ratings, which are determined by the SD Association. A card’s Video Speed Class, or V-rating, details its minimum sequential write speed, which is especially important when recording video from a camera. It ranges from V6 to V90. Most of the cards we tested had a V30 rating, so they have a sequential write speed of at least 30 MB/s. This should be enough to support up to 4K video at lower bitrates. Higher-rated V60 and V90 cards are usually better for capturing 8K, but they come at a much higher cost. The UHS Speed Class, or U-rating, also refers to a card’s minimum sequential write speed. It comes in two varieties: U3, which mandates a minimum of 30 MB/s, and U1, which is rated for 10 MB/s. The older Speed Class rating overlaps with the other two systems. It’s signified by a C symbol and goes from Class 2 to Class 10, with the number (again) indicating minimum sequential write speed. This rating is less relevant nowadays, but you may still see a “C10” logo on some cards. The Application Performance spec, marked by an A symbol, is an indicator of random read/write speeds. This is measured in IOPS, or input/output operations per second, rather than MB/s. There are two categories here: A1 cards offer a minimum random read speed of 1,500 IOPS and a minimum random write speed of 500 IOPS, while A2 cards bump those up to 4,000 IOPS and 2,000 IOPS, respectively. Both ratings also guarantee sequential write speeds of at least 10 MB/s. To keep it simple, most people should look for a card with V30, U3 and A2 ratings. It’s totally possible to get a solid card without those: A U1 card might be worth it if you just need a cheap, high-capacity option, for example. V60 and V90 cards are worth a look if you’re serious about shooting high-resolution photos and video as well. But overall, cards with the certifications above should provide the best blend of price and performance today. It’s important to emphasize that these ratings are baselines. Most V30 cards offer significantly higher write speeds than 30 MB/s, for instance, and some A1 cards can outperform some A2 models in practice. The speeds advertised by manufacturers aren’t always 100 percent accurate, either: Sometimes the card will be slower in real-world use, other times it may actually be a bit faster. Samsung UHS bus speeds The other spec to note is the card’s bus interface. Most microSD cards available today are UHS-I, which has a theoretical maximum speed of 104 MB/s. There are also UHS-II cards, which have an extra row of pins on the back and can reach up to 312 MB/s. (A UHS-III standard technically exists as well but hasn’t seen wide adoption.) These are labeled on the card with a Roman numeral I or II. UHS-II cards are typically the ones with those higher V60 or V90 ratings. If you shoot lots of 4K to 8K video or frequently use burst mode to capture ultra high-res photos, the performance gains of a good UHS-II card can save you time. However, these are typically much more expensive than UHS-I cards: This 128GB Lexar Professional Gold model, for instance, is a relative bargain at $35. While that's less than many UHS-II models we’ve seen in the past, it's still more than double the common street price of our top pick above. You need a device that’s compatible with the UHS-II interface to see any benefits, too, and stock for UHS-II cards is often spottier. For now, the higher speeds aren’t worth the price premium for most people, so we stuck mostly to UHS-I cards with our recommendations. Unlike traditional UHS-I cards, a microSD Express card like the SanDisk model on the right comes with a second row of pins to enable its improved performance. Jeff Dunn for Engadget microSD Express and the Nintendo Switch 2 The absolute fastest microSD cards you can buy, however, are based on a different interface called SD Express. This has technically been around for several years and now includes its own subset of speed classes, but the gist is that it's much faster than UHS-I or UHS-II: SanDisk’s recently released microSD Express card, one of the first commercially available models, advertises sequential read speeds up to 880MB/s. That’s quicker than some older SSDs. It’s a substantial upgrade that has largely held up in our testing, but very few popular devices natively support SD Express today. The first major exception is the Nintendo Switch 2, which is only compatible with the newer standard, as it’s needed to keep up with the performance demands of new handheld games. Besides SanDisk, manufacturers like Samsung, Lexar and PNY have already launched microSD Express cards to go with the console. The presumption is that having such a popular device embrace the tech will only further its adoption and drive prices down. But it’s still early days, and right now all microSD Express cards cost much more than the best UHS-I or even UHS-II options. Beyond the Switch 2, it’s possible to take advantage of these cards’ superior speeds with a dedicated SD Express card reader, but that adds even more to the final cost. It’s also worth noting that SD Express cards are not backwards compatible with UHS-II (or UHS-III), so if you try to plug one into a device with a UHS-II slot, it’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds. Still, they’re a must for Nintendo fans going forward, and the tech should have plenty of appeal if more gadgets that support the interface do arrive. For more on how the first wave of Express cards perform on the Switch 2, we've put together a dedicated buying guide just for Nintendo's console. A note on card readers and reaching advertised speeds While the UHS-I interface has a theoretical maximum of 104 MB/s, some UHS-I cards can exceed that speed through proprietary extensions. However, you need a compatible card reader and host device to take advantage of that extra performance. If you find a UHS-I card advertising speeds higher than 104 MB/s, this is what’s going on. You can see these limits in action with an original Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck: Both of those gaming devices support the UHS-I interface but don’t go beyond its official speed, flattening any sequential gains some cards may have elsewhere. (Differences in random read and write speeds can still matter, though.) The same thing will happen if you plug a more powerful UHS-II or SD Express card into a device that doesn’t accept those interfaces. The takeaway: Your microSD card will only be as fast as the slowest link in your chain. Warranty Many microSD cards are designed to be durable, with protection from water, extreme temperatures, X-rays and drops. Still, in case of catastrophe, a long warranty is always good to have. Many manufacturers offer lifetime or 10-year limited warranties, though we’ve noticed that “endurance” cards marketed to withstand more hours of writing are usually covered for a shorter period of time. For example, Samsung's Pro Endurance, a model aimed at security cameras and other monitoring devices, comes with a five-year warranty. Avoiding counterfeits The memory card market has had a particular problem with scammers selling fake products. To guard against this, only buy from a known brand and a reputable retailer such as Best Buy, B&H Photo or Adorama. If you shop at Amazon, only buy if the shipper and seller is Amazon.com. (That said, a handful of users have reported receiving counterfeits even from Amazon directly in the past, so exercise caution.) Remember: If a price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be wary of any retailer offering a significantly lower price than everyone else. Once you receive a card, check its packaging for any irregularities. You can run benchmark tests like CrystalDiskMark or BlackMagic Disk Speed Test to verify its speeds aren’t drastically lower than what’s advertised (or possible, given its specs). You can also use software that’s designed to verify the true capacity and performance of your card, such as H2testw and FakeFlashTest. A few of the microSD card readers we've used for testing. Jeff Dunn for Engadget How we test microSD cards We've put about 20 microSD cards through a series of tests to verify their sequential and random performance. These included benchmarks like CrystalDiskMark, BlackMagic Disk Speed Test, ATTO Disk Benchmark and AJA System Test, as well as a few “real-world” tests. We copied and pasted a small folder of photos about 1.15GB in size to and from each card, then did the same with a larger 12.2GB folder containing multiple file types and subfolders, timing the process each time. We also checked how each card performed on the Steam Deck, downloading games of varying sizes — including Stardew Valley, Aperture Desk Job, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Apex Legends — then timing how long it took to launch each game and load save files. We do multiple runs of each test to verify our findings and account for potential outliers. Where applicable, we used a Kingston USB 3.2 UHS-II reader to test each card on both Windows 11 and macOS Sequoia. However, if a card could be bundled with (or is specifically advertised to use) a proprietary reader, we mainly tested with that, since we figure that’s the one most interested buyers will end up using. For Windows testing, we used an Alienware gaming PC with an Intel Core i9-10900F, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. For macOS, we used a 2021 16-inch MacBook Pro with an Apple M1 Pro chip, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. If a reader couldn’t connect over USB-C, we used CalDigit’s TS4 dock to test the corresponding card on the MacBook. We tested the 128GB version of each card whenever we could, though we were only able to test higher-capacity models for a few options. We also reformatted each card before testing with the SD Association’s Memory Card Formatter tool. For microSD Express cards, we ran each model through a series of tests specific to the Switch 2, since that is the only popular device that actually supports the tech. You can read more about that process in our separate buying guide linked above. Recent updates December 2025: We’ve tested the Samsung P9 Express microSD Express card and noted it in our Switch 2 section above. We’ve also made a few edits to highlight recent price increases and stock shortages driven by the ongoing AI boom. November 2025: We’ve tested Walmart’s Onn microSD Express Card and edited our notes on the best cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 accordingly. September 2025: We’ve fleshed out our advice on buying a microSD Express card for the Nintendo Switch 2. May 2025: We’ve updated this guide to ensure our advice is accurate and to reflect the new Nintendo Switch 2’s use of microSD Express cards. We’ve also added testing notes for the Lexar Play Pro microSD Express card and the more standard PNY XLR8. We’ve removed mentions of a few cards that have seemingly been discontinued, including the original Kingston Canvas Go Plus, the Lexar Professional 1066x and the 2021 Samsung Evo Select. We plan to test more new microSD Express cards for a future update. February 2025: We’ve updated this guide with a new top pick: the Lexar Professional Silver Plus. The Samsung Pro Plus, our previous recommendation, stays as a runner-up. We’ve also added SanDisk’s recently released microSD Express card as a pick for those who want the absolute fastest card possible, albeit with heavy caveats. This is one of the first microSD cards to use the SD Express bus interface, so we’ve included more details on what that entails in our “what to look for in a microSD card” section. Lastly, we’ve removed our write-up for SanDisk’s Apex Legends card, as it appears to have been discontinued, and included testing notes for a couple of the company’s more recent releases. November 2024: We've checked back with this guide to ensure our recommendations are still accurate and made light edits for clarity. August 2024: We’ve updated this guide to note the recently released 1TB models for three of our top picks: the Samsung Pro Plus, the Kingston Canvas Go Plus and the Samsung Evo Select. We’ve also made sure all pricing details are as up to date as they can be.

You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack. At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an \"essential accessory\" for some users in his iPhone Air review.

After years of speculation, multiple reports now suggest Apple could be aiming for a launch in the second half of 2026, with new details trickling out about the phone’s design, display tech and where it might sit in the iPhone lineup.As with any unannounced Apple product, nothing is locked in. Features can change, timelines can move and some ideas may never make it beyond internal testing. That said, recent reporting from supply-chain sources, analysts and leakers gives us a clearer picture of how Apple might approach its first foldable and how it could try to set itself apart from rivals like Samsung and Google.Below, we’ve rounded up the most credible iPhone Fold rumors so far, covering everything from possible release timing and form factor to display details, cameras and pricing. We’ll keep updating this post as new information emerges.When could the iPhone Fold launch?Rumors of a foldable iPhone date back as far as 2017, but more recent reporting suggests Apple has finally locked onto a realistic window. Most sources now point to fall 2026, likely alongside the iPhone 18 lineup.Mark Gurman has gone back and forth on timing, initially suggesting Apple could launch “as early as 2026,” before later writing that the device would ship at the end of 2026 and sell primarily in 2027. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also repeatedly cited the second half of 2026 as Apple’s target.Some reports still claim the project could slip into 2027 if Apple runs into manufacturing or durability issues, particularly around the hinge or display. Given Apple’s history of delaying products that it feels aren’t ready, that remains a real possibility.What will the iPhone Fold look like?Current consensus suggests Apple has settled on a book-style foldable design, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, rather than a clamshell flip phone.When unfolded, the iPhone Fold is expected to resemble a small tablet like the iPad mini (8.3 inches). Based on the rumor mill, though, the iPhone Fold may be a touch smaller, with an internal display measuring around 7.7 to 7.8 inches. When closed, it should function like a conventional smartphone, with an outer display in the 5.5-inch range.CAD leaks and alleged case-maker molds suggest the device may be shorter and wider than a standard iPhone when folded, creating a squarer footprint that better matches the aspect ratio of the inner display. Several reports have also pointed to the iPhone Air as a potential preview of Apple’s foldable design work, with its unusually thin chassis widely interpreted as a look at what one half of a future foldable iPhone could resemble.If that theory holds, it could help explain the Fold’s rumored dimensions. Thickness is expected to land between roughly 4.5 and 5.6mm when unfolded, putting it in a similar range to the iPhone Air, and just over 9 to 11mm when folded, depending on the final hinge design and internal layering.iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone AirEngadgetDisplay and the crease questionThe display is arguably the biggest challenge for any foldable phone, and it’s an area where Apple appears to have invested years of development.Multiple reports say Apple will rely on Samsung Display as its primary supplier. At CES 2026, Samsung showcased a new crease-less foldable OLED panel, which several sources — including Bloomberg — suggested could be the same technology Apple plans to use.According to these reports, the panel combines a flexible OLED with a laser-drilled metal support plate that disperses stress when folding. The goal is a display with a nearly invisible crease, something Apple reportedly considers essential before entering the foldable market.If Apple does use this panel, it would mark a notable improvement over current foldables, which still show visible creasing under certain lighting conditions.Cameras and biometricsCamera rumors suggest Apple is planning a four-camera setup. That may include:Two rear cameras (main and ultra-wide, both rumored at 48MP)One punch-hole camera on the outer displayOne under-display camera on the inner screenSeveral sources claim Apple will avoid Face ID entirely on the iPhone Fold. Instead, it’s expected to rely on Touch ID built into the power button, similar to recent iPad models. This would allow Apple to keep both displays free of notches or Dynamic Island cutouts.Under-display camera technology has historically produced lower image quality, but a rumored 24MP sensor would be a significant step up compared to existing foldables, which typically use much lower-resolution sensors.iPhone Fold’s hinge and materialsThe hinge is another area where Apple may diverge from competitors. Multiple reports claim Apple will use Liquidmetal, which is a long-standing trade name for a metallic glass alloy the company has previously used in smaller components. While often referred to as “liquid metal” or “Liquid Metal” in reports, Liquidmetal is the branding Apple has historically associated with the material.Liquidmetal is said to be stronger and more resistant to deformation than titanium, while remaining relatively lightweight. If accurate, this could help improve long-term durability and reduce wear on the foldable display.Leaks from Jon Prosser also reference a metal plate beneath the display that works in tandem with the hinge to minimize creasing — a claim that aligns with reporting from Korean and Chinese supply-chain sources.Battery and other components Battery life is another potential differentiator. According to Ming-Chi Kuo and multiple Asian supply-chain reports, Apple is testing high-density battery cells in the 5,000 to 5,800mAh range.That would make it the largest battery ever used in an iPhone, and competitive with (or larger than) batteries in current Android foldables. The device is also expected to use a future A-series chip and Apple’s in-house modem.PriceNone of this will come cheap, that’s for certain. Nearly every report agrees that the iPhone Fold will be Apple’s most expensive iPhone ever.Estimates currently place the price between $2,000 and $2,500 in the US. Bloomberg has said the price will be “at least $2,000,” while other analysts have narrowed the likely range to around $2,100 and $2,300. That positions the iPhone Fold well above the iPhone Pro Max and closer to Apple’s high-end Macs and iPads.Despite years of rumors, there’s still plenty that remains unclear. Apple hasn’t confirmed the name “iPhone Fold,” final dimensions, software features or how iOS would adapt to a folding form factor. Durability, repairability and long-term reliability are also open questions. For now, the safest assumption is that Apple is taking its time and that many of these details could still change before launch.

          "standfirst": "Since Apple finally put its mysterious and long-suffering Project Titan out to pasture, we've wondered what a Jony Ive-designed Apple Car might have looked like. Today, we might have a clue. This, though, is no Apple Car. It's the Ferrari Luce (\"light\" in Italian), the actual name for the EV formerly known as Elettrica, and I'm fresh from getting a walkthrough of the thing from Sir Ive himself. At a glance things look like you might have expected, but there are a few surprises here.While Ferrari has sold hybrids in some form or another since 2013's LaFerrari, Luce (née Elettrica) will be the company's first all-electric machine. We got our first look underneath back in October, when we saw the chassis, battery pack and other details that pointed to this being a larger, more family-friendly machine than your average Ferrari. Last week, I got a look at the next major component, the interior, which comes courtesy of LoveFrom.LoveFrom is the house that Jony Ive founded after leaving Apple in 2019. The obsessive design firm, which currently numbers about 60 employees, was acquired by OpenAI for $6.5 billion last year. LoveFrom has thus far taken on a medley of projects, like the $60,000 Linn Sondek LP12 turntable, but the Luce could be among the company's biggest projects so far — at least in terms of literal dimensions.If you're familiar with the designs that Apple produced under Ive's tenure, particularly in the era beginning with the iPhone 4, you'll feel right at home here. The overall aesthetic is one dominated by squircles and circles, all with absolute, minute perfection and symmetry. Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFromFerrariAt first blush, it's a bit clinical, but dig deeper, start poking and prodding, and you'll see there's a real sense of charm here. Fun little details and genuinely satisfying tactility begin to reveal themselves. The key, for example, has a yellow panel with an E Ink background. Push the key into the magnetized receiver in the center console, and the yellow on the key dims, moving across to glow through the top of the glass shifter. It’s meant to symbolize a sort of transference of life.The shifter isn't the only thing that's glass. There are 40-odd pieces of Corning Gorilla Glass scattered throughout the cockpit, everything from the shifter surround to the slightly convex lenses in the gauge cluster. What isn't glass is aluminum, much of it anodized in your choice of three colors: gray, dark gray and rose gold. Yes, all that sure does sound like I'm writing about a new iPhone and not the latest Ferrari. But where Apple has been pruning every physical control it possibly can from its devices lately, LoveFrom will insert some great tactility in the Luce. The shifter moves through its detents satisfyingly, the air vents open and close with a clear snick and the paddles behind the steering wheel pop with a great feel.My favorite feature is the windshield wiper control, a little dial in the upper-right of the steering wheel face. It features a tiny lens that magnifies the current setting. It's actually magnifying one of four custom OLED panels, 200 ppi units from Samsung, cut and shaped to deliver LoveFrom's ornate style. Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFromThe gauge cluster behind the steering wheel, or binnacle as it's more formally called here, is two OLED displays stacked on top of each other, with a physical needle sandwiched between serving as a pseudo-tachometer for this car without an engine. The gauges change and morph as you move from one mode to the next. The center display is a 10.12-inch OLED perforated with plenty of holes to allow some pleasingly chunky toggle switches through, plus a glass volume knob. The little clock in the upper-right can turn into a stopwatch or a compass, with its needles swinging about depending on the mode. The whole central control panel pivots and swivels. Just grab the big handle below and drag it where you want it. The attention to detail on everything is astonishing. Even the rails that hold the seats to the floor are gently shaped and anodized to match the rest of the interior. Ive was on hand to unveil the interior, clearly a little nervous about showing all this for the first time. After five years of working confidentially on this topic, Ive said he was \"enormously excited\" and \"completely terrified\" to provide our first real glimpse at the Luce. Marc Newson, who founded LoveFrom with Ive, said: \"Jony and I share a really, really deep interest in automotive things and vehicles. Actually, I'd go so far as to say that that is probably a hobby of both of ours.\"Both Ive and Newson own many vintage machines, and Ive said that modern cars \"are missing some things that we love about our old Ferraris.\" Things like tactility. \"It was very clear to us that we needed to figure out as many ways as possible to viscerally and physically connect to the interface,\" Ive said.Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFromSo, while the Luce does have that pivoting touchscreen, it's far from the vehicle's primary interface. Ive said he hopes that physical connection and all the clever touches create a uniquely charming vehicle. Ive told me that the LoveFrom team has genuinely enjoyed working with Ferrari. \"It's been really lovely,\" he said, and he praised Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna's dedication to this project and where it might lead down the road. \"Benedetto is an amazing engineer,\" he said, \"he's really interested in what can be learned more broadly.\"The biggest challenge might have been working within the automotive industry. Here, design, form and function are key, but safety is of the utmost importance. \"It's very hard,\" Ive told me. \"I've never worked in an area that's so regulated. Some of it's great, because you understand why, and people's safety is certainly important, but some of it drives you nuts.\"It's far and away the most exciting and fresh interior I've seen outside of the ultra-rare machines like the $4 million Bugatti Tourbillon. But it's so clinically precise and refined that it lacks the rough and raw feel that typifies many classic Ferraris. Whether that's a good or a bad thing will be debated endlessly, and I look forward to reading your comments, but I do figure it'll go a long way to delivering the kind of new clientele that Ferrari must be targeting with the Luce. Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFromUltimately, whether anyone will want one is hugely dependent on how good the rest of the car looks and how much it will cost. Those are questions we still can't answer, at least not until May, when CEO Vigna says we can expect the Luce's full reveal. For Ive, though, it seemed like that won't be the end of the road for this automotive journey. \"At the end of a project, there are two products. There's what you've made, and there's what you've learned. I've always been fascinated by what you've learned,\" he told me. \"And honestly, we've learned so much.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/inside-ferraris-luce-ev-the-jony-ive-interior-is-here-130000211.html?src=rss",

Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFromFerrariAt first blush, it's a bit clinical, but dig deeper, start poking and prodding, and you'll see there's a real sense of charm here. Fun little details and genuinely satisfying tactility begin to reveal themselves. The key, for example, has a yellow panel with an E Ink background. Push the key into the magnetized receiver in the center console, and the yellow on the key dims, moving across to glow through the top of the glass shifter. It’s meant to symbolize a sort of transference of life.The shifter isn't the only thing that's glass. There are 40-odd pieces of Corning Gorilla Glass scattered throughout the cockpit, everything from the shifter surround to the slightly convex lenses in the gauge cluster. What isn't glass is aluminum, much of it anodized in your choice of three colors: gray, dark gray and rose gold. Yes, all that sure does sound like I'm writing about a new iPhone and not the latest Ferrari. But where Apple has been pruning every physical control it possibly can from its devices lately, LoveFrom will insert some great tactility in the Luce. The shifter moves through its detents satisfyingly, the air vents open and close with a clear snick and the paddles behind the steering wheel pop with a great feel.My favorite feature is the windshield wiper control, a little dial in the upper-right of the steering wheel face. It features a tiny lens that magnifies the current setting. It's actually magnifying one of four custom OLED panels, 200 ppi units from Samsung, cut and shaped to deliver LoveFrom's ornate style. Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFromThe gauge cluster behind the steering wheel, or binnacle as it's more formally called here, is two OLED displays stacked on top of each other, with a physical needle sandwiched between serving as a pseudo-tachometer for this car without an engine. The gauges change and morph as you move from one mode to the next. The center display is a 10.12-inch OLED perforated with plenty of holes to allow some pleasingly chunky toggle switches through, plus a glass volume knob. The little clock in the upper-right can turn into a stopwatch or a compass, with its needles swinging about depending on the mode. The whole central control panel pivots and swivels. Just grab the big handle below and drag it where you want it. The attention to detail on everything is astonishing. Even the rails that hold the seats to the floor are gently shaped and anodized to match the rest of the interior. Ive was on hand to unveil the interior, clearly a little nervous about showing all this for the first time. After five years of working confidentially on this topic, Ive said he was \"enormously excited\" and \"completely terrified\" to provide our first real glimpse at the Luce. Marc Newson, who founded LoveFrom with Ive, said: \"Jony and I share a really, really deep interest in automotive things and vehicles. Actually, I'd go so far as to say that that is probably a hobby of both of ours.\"Both Ive and Newson own many vintage machines, and Ive said that modern cars \"are missing some things that we love about our old Ferraris.\" Things like tactility. \"It was very clear to us that we needed to figure out as many ways as possible to viscerally and physically connect to the interface,\" Ive said.Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFromSo, while the Luce does have that pivoting touchscreen, it's far from the vehicle's primary interface. Ive said he hopes that physical connection and all the clever touches create a uniquely charming vehicle. Ive told me that the LoveFrom team has genuinely enjoyed working with Ferrari. \"It's been really lovely,\" he said, and he praised Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna's dedication to this project and where it might lead down the road. \"Benedetto is an amazing engineer,\" he said, \"he's really interested in what can be learned more broadly.\"The biggest challenge might have been working within the automotive industry. Here, design, form and function are key, but safety is of the utmost importance. \"It's very hard,\" Ive told me. \"I've never worked in an area that's so regulated. Some of it's great, because you understand why, and people's safety is certainly important, but some of it drives you nuts.\"It's far and away the most exciting and fresh interior I've seen outside of the ultra-rare machines like the $4 million Bugatti Tourbillon. But it's so clinically precise and refined that it lacks the rough and raw feel that typifies many classic Ferraris. Whether that's a good or a bad thing will be debated endlessly, and I look forward to reading your comments, but I do figure it'll go a long way to delivering the kind of new clientele that Ferrari must be targeting with the Luce. Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFromUltimately, whether anyone will want one is hugely dependent on how good the rest of the car looks and how much it will cost. Those are questions we still can't answer, at least not until May, when CEO Vigna says we can expect the Luce's full reveal. For Ive, though, it seemed like that won't be the end of the road for this automotive journey. \"At the end of a project, there are two products. There's what you've made, and there's what you've learned. I've always been fascinated by what you've learned,\" he told me. \"And honestly, we've learned so much.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/inside-ferraris-luce-ev-the-jony-ive-interior-is-here-130000211.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "A team of researchers led by Nvidia has released DreamDojo, a new AI system designed to teach robots how to interact with the physical world by watching tens of thousands of hours of human video — a development that could significantly reduce the time and cost required to train the next generation of humanoid machines.The research, published this month and involving collaborators from UC Berkeley, Stanford, the University of Texas at Austin, and several other institutions, introduces what the team calls \"the first robot world model of its kind that demonstrates strong generalization to diverse objects and environments after post-training.\"At the core of DreamDojo is what the researchers describe as \"a large-scale video dataset\" comprising \"44k hours of diverse human egocentric videos, the largest dataset to date for world model pretraining.\" The dataset, called DreamDojo-HV, is a dramatic leap in scale — \"15x longer duration, 96x more skills, and 2,000x more scenes than the previously largest dataset for world model training,\" according to the project documentation.Inside the two-phase training system that teaches robots to see like humansThe system operates in two distinct phases. First, DreamDojo \"acquires comprehensive physical knowledge from large-scale human datasets by pre-training with latent actions.\" Then it undergoes \"post-training on the target embodiment with continuous robot actions\" — essentially learning general physics from watching humans, then fine-tuning that knowledge for specific robot hardware.For enterprises considering humanoid robots, this approach addresses a stubborn bottleneck. Teaching a robot to manipulate objects in unstructured environments traditionally requires massive amounts of robot-specific demonstration data — expensive and time-consuming to collect. DreamDojo sidesteps this problem by leveraging existing human video, allowing robots to learn from observation before ever touching a physical object.One of the technical breakthroughs is speed. Through a distillation process, the researchers achieved \"real-time interactions at 10 FPS for over 1 minute\" — a capability that enables practical applications like live teleoperation and on-the-fly planning. The team demonstrated the system working across multiple robot platforms, including the GR-1, G1, AgiBot, and YAM humanoid robots, showing what they call \"realistic action-conditioned rollouts\" across \"a wide range of environments and object interactions.\"Why Nvidia is betting big on robotics as AI infrastructure spending soarsThe release comes at a pivotal moment for Nvidia&#x27;s robotics ambitions — and for the broader AI industry. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, CEO Jensen Huang declared that AI robotics represents a \"once-in-a-generation\" opportunity, particularly for regions with strong manufacturing bases. According to Digitimes, Huang has also stated that the next decade will be \"a critical period of accelerated development for robotics technology.\"The financial stakes are enormous. Huang told CNBC&#x27;s \"Halftime Report\" on February 6 that the tech industry&#x27;s capital expenditures — potentially reaching $660 billion this year from major hyperscalers — are \"justified, appropriate and sustainable.\" He characterized the current moment as \"the largest infrastructure buildout in human history,\" with companies like Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft dramatically increasing their AI spending.That infrastructure push is already reshaping the robotics landscape. Robotics startups raised a record $26.5 billion in 2025, according to data from Dealroom. European industrial giants including Siemens, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo have announced robotics partnerships in the past year, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk has claimed that 80 percent of his company&#x27;s future value will come from its Optimus humanoid robots.How DreamDojo could transform enterprise robot deployment and testingFor technical decision-makers evaluating humanoid robots, DreamDojo&#x27;s most immediate value may lie in its simulation capabilities. The researchers highlight downstream applications including \"reliable policy evaluation without real-world deployment and model-based planning for test-time improvement\" — capabilities that could let companies simulate robot behavior extensively before committing to costly physical trials.This matters because the gap between laboratory demonstrations and factory floors remains significant. A robot that performs flawlessly in controlled conditions often struggles with the unpredictable variations of real-world environments — different lighting, unfamiliar objects, unexpected obstacles. By training on 44,000 hours of diverse human video spanning thousands of scenes and nearly 100 distinct skills, DreamDojo aims to build the kind of general physical intuition that makes robots adaptable rather than brittle.The research team, led by Linxi \"Jim\" Fan, Joel Jang, and Yuke Zhu, with Shenyuan Gao and William Liang as co-first authors, has indicated that code will be released publicly, though a timeline was not specified.The bigger picture: Nvidia&#x27;s transformation from gaming giant to robotics powerhouseWhether DreamDojo translates into commercial robotics products remains to be seen. But the research signals where Nvidia&#x27;s ambitions are heading as the company increasingly positions itself beyond its gaming roots. As Kyle Barr observed at Gizmodo earlier this month, Nvidia now views \"anything related to gaming and the &#x27;personal computer&#x27;\" as \"outliers on Nvidia&#x27;s quarterly spreadsheets.\"The shift reflects a calculated bet: that the future of computing is physical, not just digital. Nvidia has already invested $10 billion in Anthropic and signaled plans to invest heavily in OpenAI&#x27;s next funding round. DreamDojo suggests the company sees humanoid robots as the next frontier where its AI expertise and chip dominance can converge.For now, the 44,000 hours of human video at the heart of DreamDojo represent something more fundamental than a technical benchmark. They represent a theory — that robots can learn to navigate our world by watching us live in it. The machines, it turns out, have been taking notes.",

          "standfirst": "Apple’s iPhone lineup has grown more complicated over the years, with multiple models targeting different kinds of buyers. Some prioritize camera performance and display quality while others focus on design or price, and not everyone needs the most powerful option on the shelf. If you’re planning an upgrade, the challenge isn’t whether Apple makes a good phone; it’s figuring out which iPhone actually makes sense for you based on how you use it.We test every new iPhone Apple releases, comparing performance, cameras, battery life and long-term value. In this guide, we break down the current lineup to highlight the best iPhones for different needs, from the best all-around picks to more specialized options that trade raw power for affordability or style.For consistency, our recommendations are based on Apple’s standard pricing for unlocked models sold directly through Apple. Deals from carriers, third-party retailers or refurbished sellers can shift the value math, but this guide is meant to help you choose the right model first — then decide where to buy it. Best iPhones for 2026 The rest of Apple's iPhone lineup in 2026 The iPhone 16. Billy Steele for Engadget Apple iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus Apple is still selling the last-gen iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus for $699 and $799, respectively, but the improvements made with the iPhone 17 have forced both devices into something of a no man’s land. The 16 Plus and its 6.7-inch display might be worth it if you want a large-screen iPhone for a much lower price than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, but you’ll miss out on the base model’s 120Hz always-on display and upgraded dual-camera setup. If you just want a usable iPhone for as little as possible, meanwhile, the iPhone 16e is acceptable for $100 less. In general, we think the iPhone 17 is worth the extra $100; its 6.3-inch display helps it split the difference between the 16 and 16 Plus anyway. iPhone FAQs Brian Oh for Engadget When is the best time of year to buy an iPhone? The best time to buy an iPhone, or really any product, is whenever you need one. But if you want to maximize how long your iPhone is considered “current,” plan to upgrade in late September. Apple almost always introduces its new core models around then. SE and “e” iPhones, meanwhile, have arrived between February and April, but those aren’t guaranteed annual releases. Cash discounts on new unlocked iPhones are rare, so there usually isn’t much reason to wait for a deal before buying (as is often the case with Samsung or Google phones). Carriers will run their own sales, but those typically involve locking you into years-long service plans. The exception would be if you specifically want an older iPhone, since Apple typically cuts the price of its last-gen devices by $100 or more when it introduces a new model. So, for instance, if you know you won’t care about the inevitable iPhone 17’s upgrades, you could wait until that device is announced and get the iPhone 16 for a little cheaper. How long does an iPhone last? This depends on the person and how they define “last.” If we had to give a broad estimate, we’d say most iPhone users keep their device between two and four years. If you’re particularly sensitive to performance and camera improvements, you might want to upgrade on the earlier side of that timeline. If you’re not as picky, you could hold out for even longer — though you’ll likely want to get a battery replacement sometime around the three- or four-year mark (or whenever you notice your battery life has severely degraded). Software support shouldn’t be a problem regardless: Apple is renowned for keeping its devices up-to-date long-term, and the current iOS 26 update is available on iPhones dating back to 2019. Most of those older phones don’t support Apple Intelligence, so there isn’t total parity, but that’s not a big loss in the grand scheme of things. How do I know how old my iPhone is? Go to your iPhone’s Settings, then tap General > About. You should see the Model Name right near the top. You can also tap the Model Number below that, then verify the resulting four-digit code on Apple’s identification page to further confirm. If you don’t want to use software, for whatever reason, you can also find your iPhone’s model number printed within its USB-C or Lightning port, if the device lacks a SIM tray. For older devices, you can alternatively find that number within the SIM slot or — if you’re still hanging onto an iPhone 7 or older — right on the back of the handset.

          "title": "AI's GPU problem is actually a data delivery problem",
          "standfirst": "Presented by F5As enterprises pour billions into GPU infrastructure for AI workloads, many are discovering that their expensive compute resources sit idle far more than expected. The culprit isn&#x27;t the hardware. It’s the often-invisible data delivery layer between storage and compute that&#x27;s starving GPUs of the information they need.\"While people are focusing their attention, justifiably so, on GPUs, because they&#x27;re very significant investments, those are rarely the limiting factor,\" says Mark Menger, solutions architect at F5. \"They&#x27;re capable of more work. They&#x27;re waiting on data.\"AI performance increasingly depends on an independent, programmable control point between AI frameworks and object storage — one that most enterprises haven’t deliberately architected. As AI workloads scale, bottlenecks and instability happens when AI frameworks are tightly coupled to specific storage endpoints during scaling events, failures, and cloud transitions.\"Traditional storage access patterns were not designed for highly parallel, bursty, multi-consumer AI workloads,\" says Maggie Stringfellow, VP, product management - BIG-IP. \"Efficient AI data movement requires a distinct data delivery layer designed to abstract, optimize, and secure data flows independently of storage systems, because GPU economics make inefficiency immediately visible and expensive.\"Why AI workloads overwhelm object storageThese bidirectional patterns include massive ingestion from continuous data capture, simulation output, and model checkpoints. Combined with read-intensive training and inference workloads, they stress the tightly coupled infrastructure upon which the storage systems are reliant.While storage vendors have done significant work in scaling the data throughput into and out of their systems, that focus on throughput alone creates knock-on effects across the switching, traffic management, and security layers coupled to storage.The stress on S3-compatible systems from AI workloads is multidimensional and differs significantly from traditional application patterns. It&#x27;s less about raw throughput and more about concurrency, metadata pressure, and fan-out considerations. Training and fine-tuning create particularly challenging patterns, like massive parallel reads of small to mid-size objects. These workloads also involve repeated passes through training data across epochs and periodic checkpoint write bursts.RAG workloads introduce their own complexity through request amplification.

The stress concentration is less about capacity, storage system speed, and more about request management and traffic shaping.The risks of tightly coupling AI frameworks to storageWhen AI frameworks connect directly to storage endpoints without an intermediate delivery layer, operational fragility compounds quickly during scaling events, failures, and cloud transitions, which can have major consequences.\"Any instability in the storage service now has an uncontained blast radius,\" Menger says. \"Anything here becomes a system failure, not a storage failure. Or frankly, aberrant behavior in one application can have knock-on effects to all consumers of that storage service.\"Menger describes a pattern he&#x27;s seen with three different customers, where tight coupling cascaded into complete system failures. \"We see large training or fine-tuning workloads overwhelm the storage infrastructure, and the storage infrastructure goes down,\" he explains. \"At that scale, the recovery is never measured in seconds. Minutes if you&#x27;re lucky. Usually hours. The GPUs are now not being fed. They&#x27;re starved for data. These high value resources, for that entire time the system is down, are negative ROI.\"How an independent data delivery layer improves GPU utilization and stabilityThe financial impact of introducing an independent data delivery layer extends beyond preventing catastrophic failures. Decoupling allows data access to be optimized independently of storage hardware, improving GPU utilization by reducing idle time and contention while improving cost predictability and system performance as scale increases, Stringfellow says. \"It enables intelligent caching, traffic shaping, and protocol optimization closer to compute, which lowers cloud egress and storage amplification costs,\" she explains. \"Operationally, this isolation protects storage systems from unbounded AI access patterns, resulting in more predictable cost behavior and stable performance under growth and variability.\"Using a programmable control point between compute and storageF5&#x27;s answer is to position its Application Delivery and Security Platform, powered by BIG-IP, as a \"storage front door\" that provides health-aware routing, hotspot avoidance, policy enforcement, and security controls without requiring application rewrites.\"Introducing a delivery tier in between compute and storage helps define boundaries of accountability,\" Menger says. \"Compute is about execution. Storage is about durability. Delivery is about reliability.\" The programmable control point, which uses event-based, conditional logic rather than generative AI, enables intelligent traffic management that goes beyond simple load balancing. Routing decisions are based on real backend health, using intelligent health awareness to detect early signs of trouble. This includes monitoring leading indicators of trouble. And when problems emerge, the system can isolate misbehaving components without taking down the entire service. \"An independent, programmable data delivery layer becomes necessary because it allows policy, optimization, security, and traffic control to be applied uniformly across both ingestion and consumption paths without modifying storage systems or AI frameworks,\" Stringfellow says. \"By decoupling data access from storage implementation, organizations can safely absorb bursty writes, optimize reads, and protect backend systems from unbounded AI access patterns.\"Handling security issues in AI data deliveryAI isn&#x27;t just pushing storage teams on throughput, it&#x27;s forcing them to treat data movement as both a performance and security problem, Stringfellow says. Security can no longer be assumed simply because data sits deep in the data center. AI introduces automated, high-volume access patterns that must be authenticated, encrypted, and governed at speed. That&#x27;s where F5 BIG-IP comes into play.\"F5 BIG-IP sits directly in the AI data path to deliver high-throughput access to object storage while enforcing policy, inspecting traffic, and making payload-informed traffic management decisions,\" Stringfellow says. \"Feeding GPUs quickly is necessary, but not sufficient; storage teams now need confidence that AI data flows are optimized, controlled, and secure.\"Why data delivery will define AI scalabilityLooking ahead, the requirements for data delivery will only intensify, Stringfellow says. \"AI data delivery will shift from bulk optimization toward real-time, policy-driven data orchestration across distributed systems,\" she says. \"Agentic and RAG-based architectures will require fine-grained runtime control over latency, access scope, and delegated trust boundaries. Enterprises should start treating data delivery as programmable infrastructure, not a byproduct of storage or networking. The organizations that do this early will scale faster and with less risk.\"Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

          "content": "Presented by F5As enterprises pour billions into GPU infrastructure for AI workloads, many are discovering that their expensive compute resources sit idle far more than expected. The culprit isn&#x27;t the hardware. It’s the often-invisible data delivery layer between storage and compute that&#x27;s starving GPUs of the information they need.\"While people are focusing their attention, justifiably so, on GPUs, because they&#x27;re very significant investments, those are rarely the limiting factor,\" says Mark Menger, solutions architect at F5. \"They&#x27;re capable of more work. They&#x27;re waiting on data.\"AI performance increasingly depends on an independent, programmable control point between AI frameworks and object storage — one that most enterprises haven’t deliberately architected. As AI workloads scale, bottlenecks and instability happens when AI frameworks are tightly coupled to specific storage endpoints during scaling events, failures, and cloud transitions.\"Traditional storage access patterns were not designed for highly parallel, bursty, multi-consumer AI workloads,\" says Maggie Stringfellow, VP, product management - BIG-IP. \"Efficient AI data movement requires a distinct data delivery layer designed to abstract, optimize, and secure data flows independently of storage systems, because GPU economics make inefficiency immediately visible and expensive.\"Why AI workloads overwhelm object storageThese bidirectional patterns include massive ingestion from continuous data capture, simulation output, and model checkpoints. Combined with read-intensive training and inference workloads, they stress the tightly coupled infrastructure upon which the storage systems are reliant.While storage vendors have done significant work in scaling the data throughput into and out of their systems, that focus on throughput alone creates knock-on effects across the switching, traffic management, and security layers coupled to storage.The stress on S3-compatible systems from AI workloads is multidimensional and differs significantly from traditional application patterns. It&#x27;s less about raw throughput and more about concurrency, metadata pressure, and fan-out considerations. Training and fine-tuning create particularly challenging patterns, like massive parallel reads of small to mid-size objects. These workloads also involve repeated passes through training data across epochs and periodic checkpoint write bursts.RAG workloads introduce their own complexity through request amplification.

How do you enable them to truly think together, with all the contextual understanding, negotiation, and shared purpose that entails? It&#x27;s a critical next step toward a new kind of distributed intelligence that keeps humans firmly in the loop.At the latest stop on VentureBeat&#x27;s AI Impact Series, Vijoy Pandey, SVP and GM of Outshift by Cisco, and Noah Goodman, Stanford professor and co-founder of Humans&, sat down to talk about how to move beyond agents that just connect to agents that are steeped in collective intelligence.The need for collective intelligence, not coordinated actionsThe core challenge, Pandey said, is that \"agents today can connect together, but they can&#x27;t really think together.\" While protocols like MCP and A2A have solved basic connectivity, and AGNTCY tackles the problems of discovery, identity management to inter-agent communication and observability, they&#x27;ve only addressed the equivalent of making a phone call between two people who don&#x27;t speak the same language. But Pandey&#x27;s team has identified something deeper than technical plumbing: the need for agents to achieve collective intelligence, not just coordinated actions.How shared intent and shared knowledge enable collective innovation To understand where multi-agent AI needs to go, both speakers pointed to the history of human intelligence. While humans became individually intelligent roughly 300,000 years ago, true collective intelligence didn&#x27;t emerge until around 70,000 years ago with the advent of sophisticated language.This breakthrough enabled three critical capabilities: shared intent, shared knowledge, and collective innovation. \"Once you have a shared intent, a shared goal, you have a body of knowledge that you can modify, evolve, build upon, you can then go towards collective innovation,\" Pandey said.Goodman, whose work bridges computer science and psychology, explained that language is far more than just encoding and decoding information. \"Language is this kind of encoding that requires understanding the context, the intention of the speaker, the world, how that affects what people will say in order to figure out what people mean,\" he said. This sophisticated understanding is what scaffolds human collaboration and cumulative cultural evolution, and it&#x27;s what is currently missing from agent-to-agent interaction.Addressing the gaps with the Internet of Cognition \"We have to mimic human evolution,” Pandey explained. “In addition to agents getting smarter and smarter, just like individual humans, we need to build infrastructure that enables collective innovation, which implies sharing intent, coordination, and then sharing knowledge or context and evolving that context.”Pandey calls it the Internet of Cognition: a three-layer architecture designed to enable collective thinking among heterogeneous agents:Protocol layer: Beyond basic connectivity, these protocols enable understanding, handling intent sharing, coordination, negotiation, and discovery between agents from different vendors and organizations.Fabric layer: A shared memory system that allows agents to build and evolve collective context, with emergent properties arising from their interactions.Cognition engine layer: Accelerators and guardrails that help agents think faster while operating within necessary constraints around compliance, security, and cost.The difficulty is that organizations need to build collective intelligence across organizational boundaries.\"Think about shared memory in a heterogeneous way,\" Pandey said. \"We have agents from different parties coming together. So how do you evolve that memory and have emergent properties?\" New foundation training protocols to advance agent connectionAt Humans&, rather than relying solely on additional protocols, Goodman’s team is fundamentally changing how foundation models are trained not only between a human and an agent, but between a human and multiple agents, and especially between an agent and multiple humans. \"By changing the training that we give to the foundation models and centering the training over extremely long horizon interactions, they&#x27;ll come to understand how interactions should proceed in order to achieve the right long-term outcomes,\" he said. And, he adds, it&#x27;s a deliberate divergence from the longer-autonomy path pursued by many large labs.\"Our goal is not longer and longer autonomy. It&#x27;s better and better collaboration,\" he said. \"Humans& is building agents with deep social understanding: entities that know who knows what, can foster collaboration, and put the right specialists in touch at the right time.\"Establishing guardrails that support cognitionGuardrails remain a central challenge in deploying multi-functional agents that touch every part of an organization&#x27;s system. The question is how to enforce boundaries without stifling innovation. Organizations need strict, rule-like guardrails, but humans don&#x27;t actually work that way. Instead, people operate on a principle of minimal harm, or thinking ahead about consequences and making contextual judgments.\"How do we provide the guardrails in a way which is rule-like, but also supports the outcome-based cognition when the models get smart enough for that?\" Goodman asked.Pandey extended this thinking to the reality of innovation teams that need to apply the rules with judgment, not just follow them mechanically. Figuring out what’s open to interpretation is a “very collaborative task,” he said. “And you don&#x27;t figure that out through a set of predicates. You don&#x27;t figure that out through a document. You figure that out through common understanding and grounding and discovery and negotiation.\"Distributed intelligence: the path to superintelligenceTrue superintelligence won&#x27;t come from increasingly powerful individual models, but from distributed systems. \"While we build better and better models, and better and better agents, eventually we feel that true super intelligence will happen through distributed systems,\" Pandey saidIntelligence will scale along two axes, both vertical, or better individual agents, and horizontal, or more collaborative networks, in a manner very similar to traditional distributed computing.However, said Goodman, \"We can&#x27;t move towards a future where the AIs go off and work by themselves. We have to move towards a future where there&#x27;s an integrated ecosystem, a distributed ecosystem that seamlessly merges humans and AI together.\"",

Let's focus on the bulk first. The Ayaneo Next II weighs in at a truly wrist-straining 3.14 pounds, making it more than twice as heavy in the hands as the Steam Deck OLED (not to mention 2022's original Ayaneo Next, which weighed a much more reasonable 1.58 pounds). The absolute unit also measures 13.45 inches wide and 10.3 inches tall, according to Ayaneo's spec sheet, giving it a footprint approximately 60 percent larger than the Switch 2 (with Joy-Cons attached). Ayaneo packs some seriously powerful portable PC performance into all that bulk, though. The high-end version of the system sports a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chipset with 16 Zen5 cores alongside a Radeon 8060S with 40 RDNA3.5 compute units. That should give this massive portable performance comparable to a desktop with an RTX 4060 or a gaming laptop like last year's high-end ROG Flow Z13.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Google continues to turn the screws on free YouTube users, expanding a test that restricts access to song lyrics on YouTube Music. Users without a premium subscription have found that Google's streaming music service only shows song lyrics a few times before demanding money. For as long as YouTube Music has existed, lyrics have been accessible to all users in the mobile app. That started to change over recent months as Google tested a paywall. The lyrics section still appears in the app when playing a song with a free account, but opening it eats into a limited allotment of lyric views. A substantial uptick in user reports, spotted by 9to5Google, suggests this restriction is now rolling out widely. \"You have [x] views remaining,\" the app now warns free users who access lyrics. It looks like users get five free lyric views before they have to pay up. Google has still neglected to officially announce the addition of this feature to its Premium subscription—there's no mention of lyrics being part of the paid tier on Google's support page.Read full article Comments",

This is government intimidation, not a legitimate investigation,\" Gomez said in a statement Friday night. \"Like many other so-called ‘investigations’ before it, the FCC will announce an investigation but never carry one out, reach a conclusion, or take any meaningful action. The real purpose is to weaponize the FCC’s regulatory authority to intimidate perceived critics of this administration and chill protected speech.\" The FCC hasn't announced the investigation but previously gave several indications that it would occur sooner or later. After pressuring ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said in September that it would be \"worthwhile to have the FCC look into whether The View and some of these other programs\" are violating the agency's equal-time rule. The Carr FCC followed that up in January by issuing a warning to late-night and daytime talk shows that they may no longer qualify for the bona fide news exemption to the equal-time rule.Read full article Comments",

Although government IDs will be checked off-device, the selfie data will never leave the user's device, Discord emphasized. Both forms of data will be promptly deleted after the user's age is estimated.

The MAHA Institute, which was set up to advocate for some of the most profoundly unscientific ideas of our time, hosted leaders of the best-funded scientific organization on the planet, the National Institutes of Health. Instead of a hostile reception, however, Jay Bhattacharya, the head of the NIH, was greeted as a hero by the audience, receiving a partial standing ovation when he rose to speak. Over the ensuing five hours, the NIH leadership and MAHA Institute moderators found many areas of common ground: anger over pandemic-era decisions, a focus on the failures of the health care system, the idea that we might eat our way out of some health issues, the sense that science had lost people's trust, and so on. And Bhattacharya and others clearly shaped their messages to resonate with their audience. The reason? MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) is likely to be one of the only political constituencies supporting Bhattacharya's main project, which he called a \"second scientific revolution.\"Read full article Comments",

Per the (deliberately vague) official premise: \"If you found out we weren’t alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to 7 billion people. We are coming close to… Disclosure Day.\" The trailer doesn't tell us much more than the logline. It opens with a newscast announcing the pending public release of \"government material long shrouded in secrecy.\" We see a shot of a man standing in the middle of a crop circle that definitely wasn't made by humans. A little girl encounters a seemingly sentient deer in her bedroom as a voiceover wonders whether there could be \"others.\" And what's with putting electrodes on people's temples so that their eyes change color?

The Italian sports and racing car maker is taking a careful approach to revealing details about its first battery EV, signaling a depth of thought that goes well beyond simply swapping a V12, transmission, and fuel tank out for batteries and electric motors. Indeed, the interior of the new car—called the Ferrari Luce—bears little family resemblance to any recent Ferrari. Instead, LoveFrom appears to have channeled Ferrari interiors from the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, with a retro simplicity that combines clear round gauges with brushed aluminum. Forget the capacitive panels that so frustrated me in the Ferrari 296—here, there are physical buttons and rocker switches that seem free of the crash protection surrounds that Mini was forced to use. The steering wheel now resembles the iconic \"Nardi\" wheel that has graced so many older Ferraris. But here, the horn buttons have been integrated into the spokes, and multifunction pods hang off the horizontal spokes, allowing Ferrari to keep its \"hands on the wheel\" approach to ergonomics. Made from entirely CNC-milled recycled aluminum, the Luce's wheel weighs 400 g less than Ferrari's usual steering wheel.Read full article Comments",

But for the non-sports minded, Amazon MGM Studios has released one last trailer for its forthcoming space odyssey Project Hail Mary, based on Andy Weir’s (The Martian) bestselling 2021 novel about an amnesiac biologist-turned-schoolteacher in space. As previously reported, Amazon MGM Studios acquired the rights for Weir’s novel before it was even published and brought on Drew Goddard to write the screenplay. (Goddard also wrote the adapted screenplay for The Martian, so he’s an excellent choice.) The studio tapped Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The LEGO Movie) to direct and signed on Ryan Gosling to star. Per the official premise: Science teacher Ryland Grace (Ryan Gosling) wakes up on a spaceship light years from home with no recollection of who he is or how he got there. As his memory returns, he begins to uncover his mission: solve the riddle of the mysterious substance causing the sun to die out. He must call on his scientific knowledge and unorthodox ideas to save everything on Earth from extinction… but an unexpected friendship means he may not have to do it alone. In addition to Gosling, the cast includes Sandra Huller as head of the Hail Mary project and Ryland’s superior; Milana Vayntrub as project astronaut Olesya Ilyukhina; Ken Leung as project astronaut Yao Li-Jie; Liz Kingsman as Shapiro; Orion Lee as Xi; and James Ortiz as a new life form Ryland names Rocky.Read full article Comments",
