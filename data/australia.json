Kyra Anstas was nearby and rushed to help, holding the hand of one workers who asked her to call his father.\"I tried really hard to stay calm for him and for his dad and let him know he was pretty hurt but he was OK,\" she told 9News.CCTV images show the maroon Honda turning right into Lock Street, clipping the white Toyota, which was travelling along Bungarribee Road.It&#x27;s unclear what colour the traffic lights were.Aerial vision from the crash scene showed the white Toyota flipped on its side and a tree knocked over.

Blacktown Police Area Command Superintendent Brendan Gorman told reporters that speed and the traffic control signals at the intersection will form part of the investigation.Firefighters have cleared the branches and debris on the crash site and have rendered the site safe.
