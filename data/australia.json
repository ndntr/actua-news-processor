There needs to be more informed support for the victims ... this isn&#x27;t a once-off, it is still happening.\"The class action has been filed by Australian law firm JGA Saddler, backed by global litigation funder Omni Bridgeway.The legal case is a demand for action, accountability and real change as sexual violence and discrimination continue to plague female ADF members, JGA Saddler lawyer Josh Aylward said.\"The threat of war often isn&#x27;t the biggest safety fear for female ADF personnel, it is the threat of sexual violence in their workplace,\" he said.\"They have signed up to defend their country, not to fight off fellow ADF personnel on a daily basis, all while simply trying to do their job.\"Aylward noted these were not historical cases, and some incidents had occurred within the last 12 months.READ MORE: &#x27;Kill crew&#x27; trio charged with murdering alleged drug syndicate member&#x27;s wife\"The ADF has done very little to protect those who protect us,\" he said.In a statement, a Defence spokesperson said the ADF was developing a comprehensive sexual misconduct prevention strategy.\"Defence acknowledges there is work to be done and that is why the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, which relate to sexual violence, are being implemented as a priority,\" the spokesperson said.\"All Defence personnel have a right to be respected and deserve to have a positive workplace experience in the ADF.\"There is no place for sexual violence or misconduct in Defence.\"Defence Minister Richard Marles was contacted for comment.Support is available from the National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service at 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732).DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
