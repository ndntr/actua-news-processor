The family has cooperated fully with the investigation and want nothing more than to find Gus and reunite him with his mum and dad.\"The lawyers also indicated Josie and Shannon Murray will not be making any further comments.There is no suggestion Josie or Shannon Murray are involved in the disappearance of Gus and it is not unusual for anyone linked to an investigation to seek out legal advice.Police yesterday said a person who has close ties to the household, who is not one of his parents, was speaking with detectives but then \"withdrew co-operation\" and is now considered a suspect. No arrests have been made. Detective Superintendent Darren Fielke also revealed the investigation had centred on three theories: whether Gus was abducted; whether someone he knows was involved in his disappearance or suspected death; and whether he wandered off from Oak Park Station.Fielke said detectives from Taskforce Horizon have a \"high level of confidence\" he did not wander off.Investigators have also found no evidence to suggest Gus was abducted.The search for Gus No evidence of Gus has been uncovered despite extensive searches of the property, which Fielke said has been the \"largest and most intensive\" missing person search ever undertaken by SA Police.A full-scale ground and air search of the property and the surrounding area was launched after Gus went missing. Officers returned to the area surrounding Oak Park Station to search for Gus&#x27; remains on February 2, but uncovered no evidence.
