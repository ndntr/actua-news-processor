Apollo, 65, sits in a wheelchair as he recovers from a stroke, his frail frame outlined against the translucent plastic walls of the tent. Judy, in a wrinkled T-shirt and shorts, holds a bowl beneath the spoon as she feeds him.She looks tired but unhurried, her movements deliberate, tender — the kind that comes from a lifetime spent caring for each other.READ MORE: Radio icon John Laws dies aged 90They had left their creekside home on Saturday, afraid it would flood again as Super Typhoon Fung-wong loomed. Their house was inundated during heavy rains in October. And when radio and television warnings urged residents to move to higher ground ahead of the storm, they didn&#x27;t wait.Inside the basketball court, dozens of families occupy rows of bright tents. The wind howls outside. Inside, the hum of quiet conversations drifts from tent to tent, punctuated by the loud play and chatter of children.Amid the noise and the uncertainty, Judy steadies the spoon again, her hand trembling slightly as she feeds Apollo, as if to say: The storm may rage beyond these walls, but care endures here.Fung-wong makes landfall, forces 1 million to evacuateFung-wong, biggest typhoon to threaten the Philippines in years, slammed ashore on Sunday (early Monday AEDT) on the north-eastern coast of the Philippines, where the massive storm had already left at least two people dead and forced more than a million people to evacuate from flood- and landslide-prone areas, officials said.The typhoon blew into Dinalungan town in Aurora province Sunday night after setting off fierce rain and wind in northeastern Philippine provinces all day from offshore, with sustained winds of up to 185 km/h and gusts of up to 230 km/h.READ MORE: Man found dead on track after massive brawlFung-wong could cover two-thirds of the archipelago with its 1800-kilometre-wide rain and wind band, forecasters said. It approached from the Pacific while the Philippines was still dealing with the devastation wrought by Typhoon Kalmaegi, which left at least 224 people dead in central provinces on Tuesday before pummelling Vietnam, where at least five were killed.A villager drowned in flash floods in the eastern province of Catanduanes and another died in Catbalogan city in eastern Samar province when she was pinned by debris, officials said.Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos jnr has declared a state of emergency due to the extensive devastation caused by Kalmaegi and the expected calamity from Fung-wong, which is also called Uwan in the Philippines.Tropical cyclones with sustained winds of 185 km/h or higher are categorised in the Philippines as a super typhoon, a designation adopted years ago to underscore the urgency tied to more extreme weather disturbances.READ MORE: Senator says he&#x27;ll quit if Liberals dump net zero&#x27;Zero visibility&#x27; \"The rain and wind were so strong there was nearly zero visibility,\" Roberto Monterola, a disaster-mitigation officer for Catanduanes, told The Associated Press by telephone.Despite calls for residents to evacuate Saturday, some still stayed on.\"Our personnel rescued 14 people who were trapped on the roof of a house engulfed in flood in a low-lying neighbourhood,\" Monterola said. \"A father also called in panic, saying the roof of his house was about to be ripped off by the wind. We saved him and four relatives.\"More than a million people were moved away from high-risk villages in northeastern provinces, including in Bicol, a coastal region vulnerable to Pacific cyclones and mudflows from Mayon, one of the country&#x27;s most active volcanoes.Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro jnr warned about the potentially catastrophic impact of Fung-wong in televised remarks Saturday. He said the storm could affect a vast expanse of the country, including Cebu, the central province hit hardest by the previous typhoon, and metropolitan Manila, the densely populated capital region.More than 30 million people could be exposed to hazards posed by Fung-wong, the Office of Civil Defence said.Teodoro asked people to follow government orders and seek shelter away from villages and towns prone to flash floods, landslides and coastal tidal surges. \"We need to do this because when it&#x27;s already raining or the typhoon has hit and flooding has started, it&#x27;s hard to rescue people,\" Teodoro said.Power cut in eastern towns The Philippines has not called for international help following the devastation caused by Kalmaegi, but Teodoro said the US, the country&#x27;s longtime treaty ally, and Japan were ready to provide assistance.As Fung-wong approached with its wide band of fierce wind and rain, several eastern towns and villages lost power, Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro, deputy administrator of the Office of Civil Defence said.Authorities in northern provinces that could be hit or sideswiped by Fung-wong preemptively shut schools and most government offices on Monday and Tuesday. At least 325 domestic and 61 international flights have been cancelled over the weekend and into Monday, and more than 6600 commuters and cargo workers were stranded in seaports, where the coast guard prohibited ships from venturing into rough seas.Authorities warned of a \"high risk of life-threatening and damaging storm surge\" of more than three metres along the coasts of more than 20 provinces and regions, including metropolitan Manila.The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons and storms each year. The country also is often hit by earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the world&#x27;s most disaster-prone countries.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

He grew up in Sydney after being evacuated to Australia during World War II.In 1953, at 18, Laws hitchhiked to central Victoria where he took a job as a general hand at local Bendigo radio station 3BO.His first job included making tea for staff and packing away the sixteen-inch records. He made his on-air debut reading a commercial for a local haberdashery store, The Beehive.READ MORE: Single gunshot heard from bush after Dezi Freeman&#x27;s escapeIn 1956 he returned to the big smoke to work at Sydney station 2UE. He worked alongside the likes of the late Australian media icon Brian Henderson.During his time at the station, Laws was one of the first DJs to present Australia&#x27;s first top 40 Countdown.As part of the broadcast line-up, Laws met and became friends with the likes of Roy Orbison, Willie Nelson, Tom Jones, Nat King Cole, Johnny O&#x27;Keefe and Col Joye and the Joy Boys.During this period Laws also embraced the industry&#x27;s new talkback format, which would make him a household name as would his \"Hello world\" phrase.He was considered so highly influential that the 1983 Australian Federal Election was dubbed \"The John Laws Election\" for the amount of campaign announcements made on Laws&#x27; show.In 1984, after a bidding war for his services, he joined 2GB. Four years later he returned to 2UE.Laws&#x27; political influence would be on display again in 1993 when former Prime Minister Paul Keating attended a dinner to mark Laws&#x27; 40th year in radio.At the dinner, Keating called Laws the \"broadcaster of the century\".At the height of his career, Laws was caught in a \"cash for comment\" scandal.An investigation by the Australian Broadcasting Authority found he breached commercial radio broadcast codes.The saga fuelled an outrage with Laws plastered on the front page of the mainstream newspapers for seven days in a row. He said he couldn&#x27;t leave his home without being hounded by the media.\"It was hideous. I survived it with difficulty. But I survived it because that&#x27;s my intention all the time, to survive,\" he said in a 2000 interview with The Age.He denied any suggestion of secret payments and that 2UE were aware of the financial agreements.By 2007, a 71-year-old Laws retired from radio, ending his 55-year career. He returned to the airwaves in 2011.When he made the announcement during his show then Prime Minister John Howard and future prime minister Kevin Rudd were among his callers.In early February 2020 Laws farewelled his \"Princess\" and wife, Caroline, who lost her battle with cancer after 43 years of marriage.In 2021, 85-year-old Laws suffered a health scare after he was admitted to a Sydney hospital with an infection.Laws retired in 2024 after 71 years in radio, saying he&#x27;d had a \"fantastic\" time in the industry and didn&#x27;t \"want to be greedy\".\"I think it&#x27;s time for a rest, is what I think,\" Laws announced on his 2SM radio show.\"I&#x27;ve done it for a very, very, very, very long time - 70 years, is it long enough? It&#x27;s long enough.\"At the time, Laws said his plans for retirement were to read more and travel. Laws was said to be in \"good form\" when he returned from a European holiday in September.\"He spent two weeks in hospital last month and was then cared for at his home at Woolloomooloo, where he died peacefully, yesterday,\" a statement said.Laws would always end his radio programs with his signature sign-off: \"be kind to each other.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
