He said last week Iran was \"seriously talking,\" while Tehran&#x27;s top security official, Ali Larijani, said arrangements for negotiations were under way.The US military&#x27;s Central Command said in another incident on Tuesday, hours later in the Strait of Hormuz, Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces harassed a US-flagged, US-crewed merchant vessel.\"Two IRGC boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached M/V Stena Imperative at high speeds and threatened to board and seize the tanker,\" Hawkins said.

There is an extreme fire danger warning and a total fire ban in place for tomorrow with winds set to increase across the Mount Lofty Ranges, which includes the fire ground on the Fleurieu Peninsula.READ MORE: Scorching heat and high winds trigger extreme fire danger warnings&#x27;You could see red across the hill&#x27;The skies above Deep Creek were a crimson red on Monday night, prompting some residents to start packing their bags.\"You could see red across the hill, so Deep Creek was burning. I knew it was at Silverton,\" one resident told 9News.By late yesterday, those who remained were told it was too late to leave.\"We slept in our cars last night at Cape Jervis then went back to check our houses were there, which they were, and then had to vacate again,\" Darren Rigg told 9News.Fire crews worked through the night to defend homes, businesses and livestock and their efforts persisted throughout yesterday.The Country Fire Service (CFS) is yet to confirm if any homes have been lost but 9News understands a business has been impacted. \"This fire is not going away,\" CFS Chief Officer Brett Loughlin said.\"It&#x27;s going to continue to be a challenge for us.\"The local community has been rallying, with holiday park owner Ben Taylor offering up his own backyard for all those needing shelter.\"For as long as needs be, until they get it all under control and people can safely go back to their homes and stuff like that they&#x27;re all welcome, that&#x27;s fine,\" Taylor told 9News.The impact and intensity of the blaze has been far reaching, with Kangaroo Island ferry services halted on Monday night.They resumed Tuesday afternoon but only for essential freight and emergency services.Main South Road is still closed westbound between Delamere and Cape Jervis, with limited access for those travelling east.\"Whilst there is still active fire coming up onto the roadside and we have strike teams of firefighters diligently working there, it is not a safe environment and that road is going to remain closed for an extended period of time,\" Loughlin said.While the threat has reduced for now, authorities say fire crews have an enormous task ahead of them.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

          "content": "Australia&#x27;s big four banks have all moved to pass on the Reserve Bank of Australia&#x27;s interest rate hike.The official cash rate was today increased by 25 basis points to 3.85 per cent, the first hike in two years.Westpac was the first to announce that it would raise its variable interest home loan rates by 0.25 per cent but the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and ANZ quickly followed suit.AS IT HAPPENED: Reserve Bank announces rate hike Westpac&#x27;s changes will take effect from February 17 while the other banks will shift on the 13th.Today&#x27;s hike will add around $100 to an average mortgage holder&#x27;s monthly repayments, although many borrowers have a buffer built up thanks to last year&#x27;s three cuts.The central bank&#x27;s updated economic forecasts didn&#x27;t bode well for borrowers, with inflation not predicted to come back into the 2 to 3 per cent target band until June 2027, and core inflation not tipped to reach the middle of that range for a further year.But Governor Michele Bullock seemed genuinely unsure about what her bank&#x27;s next move will be.\"It is not the same as the tightening cycle when we were coming out of COVID, when we were coming from 0.1 per cent cash rate; it was quite clear that we had to go up and we had to go up quickly,\" she said.\"This isn&#x27;t as clear.\" CBA&#x27;s economists expect another hike in May, taking the cash rate to 4.1 per cent, because there&#x27;s unlikely to be enough evidence by then to show today&#x27;s hike is slowing demand. \"Inflation is simply too high for the RBA at this stage, and the central bank has signalled a stronger resolve to bring it back within target,\" Commonwealth Bank head of Australian economics Belinda Allen said.NAB chief economist Sally Auld suspected this was unlikely to be a \"one-and-done\" scenario for the RBA.Financial comparison site Canstar also warned homeowners to prepare for the possibility of future rate hikes while noting the banks&#x27; silence on savings.\"None of the big four banks have said anything about savings rates – creating an unfortunate waiting game that keeps loyal savers in the dark,\" data insights director Sally Tindall said.\"A climbing cash rate can be good news for steadfast savers, but know that banks often hand-pick which rates go up and which ones miss out.\"Investors ramped up bets for a follow-up hike in May, which is now priced about 75 per cent. Markets expect an additional total tightening of 40 basis points this year.The RBA joins the Bank of Japan as the only other developed-world central bank tightening policy at the moment. Markets are still priced for rate cuts in the US, UK and Canada, while the European Central Bank is widely expected to be on an extended pause.Markets had wagered on a 78 per cent probability of a hike given inflation surprised on the high side in the fourth quarter, while unemployment hit a seven-month low in December.The Australian dollar extended earlier gains to be up 0.9 per cent to $US0.7002 while three-year government bond yields jumped 8 basis points to 4.3 per cent.The RBA did not raise interest rates as aggressively as its international peers when inflation was running hot due to its desire to preserve gains in the labour market.That approach may yet test policymakers. The central bank&#x27;s three rate cuts last year saw inflation rear its head again, forcing it to pivot towards a hawkish stance late in 2025 and prompting market bets of an earlier-than-expected start to the tightening cycle.- reported with Reuters NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
