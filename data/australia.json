          "content": "P rime Minister Anthony Albanese has said Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei \"will not be mourned\" as he doubled down on Australia&#x27;s support for the US to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.Speaking at a press conference earlier today, Alabese said Australia \"stands with the brave people of Iran in their struggle against what is an oppressive regime\".\"I understand this is a very difficult time for the tens of thousands of Australians with loved ones in the Middle East. The days ahead are going to be difficult. They are uncertain,\" Albanese said.LIVE UPDATES: US launches &#x27;major combat operations in Iran&#x27;He said he believed it was key for global stability that Iran did not obtain a nuclear weapon. \"We support the [United] States acting to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and to prevent Iran from continuing to threaten international peace security,\" he said.He said Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei \"was responsible for orchestrating attacks on Australian soil\".\"His passing will not be mourned,\" he said.In a statement released yesterday, just hours after the strikes began, Albanese slammed the \"brutal acts of violence and intimidation\" the regime uses, including targeted attacks in Australia.Albanese said he supported the United States \"acting to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and to prevent Iran continuing to threaten international peace and security,\" though did not directly mention the strikes.\"The regime has instigated a brutal crackdown on its own people, leaving thousands of Iranian civilians dead. A regime that relies on the repression and murder of its own people to retain power is without legitimacy,\" he said.Referencing two attacks on Jewish synagogues in Australia in 2024, Albanese said: \" These appalling acts targeting Australia&#x27;s Jewish community were intended to create fear, divide our society and challenge our sovereignty.\"EXPLAINED: Trump went from &#x27;not happy&#x27; to bombing Iran in hours - here&#x27;s whyAs a result of the attacks, Australia expelled Iran&#x27;s ambassador and listed the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation.Albanese said Iran has been a \"destabilising force\" through its ballistic missile and nuclear program.WATCH: Trump tells Iranian officials to lay down arms or &#x27;face death&#x27;He said it was a \"threat to world peace\". \"The international community has been clear that the Iranian regime can never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon,\" Albanese added.\"Australia stands with the brave people of Iran in their struggle against oppression.\"Opposition leader Angus Taylor called Iran&#x27;s regime \"authoritarian, antisemitic and abhorrent.\"\"It wants nuclear weapons, seeks the destruction of Israel, has encouraged terrorism through its proxies - Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis - and has supplied weapons to Russia to support Putin&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine,\" he said in a post on X.\"We pray for the Iranian people at this time.\"NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
