The reward is the largest ever offered in the state .Detective Inspector Dean Thomas said that he remains open to all possibilities in regards to the whereabouts of Freeman, seeing this bounty as \"just another avenue\" in the hunt.READ MORE: Teen girl fighting for life after being attacked by friend&#x27;s dog identified Thomas described the reward as a \"life-changing amount of money for anyone\".\"While the offering of a reward for a murder investigation is not unusual in itself, what sets this apart is that this reward is for arrest and not conviction – and it is the largest reward ever offered for an arrest in Victoria,\" he said.\"This figure recognises the seriousness of this violent offending and our commitment to locating Freeman as soon as possible so that he is no longer a risk to the broader community.\"Our aim in offering this reward is that it will lead someone out there, who may not have been willing to come forward until this time, to contact police.\"READ MORE: Proposed Elon Musk pay package could make him the world&#x27;s first trillionaire The record bounty comes as police enter their day 12 in their search for the alleged killer.Despite hundreds of tip-offs, there have been no confirmed sightings. Freeman is believed to be heavily armed as police continue to search over 100 properties and acres of bushland.Police have previously stated that they believe some people might know his whereabouts or are potentially harbouring the alleged killer. READ MORE: Surfer killed by a shark at popular Sydney beach \"This could be sightings of Freeman, information you&#x27;re hearing in your local communities, even suspicious activity on your property – whatever it is, we want you to tell us,\" Thomas said.\"I would also like to stress to members of the public that if you see Freeman, then we need you to call triple zero immediately because this will give police the very best chance of apprehending him.\"Freeman has killed two people and injured a third, and it&#x27;s immensely important that we can bring him into custody safely as soon as possible – hopefully this reward helps do just that.\"Authorities remain open to the possibility that Freeman is still alive or could potentially be dead as a result of self-harm.They hope this reward for information leading to his arrest will be an incentive. More than 450 officers are dedicated to the search each day with \"no talk\" of reducing those numbers, Victoria Police said.
