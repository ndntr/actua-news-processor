          "content": "The FBI was on Friday searching the Maryland home and Washington office of John Bolton – who served in US President Donald Trump&#x27;s first administration as national security adviser but later became critical of the president – as part of an investigation into the handling of classified information, a person familiar with the matter said.Bolton was not detained and has not been charged with any crimes, said the person, who was not authorised to discuss the investigation by name and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.After the search at Bolton&#x27;s home started, he was spotted on Friday morning standing in the lobby of the Washington building where he keeps an office and talking to two people with \"FBI\" visible on their vests. He left a few minutes later and appeared to have gone upstairs in the building. Agents were seen taking bags into the office building through a back entrance.READ MORE: Police explode dangerous device found on popular Aussie beachhttps://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/1958847495028584529The searches appear to be the most significant public step the Justice Department has taken against a perceived enemy of the president, and they&#x27;re likely to elicit fresh criticism that the Trump administration is using its law enforcement powers to go after the Republican&#x27;s foes. They come as the Trump administration has moved to examine the activities of other critics, including by authorising a grand jury investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe that dogged Trump for much of his first term, and as FBI and Justice Department leaders signal their loyalty to the president. They also unfolded against the backdrop of a 2022 search for classified documents at Trump&#x27;s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, an action that produced since-dismissed criminal charges but remains the source of outrage for the president and supporters who insist he was unjustly targeted despite the retrieval of top-secret records. Current FBI Director Kash Patel, who included Bolton on a list of \"members of the Executive Branch Deep State\" in a 2023 book, said in a Fox News Channel interview this week that the Mar-a-Lago search represented a \"total weaponisation and politicisation\" of the bureau. Speaking to reporters during an unscheduled visit to the White House Historical Association, Trump said he had seen news coverage of Friday&#x27;s searches and expected to be briefed about it by the Justice Department but also insisted he didn&#x27;t \"want to know about it\". \"I could know about it. I could be the one starting it. I&#x27;m actually the chief law enforcement officer. But I feel that it&#x27;s better this way,\" Trump said. Bolton had said in interviews in the last few months that he was mindful that he could be scrutinised, telling the AP in January shortly before Trump took office, \"Anybody who ever disagrees with Trump has to worry about retribution. It&#x27;s a pretty long list.\"READ MORE: Tax on $4.1 trillion of Aussie savings could be rolled out soon \"It&#x27;s been a long time since people used to talk about Richard Nixon&#x27;s enemies list. But that seems to be Trump&#x27;s approach. And so it&#x27;s uncharted territory in many respects,\" Bolton said. Bolton was in his office building at the time Bolton was not home for the search of his home, but after it started, he was spotted on Friday morning standing in the lobby of the Washington building where he keeps an office and talking to two people with \"FBI\" visible on their vests. He left a few minutes later and appeared to have gone upstairs in the building. Agents were seen taking bags into the office building through a back entrance. Messages left with a spokesperson for Bolton were not immediately returned, and a lawyer who has represented Bolton had no immediate comment. The Justice Department had no comment, but leaders appeared to cryptically refer to the search of Bolton&#x27;s home in a series of social media posts on Friday morning. Patel posted on X: \"NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission.\" Attorney General Pam Bondi shared his post, adding: \"America&#x27;s safety isn&#x27;t negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always.\" The Justice Department is separately conducting mortgage fraud investigations into Democratic Senator Adam Schiff of California and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a civil fraud lawsuit against Trump and his company, and ex-Trump prosecutor Jack Smith faces an investigation from an independent watchdog office. Schiff and James have vigorously denied any wrongdoing through their lawyers.Bolton served as Trump&#x27;s third national security adviser for 17 months and clashed with him over Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea. He faced scrutiny during the first Trump administration over a book he wrote about his time in government that officials argued disclosed classified information, but the Justice Department in 2021 abandoned its lawsuit and dropped a separate grand jury investigation.Bolton&#x27;s lawyers have said he moved forward with the book after a White House National Security Council official, with whom Bolton had worked for months, said the manuscript no longer contained classified information.On his first day back in office this year, Trump revoked the security clearances of more than four dozen former intelligence officials, including Bolton. Bolton was also among a group of former Trump officials whose security details were canceled by Trump earlier this year.Bolton&#x27;s scathing book, The Room Where It Happened, portrayed Trump as grossly ill-informed about foreign policy and said he \"saw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government.\"Trump responded by slamming Bolton as a \"crazy\" war-monger who would have led the country into \"World War Six\".Bolton served as US ambassador to the United Nations under President George W Bush and also held positions in President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s administration. He had considered running for president in 2012 and 2016.In 2022, an Iranian operative was charged in a plot to kill Bolton in presumed retaliation for a January 2020 US airstrike that killed the country&#x27;s most powerful general. Bolton had by then left the Trump administration but tweeted, \"Hope this is the first step to regime change in Tehran.\"",

          "content": "Erik Menendez has been denied parole after serving decades in prison for murdering his parents with his older brother in 1989.A panel of California commissioners denied Menendez parole for three years, after which he will be eligible again, in a case that continues to fascinate the public. A parole hearing for his brother Lyle Menendez, who is being held at the same prison in San Diego, is scheduled for Friday morning local time.The two commissioners determined that Menendez should not be freed after an all-day hearing during which they questioned him about why he committed the crime and violated prison rules.READ MORE: Millions facing days of flood risk as torrential rain easesThe brothers became eligible for parole after a judge reduced their sentences in May from life without parole to 50 years to life.The parole hearings marked the closest they&#x27;ve been to winning freedom from prison since their convictions almost 30 years ago for murdering their parents.The brothers were sentenced to life in prison in 1996 for fatally shooting their father, Jose Menendez, and mother, Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989. While defence attorneys argued that the brothers acted out of self-defence after years of sexual abuse by their father, prosecutors said the brothers sought a multimillion-dollar inheritance.READ MORE: CCTV shows violent attack on one of NSW&#x27;s most notorious prisonersA judge reduced their sentences in May, and they became immediately eligible for parole.Erik Menendez made his case to two parole commissioners, offering his most detailed account in years of how he was raised, why he made the choices he did, and how he transformed in prison. He noted the hearing fell almost exactly 36 years after he killed his parents – on August 20, 1989.\"Today is August 21st. Today is the day that all of my victims learned my parents were dead. So today is the anniversary of their trauma journey,\" he said, referring to his family members.The state corrections department chose a single reporter to watch the videoconference and share details with the rest of the press.Erik Menendez&#x27;s prison recordMenendez, grey-haired and spectacled, sat in front of a computer screen wearing a blue T-shirt over a white long-sleeve shirt in a photo shared by officials.The panel of commissioners scrutinised every rules violation and fight on his lengthy prison record, including allegations that he worked with a prison gang, bought drugs, used cellphones and helped with a tax scam.He told commissioners that since he had no hope of ever getting out then, he prioritised protecting himself over following the rules. Then last fall, LA prosecutors asked a judge to resentence him and his brother – opening the door to parole.READ MORE: Great for Melbourne, bad for Sydney: The factors causing August&#x27;s strange weather\"In November of 2024, now the consequences mattered,\" Menendez said. \"Now the consequences meant I was destroying my life.\"A particular sticking point for the commissioners was his use of cellphones.\"What I got in terms of the phone and my connection with the outside world was far greater than the consequences of me getting caught with the phone,\" Menendez said.The board also brought up his earliest encounters with the law, when he committed two burglaries in high school.\"I was not raised with a moral foundation,\" he said. \"I was raised to lie, to cheat, to steal in the sense, an abstract way.\"The panel asked about details like why he used a fake ID to purchase the guns he and Lyle Menendez used to kill their parents, who acted first and why they killed their mother if their father was the main abuser.Commissioner Robert Barton asked: \"You do see that there were other choices at that point?\"\"When I look back at the person I was then and what I believed about the world and my parents, running away was inconceivable,\" Menendez said. \"Running away meant death.\"His transformation behind barsErik Menendez&#x27;s parole attorney, Heidi Rummel, emphasised 2013 as the turning point for her client.\"He found his faith. He became accountable to his higher power. He found sobriety and made a promise to his mother on her birthday,\" Rummel said. \"Has he been perfect since 2013? No. But he has been remarkable.\"Commissioner Rachel Stern also applauded him for starting a group to take care of older and disabled inmates.Since the brothers reunited, they have been \"serious accountability partners\" for each other. At the same time, he said he&#x27;s become better at setting boundaries with Lyle Menendez, and they tend to do different programming.More than a dozen of their relatives, who have advocated for the brothers&#x27; release for months, delivered emotional statements at Thursday&#x27;s hearing via videoconference.\"Seeing my crimes through my family&#x27;s eyes has been a huge part of my evolution and my growth,\" Menendez said. \"Just seeing the pain and the suffering. Understanding the magnitude of what I&#x27;ve done, the generational impact.\"His aunt Teresita Menendez-Baralt, who is Jose Menendez&#x27;s sister, said she has fully forgiven him. She noted that she is dying from stage four cancer and wishes to welcome him into her home.\"Erik carries himself with kindness, integrity and strength that comes from patience and grace,\" she said.One relative promised to the parole board that she would house him in Colorado, where he can spend time with his family and enjoying nature.The board brushed off prosecutor&#x27;s questionsLA County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said ahead of the parole hearings that he opposes parole for the brothers because of their lack of insight, comparing them to Sirhan Sirhan, who assassinated presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy in 1968. Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom denied him parole in January 2022 because of his \"deficient insight.\"During the hearing, LA prosecutor Habib Balian asked Menendez about his and his brothers&#x27; attempts to ask witnesses to lie in court on their behalf, and if the brothers staged the killings as a mafia hit. Commissioners largely dismissed the questions, saying they were not retrying the case.In closing statements, Balian questioned whether Menendez was \"truly reformed\" or saying what commissioners wanted to hear.\"When one continues to diminish their responsibility for a crime and continues to make the same false excuses that they&#x27;ve made for 30-plus years, one is still that same dangerous person that they were when they shotgunned their parents,\" Balian said.What happens nextLyle Menendez is set to appear over video conference Friday for his parole hearing from the same prison in San Diego.The case has captured the attention of true crime enthusiasts for decades and spawned documentaries, television specials and dramatizations. The Netflix drama Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story and a documentary released in 2024 have been credited for bringing new attention to the brothers.Greater recognition of the brothers as victims of sexual abuse has also helped mobilize support for their release. Some supporters have flown to Los Angeles to hold rallies and attend court hearings.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
