A watch and act warning was also issued for The Glen in the Southern Downs region about 4.20pm, where a fast-moving fire is burning near between Granite Hills Road, Pikedale Road, and Rockland Road.Firefighters have been working all afternoon to contain the blaze, which has burnt through 700 hectares since 9.30am.Residents have been warned to enact their bushfire survival plans and prepare to leave the area.Further north, a third blaze is burning through sugar cane paddocks in a rural town near Bundaberg.Firefighters have just brought the blaze, which is burning near Des Loeskow Road in Alloway, under control.A \"prepare to leave\" warning has now been downgraded to \"stay informed\" but locals are being warned to remain on high alert.In the last 24 hours firefighters say they have been battling more than 89 vegetation fires across the Sunshine State.The bushfires have cast heavy smoke across parts of the state, with authorities advising locals to stay indoors and close windows and doors.Strong winds are also believed to be hampering efforts to contain the fires. At this stage, no properties have been lost, according to the Queensland Fire Department.\"All structures are being reported as safe, we haven&#x27;t lost anything just yet, so crews are working really hard to make sure that continues,\" State fire controller Enes Seferovic said.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
