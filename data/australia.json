Baghsarian&#x27;s family are \"deeply upset\" by today&#x27;s discovery and have asked for privacy.Police will now focus efforts on identifying the offenders.\" The efforts that have gone in, and the response that has come from the public, we&#x27;re all outraged that this has happened to an innocent man,\" Marks said.\"I am proud of the police and the efforts. Police have been working 24 hours a day since Friday the 13th.\"Marks said he is confident investigators will use every resource available to bring the perpetrators to justice.WEATHER: State warned to brace for thunderstorms and flash floodingToday&#x27;s search for Baghsarian 9News understands the remains were wrapped up in what appeared to be a carpet or towel.Police searched dense bushland near Glenorie, about 15 minutes further east, yesterday.Shortly before 9am today, a number of police vehicles left that search base to travel to a patch of overgrown grassland near Pitt Town Bottoms Road.Once they arrived at the location, a blue tent - signifying the location of the remains - was raised in minutes. The overgrown piece of land is located in semi-rural surroundings, with businesses including turf farms nearby.Police on the scene this morning included tactical, general duties, and forensics officers as well as investigators.The area has been carefully combed, with officers conducting line searches around where the remains were found. The update came days after police confirmed they had found a burnt-out car in Sydney&#x27;s west that has been linked to Baghsarian&#x27;s abduction.The car, a grey 2022 Toyota Corolla with cloned plates, was found in Westmead and linked to a crime scene police had established in Dural in Sydney&#x27;s far north-west.READ MORE: Albanese backs push to remove ex-prince Andrew from line of successionPolice believe those who kidnapped Baghsarian may have taken the grandfather to the property after the abduction.During a raid, officers seized evidence, including disturbing images of the missing grandfather with his alleged kidnappers.Videos of Baghsarian have also been sent to police.MONEY: Major super shake-up set to impact more than 14 million workersThe Corolla, which had been spotted near the Dural property, was dumped and burned last Monday after 11.30pm, police said.It had cloned plates of DVT007 , and the Victorian registration 1UZ2BU.Police have said the person they believe to have been the intended target of the kidnapping is safe and in no immediate danger. The investigation continues, and anybody who has spotted any suspicious activity around Dural, or who has information or footage showing the car in question, is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or online.EXCLUSIVE: Lucy works a 9 to 5, but she makes more money trading Pokémon cardsNEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

Six-hourly rainfall totals between 40 and 70 millimetres are possible, sparking a severe weather warning for heavy rainfall across places like Echuca, Bendigo, Seymour, Mount Buller, Warragul and the Melbourne metropolitan area.BOM senior meteorologist Angus Hines said flash flooding was possible through the Melbourne metropolitan region.Melbourne&#x27;s western suburbs are particularly in danger of heavy rainfall, according to the Bureau&#x27;s current severe weather warning.Warnings for livestock safety in rural areas have also been issued. Conditions are expected to move through eastern parts of Victoria and potentially south-eastern parts of NSW tomorrow. An initial flood watch is in place for North East, Central and Gippsland catchments.The system is also expected to push into Queensland&#x27;s western Channel Country, affecting Birdsville, Eromanga, Bulloo Downs and the surrounds.There are already a number of flood warnings across the sunshine state due to recent rainfall.More rain and thunderstorms are also forecast today for much of northern and western Queensland, and there are warnings of widespread riverine flooding.The weather system is being driven by a low-pressure system bringing tropical moisture from central Australia, coupled with a cold front from the south.The low is expected to linger until at least the end of the week and possibly into next week, Hines said, though its impact on eastern Australia is expected to shift northward.Sydney will face the possibility of heavy rain from tomorrow afternoon. Emergency services are urging communities to prepare their properties before the storm by tying down loose outdoor items, clearing gutters and downpipes and parking cars undercover or away from trees.Motorists and commuters are warned to drive safely, allow extra travel time and be alert to allow extra travel time and stay alert for hazards. These hazards could include fallen trees, debris, damaged power lines and localised flash flooding.\"If severe weather is impacting your area, consider delaying travel where possible and staying indoors until conditions improve. Never drive through floodwater,\" VICSES chief officer of operations Alistair Drayton said.READ MORE: One award after another for Oscar front-runner at BAFTAsVictoria had a taste of the extreme weather on Sunday, with parts of the state battered by up to 40 millimetres of rain in the 24 hours to 9am yesterday.There was localised flash flooding in the Wodonga area, sparking 90 calls for assistance from VICSES.All up, SES volunteers responded to about 250 requests for assistance across the state between midday on Sunday and 10am yesterday.\"Thank you to the dedicated volunteers who worked throughout last night to assist impacted communities and remain ready to respond as further storms approach this week,\" Drayton said.Communities in areas recently impacted by bushfires have been warned of elevated flash flooding warnings. Burnt ground does not absorb water effectively, meaning runoff can occur quickly and without warning, the State Control Centre said.What was set to be a record-breaking dry summer across swaths of inland Australia has ended dramatically, with a torrential downpour bringing widespread flooding in the final days of summer. Before last weekend, much of inland Australia had not seen any rainfall for two to three months.An area the size of Greenland is on flood watch, from the top of the Northern Territory, into Queensland, NSW and down into agricultural regions of South Australia.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
