          "content": "US President Donald Trump is relishing in the glow of a British royal spectacle - including a carriage procession, military honour guards and flyover - as he kicked off his unprecedented second UK state visit on Wednesday, as a guest of King Charles.Trump is currently being hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle for a large state banquet including many members of the royal family and US dignitaries.The pomp and pageantry are deliberate, designed to bolster ties with Trump at a time when his America First policies are putting pressure on trade and security arrangements around the globe.IN PICTURES: The moment of Donald Trump&#x27;s UK visit cameras weren&#x27;t allowed to seeTrump, in his remarks before the lavish state dinner, said the word \"special\" hardly did justice to the relationship between the trans-Atlantic allies.He described them as two verses of the same poem, beautiful on their own but really meant to be played together. He also said they have done more good for humanity \"than any two countries in all of history\".\"The bond of kinship and identity between America and the United Kingdom is priceless and eternal,\" Trump said.\"We had a very sick country one year ago and today I believe we&#x27;re the hottest country anywhere in the world,\" the Republican president said.At this time last year, Democrat Joe Biden sat in the White House.The president was impressed at King Charles&#x27; ability to know the names of, in Trump&#x27;s estimation, about 150 people they shook hands with.\"And some of them had bad names like X, Y, Z, dash two-three,\" Trump quipped.\"And he knew every one of them. Or at least I think I did, because nobody was complaining.\"He also praised his son, Prince William as \"remarkable\" and \"amazing\" and his wife, Princess Kate, \"so radiant and so healthy, so beautiful.\"He appeared to be alluding to her cancer diagnosis. The princess said earlier this year that her cancer was in remission.Trump joked that he hoped no other American president was so honoured again.\"This is truly one of the highest honours of my life,\" Trump said, reading from prepared remarks.The king marvelled at the shared history of the two nations and their strong relationship which 250 years ago, at the time of America&#x27;s founding, would have been unimaginable to George Washington and King George.\"We celebrate a relationship between two countries that surely neither old George could possibly have imagined,\" he said.The king touched on Trump&#x27;s British roots, his recent visits to the UK and in a nod to the president&#x27;s favourite sport, said, \"I understand that British soil makes for rather splendid golf courses.\"Among those invited to the banquet hosted by King Charles III were technology CEOs Tim Cook of Apple, Demis Hassabis of Google DeepMind and Sam Altman of OpenAI. Pascal Soriot, who heads drugmaker Astrazeneca, the most valuable company on the London Stock Exchange, was also in attendance.In a nod to Trump&#x27;s love of golf, English golfer Nick Faldo, winner of six major championships, including three Masters&#x27; titles, was also present.The king is sitting next to Trump at the center of the 50-metre long table in St George&#x27;s Hall, where the ceiling is adorned with the coat of arms of every Knight of the Garter since the order was founded in 1348. Catherine, the Princess of Wales, is seated to the president&#x27;s right.On the other side of the table, Queen Camilla is seated next to first lady Melania Trump and Treasury chief Scott Bessent. Media mogul Rupert Murdoch also has a seat at the table.Records set in unprecedented visit For the grandeur-loving president, festivities involved 120 horses and 1300 troops - including the largest guard of honour in living memory.No US president, or any other world leader, has ever had the honour of a second UK state visit.Trump&#x27;s visit began with Prince William and his wife, Catherine, Princess of Wales meeting presidential helicopter Marine One in the private Walled Garden on the vast Windsor estate.The royal couple then walking the president and first lady Melania Trump over to be greeted by the King and Queen Camilla, who looked to have recovered from a bout of acute sinusitis which saw her drop out of the Duchess of Kent&#x27;s funeral at the last minute.The royals then accompanied the Trumps in a ceremonious horse-drawn carriage ride through the vast grounds of the Windsor estate.King Charles and Trump travelled in the Irish State Coach, with Queen Camilla and the first lady in the Scottish State Coach. Prince William and Kate followed in another carriage, the Semi-State Landau.A military band played the British and US national anthems as the carriages crossed the estate.Trump could be seen chatting with the King as they rode in the carriage together. They continued to chat and joke together as the day progressed, with the King putting his hand on Trump&#x27;s back at one point.On arrival at the Quadrangle of Windsor Castle, King Charles, Queen Camilla and the Trumps took their places on the dais, as the state colours were lowered and the United States&#x27; national anthem played.Trump saluted and the first lady placed her hand on her chest.Melania opted for a grey Dior suit with a purple wide-brimmed hat, which partially covered her eyes, not too dissimilar from the navy and white hat she wore for the president&#x27;s inauguration in January. The King and Queen matched in hues of blue, with Her Majesty in a coat dress by her go-to designer, Fiona Clare, along with a Philip Treacy hat.The Princess of Wales wore a burgundy coat dress by British designer Emilia Wickstead, together with a matching hat by Jane Taylor and a vintage Chanel handbag.But it was her jewellery which caught people&#x27;s eye - Kate wearing a brooch with the three-feathered Prince and Princess of Wales emblem, which has been in the royal family since 1863 and was previously worn by Princess Diana during her marriage to Charles.After the anthems, Trump was then escorted by an officer as he walked along a line of soldiers in red tunics and bearskin hats. Charles accompanied him, following a short distance behind.Trump stepped in front of the King during a review of troops, though Charles had gestured, inviting the president to do so and avoiding a violation of protocol. That was not the case in 2019, when Trump stepped in front of Queen Elizabeth during his first state visit.His Majesty and the president chatted before they returned to the Royal Dais together, where they watched a Rank and March past of The King&#x27;s Troop Royal Horse Artillery, the Household Cavalry and the Foot Guards Guard of Honour. After the march ended, the King and Queen led the Trumps into the castle, where they enjoyed a private lunch in the State Dining Room.Following the lunch, the group made their way into Green Drawing Room to view a special collection of items from the Royal Collection relating to the United States.Items in the collection included essays from George III and a first edition of Captain Smith&#x27;s Historie, one of the earliest accounts of English colonies in North America. There were materials from the first trans-Atlantic cable, including messages between Queen Victoria and President James Buchanan, as well as a 1930s hot dog picnic that a young Elizabeth wrote about, and a large glass vessel that President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave the queen during a 1957 state visit.\"Wow,\" Trump said as he looked at documents on US independence.\"That&#x27;s fascinating,\" King Charles said.One item in particular got quite the reaction from the US president, who had King Charles and Queen Camilla giggling before putting his fist up in a gesture of solidarity. The royals, the US president and first lady all exchanged gifts designed to symbolise both countries&#x27; ties.The King and Queen gave the US president a bespoke, hand bound leather volume specially crafted by the Royal Bindery in Windsor Castle, to celebrate the 250th Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.He was also gifted the Union Flag that flew above Buckingham Palace on the day of his most recent inauguration, 20 January 2025.The first lady was given a personalised handbag by British designer Anya Hindmarch and a silver bowl by an Irish artist.READ MORE: Suspect in Charlie Kirk shooting appears in courtIn return, the Trumps gifted King Charles a replica of a President Eisenhower&#x27;s sword and gave Queen Camilla a vintage Tiffany & Co. gold, diamond and ruby brooch.The president and first lady then travelled in the presidential limousine to St. George&#x27;s Chapel at Windsor Castle to pay a private tribute at Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s tomb.The president pumped his fist at reporters waiting nearby before entering, where he privately went to lay a wreath at the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II, with no cameras allowed. The late queen hosted Trump during his first state visit in 2019.After a tour of nave the US couple was given a performance by young choristers who sang the first movement from Vivaldi&#x27;s Gloria, before having a meet and greet moment.The US president had the kids and his wife all laughing with a comment before they all posed for a quick photo. Afternoon activities in the packed schedule carried on from there with the Trumps heading back to East Lawn of Windsor Castle, where the King and Queen had literally rolled out the red carpet for them.There, they watched more parading by some 200 military musicians, including the State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry and the US Army Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, in an event titled Beating the Retreat.This is a military ceremony that&#x27;s believed to have originated in the early years of organised warfare. Officials say the music chosen is relevant to the bilateral relationship: Eagle Squadron commemorates US pilots who flew in the Royal Air Force during World War II.Golden Friendship, a classic American march, is a favourite of the first lady and is often played for her at the White House, they said.The spectacle was set to conclude with a joint UK-US military F-35 flypast - a first during a state visit - along with a Red Arrows flypast but the fighter jets were cancelled due to poor weather.State banquetTiaras and medals will be on display this evening (Thursday morning AEST) as up to 160 guests gather around a 50-metre long mahogany table set with 200-year-old silver to honour the president at the state banquet.Charles will deliver a speech, then the King and president will offer toasts.Trump won&#x27;t, however, have the chance to address a joint session of Parliament as French President Emmanuel Macron did in July during his state visit, because the House of Commons is in recess.From pomp to politicsAfter a day of royal pomp, Trump will hold talks on Thursday with Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who will tout a new UK-US technology deal.The British government hopes the deal, and billions in investment from US tech firms, will help show that the trans-Atlantic bond remains strong despite differences over Ukraine, the Middle East and the future of NATO.Starmer also hopes to avoid awkward questions about Jeffrey Epstein. Days before the state visit, Starmer fired Britain&#x27;s ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, over the envoy&#x27;s past friendship with the convicted sex offender.On Tuesday, the campaign group Led By Donkeys projected an image of Trump and Epstein on a tower at Windsor Castle, a reminder of the president&#x27;s relationship with the disgraced financier.Police said they arrested four people over the stunt.While Britain&#x27;s royals long ago gave up political power, their history, tradition and celebrity give them a cachet that means presidents and prime ministers covet an invitation to join them.That makes the invitations, handed out at the request of the elected government, a powerful tool to reward friends and wring concessions out of reluctant allies.Protection from protestsMost state visits are staged in London, against the grand backdrop of Buckingham Palace and the broad, flag-lined boulevard known as The Mall.But this one is taking place in the confines of Windsor, a historic town of just over 30,000 people about 40 kilometres west of central London.That makes it easier to control protests and protect the president at a time of increased international tensions, especially after the fatal shooting of Trump ally Charlie Kirk last week in Utah.British police have mounted a massive security operation to ensure the president&#x27;s safety.When Trump was in London on his first state visit in 2019, he was met by thousands of protesters who filled the streets outside the Houses of Parliament as a balloon shaped like a giant, diaper-wearing baby Trump floated overhead.Historian Robert Lacey, a consultant on the Netflix television series The Crown, said Windsor is also a more \"photogenic setting\" for a state visit than London.\"Buckingham Palace has got its balcony, it&#x27;s got its façade,\" he said.But \"inside it&#x27;s very dreary and it&#x27;s currently being renovated, which is one reason why Mr. Trump will not be staying there. Windsor is a proper castle.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Shortly after CBS announced the cancellation of Stephen Colbert&#x27;s late-night talk show – a move Carr publicly celebrated – Trump suggested that \"Next up will be an even less talented Jimmy Kimmel.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
