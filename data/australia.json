Very few people in NSW ever get to be the leader of a major party, and it has been an enormous privilege for me to have that leadership,\" Speakman told media this afternoon.READ MORE: Highly infectious, deadly disease &#x27;likely circulating&#x27; in Aussie capitalHe acknowledged it was only a few hours ago he was adamant his job was safe, having declared \"reports of my death have been grossly exaggerated\" on radio this morning before resigning this afternoon.\"No alternative candidate had come forward to tell me they wanted to be the leader. No colleague had said to me they thought it would be better if I resigned,\" he told media in Sydney.\"But as I said, a day or even half a day or a few hours is a long time in politics.\"By this afternoon, it was clear that there was at least one person who had declared to me that she wished to be the leader of the Liberal Party, and a number of colleagues had indicated to me their preference that we have renewal and regeneration, and a new leader.\"Speakman cancelled a slew of media interviews this afternoon as speculation mounted he could be ousted in a spill, just days after his Victorian counterpart, Brad Battin, also lost his top job.READ MORE: &#x27;AI bubble&#x27; fears eased as world&#x27;s most valuable company clears hurdleRumours of a spill haunted Speakman over the past week and the opposition leader broke his silence in back-to-back radio interviews and an appearance on Sky News.Speakman earlier firmly denied being \"tapped on the shoulder\" while speaking to Ben Fordham on 2GB.But his counter-attack ended prematurely when Speakman pulled the pin on an on-air interview with 9News this afternoon.READ MORE: &#x27;Rapidly intensifying&#x27;: Cyclone turns towards land in dramatic shift9News political reporter Liz Daniels said Speakman had been \"holed up in his office\" and cancelled his media interviews because he wanted to meet with colleagues this afternoon. \"His colleagues, their major criticism of Speakman is that he&#x27;s been unable to land a blow on Chris Minns, a premier who has had a largely charmed political run,\" Daniels said.The gauntlet was thrown down by senior Liberal members as they arrived for parliament today in what is the final sitting week of the year.NSW Liberal Party management committee chairman Nick Greiner said Speakman had shown himself to be a great servant of the party and praised him for his \"tireless service\".\"Mark took on the leadership following the 2023 election and has led the Party with integrity during a challenging period,\" Greiner said.\"His resignation was a gracious and humble act of someone who always put the people of this state first, ahead of any political or personal considerations.\"Kellie Sloane tipped to replace Speakman Shadow health spokesperson Kellie Sloane has emerged as the top contender for Speakman&#x27;s replacement.A party room meeting is expected to take place to decide on the new Liberal leader. Speakman en dorsed Sloane for the job after revealing she told him she wanted to take over as leader.He added that he \"reluctantly agreed\" Sloane should be the next NSW Liberal leader. during this conversation.\"Kellie Sloane will be a fantastic leader if selected by the parliamentary Liberal Party,\" Speakman said.\"She is someone of enormous talent. She is not only a great communicator, she has extensive experience as a businesswoman.\"She is someone I hope will lead the Liberal Party to the next election. She will have my full support. She will have my endorsement.\"Sloane also has the support of other senior Liberal MPs. \"If Kellie Sloane&#x27;s got the numbers, she&#x27;s got to make a move,\" Wendy Tuckerman said earlier today.

Virgin Australia chief operations officer Chris Snook said the policy change was motivated by safety and compliance with international standards.\"Globally, more lithium battery-powered devices are now being carried by travellers, and while these items are generally safe when packed and handled appropriately, this move will minimise any potential risks associated with these devices,\" he said, in a statement. \"The changes to the policy will be permanent from 1 December and reflect our safety-first approach.\"The Australian airlines aren&#x27;t going it alone. Several international carriers including Emirates, Singapore Airlines and Vietnam Airlines have banned the use of power banks on board, and the US Federal Aviation Administration warned airlines of lithium batteries in September.A battery pack was found to be the possible cause of a fire that engulfed an Air Busan plane waiting for takeoff in January and a Delta Air Lines flight from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale in July when smoke and flames started pouring out of a backpack due to the same culprit.READ MORE: NSW Opposition Leader Mark Speakman quits after colleagues turn against himOther fire incidents reportedly linked to batter packs include a fire on a Virgin Australia flight in July and the evacuation of the Qantas lounge in Melbourne when a man&#x27;s battery caught alight early this month.\"Hoping the man who caught fire holding it is ok,\" Australian film producer and Women in Film and Television Australia producer Leanne Tonks posted on Instagram.\"Quick thinking from the man who jumped in to help and the staff who got him in the shower and everyone else out of the lounge.\"FAA fire safety branch manager Robert Ochs said lithium batteries could go into something called \"thermal runaway\".

It comes to the territory, so stop crying.\"Spender, the MP for Wentworth, told ABC Radio at the time that she&#x27;d referred the message to the police.\"It was pretty shocking and not something you ever, ever want to hear,\" she said.The November 8 \"Abolish The Jewish Lobby\" rally sparked calls for tougher laws and an investigation into why the group was legally allowed to protest outside NSW parliament. Police gave the green light to but both NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon and Premier Chris Minns said they were unaware of it until afterwards.Davis was charged with using a carriage service to menace harass or cause offence, a Commonwealth offence that carries a maximum jail term of five years if proven.He is due to face the NSW Bail Division Local Court tomorrow.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
