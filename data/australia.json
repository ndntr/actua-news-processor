          "content": "The personal data of 5.7 million Qantas customers has been released on the dark web by hackers, after a ransom date came and went yesterday.Qantas was one of 40 companies caught up in the hack, alongside the likes of Toyota, Disney and IKEA when the hacker group Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters stole almost 1 billion records of customer data from cloud technology company Salesforce in July.A threat to release the details had been made by the group earlier this week READ MORE: Delivery rider in hospital after his bike and fleeing Porsche crash\"If Salesforce does not engage with us to resolve this, we will completely target each and every individual customers (sic) of theirs listed below, failure to comply will result in massive consequences,\" the statement from the hackers said.In response, Salesforce insisted it would not \"engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand\". The hackers did not break into the Salesforce system, but instead called the IT desks of the 40 companies and posed as legitimate employees.In the case of Qantas, it is believed a call centre in the Philippines was targeted by the hackers.The information of Qantas passengers believed to have been released includes date of birth, emails and frequent flyer numbers.READ MORE: Teenage boy fighting for life after being bitten by sharkThis includes a string of politicians&#x27; home addresses and phone numbers, Cyber Security Coordinator Lieutenant General Michelle McGuinness confirmed in Senate estimates earlier this week.\"There has been a threat actor who has claimed to steal data… Qantas have notified all those who are impacted, and it may be that the threat actor has the data at this stage, the operational experts will, under normal circumstances, look to verify and that would be a question for our operational organisations,\" she said.It is not believed credit card details or passport numbers were compromised in the breach.Qantas has been contacted for comment. It previously told 9news.com.au: \"Ensuring continued vigilance and providing ongoing support for our customers remain our top priorities following our cyber incident in early July.\"We continue to offer a 24/7 support line and specialist identity protection advice to affected customers and through the ongoing injunction we obtained through the NSW Supreme Court we have legal protections in place to prevent the stolen data being accessed or released.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

He said multiple people were killed but declined to say how many, referring to the nineteen missing as \"souls\" because officials were still speaking to family.\"There&#x27;s nothing to describe. It&#x27;s gone,\" Davis said of the plant.READ MORE: Putin praises Trump after failing to win the Nobel prize The blast occurred about 7:45am, Davis said, with aerial footage by WTVF-TV showing the smouldering hilltop facility and the burnt-out shells of vehicles.People reported hearing and feeling the explosion from kilometres away. The company&#x27;s website says it makes and tests explosives at an eight-building facility that sprawls across wooded hills in the Bucksnort area, about ninety-seven kilometres southwest of Nashville.Davis said investigators are trying to determine what happened and couldn&#x27;t say what caused the explosion.There&#x27;s no further danger of explosions, and the scene was under control Friday afternoon, according to Grey Collier, a spokesperson for the Humphreys County Emergency Management Agency.Emergency crews were initially unable to enter the plant because of continuing detonations, Hickman County Advanced EMT David Stewart said by phone. He didn&#x27;t have any details on casualties.Accurate Energetic Systems, based in nearby McEwen, did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment Friday morning.\"This is a tragedy for our community,\" McEwen Mayor Brad Rachford said in an email. He referred further comment to a county official.Residents in Lobelville, a twenty-minute drive from the scene, said they felt their homes shake and some people captured the loud boom of the explosion on their home cameras.The blast rattled Gentry Stover from his sleep.\"I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it,\" he said by phone. \"I live very close to Accurate and I realised about thirty seconds after I woke up that it had to have been that.\"State Rep. Jody Barrett, a Republican from the neighbouring town of Dickson, was worried about the possible economic impact because the plant is a key employer in the area.\"We live probably 15 miles (24km) as the crow flies and we absolutely heard it at the house,\" Barrett said. \"It sounded like something going through the roof of our house.\"READ MORE: Palestinians return to what remains of their homes DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
