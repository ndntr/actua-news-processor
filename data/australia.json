Representatives for Bill Gates told the New York Times Epstein was a \"proven, disgruntled liar\" and rejected all the allegations.\"The only thing these documents demonstrate is Epstein&#x27;s frustration that he did not have an ongoing relationship with Gates and the lengths he would go to entrap and defame,\" a spokesperson said.READ MORE: Scorching heat and high winds trigger extreme fire danger warningsSpeaking on NPR&#x27;s Wild Card podcast, French Gates said the allegations reminded her of \"very, very painful\" times in her marriage to the tech giant.\"Whatever questions remain there of what – I can&#x27;t even begin to know all of it – those questions are for those people and for even my ex-husband,\" she said.\"They need to answer to those things, not me.\" The Gates&#x27; announced their divorce in 2021, dividing a massive fortune as part of the split.READ MORE: Bill and Hillary Clinton agree to testify on Jeffrey Epstein rather than risk prison On Wild Cards, French Gates said she hoped for justice for Epstein&#x27;s victims.\"I&#x27;m able to take my own sadness and look at those young girls and say, my God, how did that happen to those girls?\" she said.\"At least for me, I&#x27;ve been able to move on in life, and I hope there&#x27;s some justice for those now-women.\"NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
