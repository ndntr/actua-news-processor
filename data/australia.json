Alan Barnes, Peter Stogneff, Neil Muir, and Mark Langley are widely believed to have been victims of the group. Despite extensive investigations, no one else has ever been charged in connection with these murders.READ MORE: Sydney&#x27;s first heatwave this Summer has authorities on high alertThe families of the victims express ongoing frustration that von Einem never revealed any information about the alleged \"Family\" network.\"Angry he&#x27;s taken those secrets to the grave, even though I knew he wouldn&#x27;t talk, I knew he wouldn&#x27;t talk,\" Robyn Barnes said.\"Our family&#x27;s been ripped to pieces and scattered in the winds,\" Alan Barnes&#x27; brother John said.Despite von Einem&#x27;s death, the investigation into \"The Family Murders\" remains active.\"Now my mission is just to fight for the truth ... you know, hopefully get some justice, get some closure, for all the victims left behind by this,\" Brooks said.This article was produced with the assistance of 9ExPress.",
