          "content": "A deadly Israeli strike on a Gaza hospital that killed 20 people, including five journalists, was targeting what the military believed was a Hamas surveillance camera, as well as people identified as militants, the Israeli military claimed overnight.The military issued the statement as part of its initial inquiry into the attack, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a \"tragic mishap\".The military said the back-to-back strikes on southern Gaza&#x27;s largest hospital were ordered because soldiers believed militants were using the camera to observe Israeli forces and because Israel has long believed Hamas and other militant groups are present at hospitals, though Israeli officials rarely provide evidence.READ MORE: Two police officers killed, one injured in shooting on rural Victorian propertyThe military&#x27;s chief of general staff acknowledged several \"gaps\" in the investigation so far, including the kind of ammunition used to take out the camera.The initial investigation&#x27;s findings emerged on Tuesday as a surge of outrage and unanswered questions mounted, after international leaders and rights groups condemned the strikes.Earlier on Tuesday, protesters in Israel set tires ablaze, blocked highways and clamoured for a ceasefire that would free hostages still in Gaza, even as Israeli leaders moved forward with plans for an offensive which they argue is needed to defeat Hamas.Meanwhile, Palestinians in Gaza braced for the expanded offensive against a backdrop of displacement, destruction and parts of the territory plunging into famine. The deadly strikes a day earlier killed medics and journalists. Among them was Mariam Dagga, a journalist who worked for The Associated Press and other publications.Netanyahu was expected to convene a security cabinet meeting later on Tuesday. However, the government said the meeting will not include discussion of ceasefire talks, according to an official with knowledge of the situation. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak on the matter, said there was a delegation from Egypt in Israel on Monday and they discussed the negotiations.Netanyahu has said that Israel will launch an expanded offensive in Gaza City while simultaneously pursuing a ceasefire, though Israel has yet to send a negotiating team to discuss a proposal on the table. Netanyahu has said the offensive is the best way to weaken Hamas and return hostages, but hostage families and their supporters have pushed back.READ MORE: Iran orchestrated at least two antisemitic attacks on Australian soil, PM says\"Go back to the negotiation table. There&#x27;s a good deal on the table. It&#x27;s something we can work with,\" said Ruby Chen, the father of 21-year-old Itay Chen, a dual Israeli-American citizen whose body is being held in Gaza. \"We could get a deal done to bring all the hostages back.\"Hamas took 251 hostages on October 7, 2023, in the attack that triggered the current war. Most have been released during previous ceasefires. Israel has managed to rescue only eight hostages alive. Fifty remain in Gaza, and Israeli officials believe around 20 are still alive.Responding to a call from Israel&#x27;s Hostages and Missing Families Forum for a \"National Day of Struggle,\" protesters waved banners that read \"Hostage Deal Now.\" The relatives of hostages said they hope sustained public pressure can push Netanyahu and his security cabinet to commit to meaningful ceasefire talks. However far-right members of his coalition have threatened to resign if Israel agrees to a truce, dismissing the protesters&#x27; demands.\"We could have ended the war a year ago and brought all the hostages and soldiers home. We could have saved hostages and soldiers, but the prime minister chose, again and again, to sacrifice civilians for the sake of his rule,\" said Einav Zangauker, whose 25-year-old son Matan was abducted from one of Israel&#x27;s hardest hit kibbutzim on October 7 and is among those believed to still be alive.Israeli strikes continue after deadly hospital attackCalls for a ceasefire continued a day after the hospital strikes that killed at least the journalists and 15 others, including Dagga, who had covered doctors treating children for starvation at the same facility days before.The strike, among the deadliest of the war against both journalists and hospitals, sparked shock and outrage among press freedom advocates and Palestinians, who mourned the dead at funerals on Monday.READ MORE: Former police officer to plead not guilty to murders of Jesse Baird and Luke DaviesIt was swiftly condemned across the globe. Netanyahu called it a \"tragic mishap\" and said the military would investigate.Most of those killed died after rushing to the scene of the first blast, only to be hit by a second strike — an attack captured on television by several networks.The strike happened as Israel prepared to expand its offensive into densely populated areas of northern Gaza. Israel&#x27;s military wants people in hospitals, displacement camps and Gaza City neighborhoods to evacuate southward to so-called safe zones so it can destroy Hamas and prevent attacks like the October 7, 2023, assault that killed about 1200 people and triggered the war.A day after the strike, Israeli strikes killed at least 16 Palestinians on Tuesday, hospitals said.Officials from Nasser Hospital, Shifa Hospital and Gaza City&#x27;s Sheikh Radwan clinic reported that among the 16 were families, women and children.Gaza&#x27;s Health Ministry also said on Tuesday that three more adults died of causes related to malnutrition and starvation, bringing the malnutrition-related death toll to 186 since late June, when the ministry started to count fatalities among this age category. The toll includes 117 children since the start of the war.Israel&#x27;s military offensive has killed 62,819, according to Gaza&#x27;s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters or civilians but says about half were women and children. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The UN and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.Israeli forces raid downtown RamallahLines of Israeli military vehicles entered downtown Ramallah on Tuesday afternoon in a rare daytime raid on one of the largest Palestinian cities in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.The Israeli military acknowledged an ongoing operation in the city but would not provide any information about the purpose of the raid.Ramallah is the headquarters of the Palestinian Authority, which cooperates with Israel on security and has been largely sidelined since the start of the war. The city has faced similar raids before, including in May when Israeli forces targeted money transfer businesses there and in other Palestinian cities, alleging they had ties to militant groups.The Palestinian Red Crescent said there were 58 injuries during the raid, including injuries from live fire, rubber bullets, tear gas inhalation, and \"live bullet shrapnel\". Israeli armored vehicles entered a busy downtown intersection in the city, stopping traffic. A few dozen people attempted to throw rocks at the military vehicles.The war in Gaza has sparked a surge of violence in the West Bank, with the Israeli military carrying out large-scale operations targeting militants that have killed hundreds of Palestinians and displaced tens of thousands. That has coincided with a rise in settler violence and Palestinian attacks on Israelis.There have been more than 1000 attacks by Israeli settlers throughout 2025, with 11 Palestinians killed and about 700 injured, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.",

          "content": "Iran&#x27;s foreign minister has labelled Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese \"weak\", deliberately echoing the words of the leader of Iran&#x27;s sworn enemy Israel in response to the expulsion of Tehran&#x27;s ambassador to Canberra.Albanese yesterday revealed Iran orchestrated at least two alleged antisemitic firebombings on Australian soil last year, a subject that&#x27;s sure to come up when Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles meets with US Vice President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth this morning.In response to the \"unprecedented attack\" on the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne and Lewis&#x27; Continental Kitchen in Sydney last year, Australia expelled ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi and three other Iranian officials, while declaring Iran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organisation.READ MORE: Iran orchestrated at least two antisemitic attacks on Australian soil, PM says ASIO Director-General Mike Burgess said his intelligence organisation found Iran directed \"at least two and likely more attacks on Jewish interests in Australia\", using \"a complex web of proxies to hide its involvement\".\"Our painstaking investigation uncovered and unpicked the links between the alleged crimes and commanders in Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC,\" he said.Burgess did not lay out the specific evidence tying the IRGC to the attacks but said such formal assessments were \"not done quickly or taken lightly\" and the agency&#x27;s intelligence analysts&#x27; conclusions were clear.Iran&#x27;s Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei rejected the \"baseless\" accusations, vowing a \"reciprocal response\" before Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stepped up the rhetoric.Early this morning, he shared a screenshot of a BBC article reporting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s extraordinary personal attack last week on Albanese in retaliation for promising to recognise a Palestinian state and blocking a far-right Israeli MP from visiting Australia.\"I am not in the habit of joining causes with wanted War Criminals, but Netanyahu is right about one thing: Australia&#x27;s PM is indeed a &#x27;weak politician&#x27;,\" Araghchi said, on X.READ MORE: &#x27;Revolutionary&#x27; terror group behind antisemitic attacks in Australia https://x.com/araghchi/status/1960350042008531222\"Iran is home to among the world&#x27;s oldest Jewish communities including dozens of synagogues. \"Accusing Iran of attacking such sites in Australia while we do our utmost to protect them in our own country makes zero sense.\"Netanyahu last week labelled Albanese a \"weak politician who betrayed Israel and abandoned Australia&#x27;s Jews\" before taking to Australian TV to double down on his personal attack. In response Albanese said he treated world leaders with respect and \"doesn&#x27;t take these things personally\", but Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke didn&#x27;t show such restraint.https://x.com/IsraeliPM/status/1957722795049398502\"Strength is not measured by how many people you can blow up, or how many children you can leave hungry,\" Burke said.Early this morning, Araghchi claimed Iran was \"paying the price for the Australian people&#x27;s support for Palestine\". \"Canberra should know better than to attempt to appease a regime led by War Criminals,\" he wrote.\"Doing so will only embolden Netanyahu and his ilk.\"Michael Shoebridge, a former Australian defence and security official and director of the think tank Strategic Analysis Australia, said he didn&#x27;t believe the move to expel the Iranian ambassador was prompted by Israel&#x27;s complaints.\"I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a matter of Australia-Israel relations, but a matter of community cohesion here in Australia,\" he said.Yesterday was the first time Canberra has declared a foreign ambassador persona non grata since the end of World War II. \"These were extraordinary and dangerous acts of aggression orchestrated by a foreign nation on Australian soil,\" Albanese said.\"They were attempts to undermine social cohesion and sow discord in our community.\"Flinders University international conflict expert Dr Jessica Genauer said the looming designation of the IRGC as a terrorist group was just as remarkable as the expulsion of the ambassador.\"It&#x27;s very unusual for a state to designate part of another state entity as a terror group,\" she said, describing the IRGC as even more tightly integrated with the state of Iran than Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Taliban, which was not in power at the time of Australia&#x27;s designation, in Afghanistan.\"So that&#x27;s something else we&#x27;re seeing that is almost unprecedented.\"She told 9News the attacks by Iran were unlikely to be unique to Australia.\"It&#x27;s just that this is the first time that our intelligence agencies are coming out in such a strong way and saying, &#x27;Yes, we have clear evidence that links the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to these terror attacks on Australian soil&#x27;.\"Burke earlier in the day said Iran&#x27;s actions were an \"unprecedented attack\" on Australia.\"It&#x27;s aimed at creating fear, stoking internal divisions, and eroding social cohesion. It&#x27;s true that no one was injured in these attacks, it&#x27;s not true that no one was harmed,\" he said.Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-CEO Alex Ryvchin described Albanese&#x27;s announcement as both comforting and \"chilling\".\"Well, on the one hand, it brings us some comfort to know that our law enforcement and security agencies are so good and working so hard to keep us safe, to bring the perpetrators to justice, to uncover the layers of this plot and to protect all Australians from terrorism,\" he told 9News. \"But on the other hand, to learn, have confirmed what the Iranian regime that plotted and had carried out at least two of the attacks, it&#x27;s a chilling development because you&#x27;re dealing with a foreign actor which has sown discord and bloodshed throughout the Middle East and the wider world for many years.\"Australian Iranian Community Organisation president Siamak Ghahreman welcomed the federal government&#x27;s decision.\"The Iranian government is against its own people, and that&#x27;s why many people who are living in Australia actually flee the country,\" he told 9News.- Reported with Associated Press.

You are not free to leave.\"He&#x27;s told to sit down and he is eventually asked to leave the courtroom while trying to read out a document to the court.Late tonight, police were still combing bushland near Porepunkah for the alleged gunman.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "The sovereign citizen movement has once again been thrust into the mainstream spotlight following the deadly shooting of two police officers in Victoria&#x27;s alpine region.It&#x27;s an uncentralised belief system but is generally characterised by an anti-authority idea that they are not under the jurisdiction of the government and the law does not apply to them.It&#x27;s why, for many years, it was typically associated with videos of someone getting pulled over for a traffic stop and refusing to provide their details to police, claiming law enforcement has no authority over them – only to be arrested shortly after. READ MORE: Major changes coming to how Aussies visit Europe While s ome may find videos of their arrests entertaining, the beliefs can be far more dangerous than they might seem.Extremists within the movement have carried out violent crimes both in Australia and overseas – most recently, it is believed, in Victoria but also previously in Queensland.The movement has received a significant influx of followers following the COVID-19 pandemic as people retaliated against lockdowns, mask mandates and vaccination requirements.So what exactly is a sovereign citizen? Here&#x27;s what you need to know.READ MORE: What we know about the fatal police shooting in Porepunkah What do sovereign citizens believe?Sovereign citizens – or \"SovCits\" – is a term for people who hold extreme anti-government views , essentially believing laws and regulations don&#x27;t apply to them.The idea is that, in the same way a country is a sovereign nation unconstrained by other nations&#x27; laws, a person is themselves a sovereign unconstrained by the laws of a government.\"It&#x27;s a spectrum,\" David Heilpern, dean of law at Southern Cross University, told Today Extra.READ MORE: The costly hidden issue lurking under the toilets in homes around Australia\"On the one hand, there are those who want to challenge the law by raising old doctrine common law doctrines and concepts of sovereignty. That&#x27;s probably a positive thing.\"At the other end, there are those who simply refuse to comply with laws that apply to you and I. They see themselves as separate and different. They say they don&#x27;t consent to the jurisdiction.\"And by their own declaration, they&#x27;re not bound by laws.\"READ MORE: The future of rewards points in AustraliaThe exact reasoning behind this varies within the movement – no surprise given its uncentralised nature – but the idea of false governments is a common one for sovereign citizens around the globe.One prevalent thought is Redemption Theory, which asserts the US (which is where the movement began) went bankrupt in 1933 when it abandoned the gold standard. It claims the government then began using its citizens as collateral in agreements with other nations. Redemption Theorists go on to claim each person, therefore, has a monetary value – up to millions of dollars – stored in a secret US Treasury Department account listed under someone else&#x27;s name. Some followers will also avoid entering into \"contracts\" with the government.It&#x27;s why many of them are pulled over for driving without a licence or vehicle registration – or for just failing to produce such documents or provide their name and address when pulled over – and why you&#x27;ll hear phrases like \"I do not consent\" during exchanges between sovereign citizens and police officers.READ MORE: Inside the government&#x27;s $2 billion plan to divert children with mild autism off the NDIS So are they actually exempt from taxation and able to drive without a licence? No. Just like anyone else, sovereign citizens must abide by the laws of the country they live in, including Australia.\"I was a magistrate for 22 years I saw a lot of these sovereign citizen arguments,\" Heilpern said.\"They hold no weight whatsoever. It&#x27;s legal gobbledygook.\"That means they need to have a driver&#x27;s licence, pay their taxes, register their vehicle, and otherwise obey the law.In a 2021 case in Queensland, a sovereign citizen charged with two drug offences tried to argue that the charges didn&#x27;t apply to him. Sign up here to receive our daily newsletters and breaking news alerts, sent straight to your inbox.Judge Glen Cash gave his arguments – and that of the entire movement – a scathing appraisal.\"Merely setting out the argument is sufficient to show it is nonsense,\" he wrote in his decision.\"It is apparent that the applicant is one of a group of people who for some years have attempted, universally without success, to avoid the operation of laws with which they do not wish to comply...\"Recognising that the arguments presented by [such] litigants are largely incoherent, if not incomprehensible, courts have been increasingly willing to dismiss their claims summarily. \"So no, sovereign citizens are certainly not exempt from the law. Where did the movement start and why can it be dangerous? The sovereign citizen movement arose in the 1970s in America following the founding of anti-government group Posse Comitatus by William Porter Gale – a group which had \"racist and antisemitic\" origins, according to the Southern Poverty Law Centre, a social justice organisation in the US.The movement rose in prominence and spread to different countries, including Australia, in the following decades, and has since received a notable boost during the pandemic.\"It&#x27;s fair to say that one of the recalls of COVID was a disillusionment by a significant proportion of the public with government and with health, with law, with their connection with society,\" Heilpern said.\"They&#x27;ve gone looking elsewhere for justification for their views of &#x27;these laws don&#x27;t apply to me&#x27;.\"While it&#x27;s not necessarily inherently violent, extremists within the movement have committed violent crimes. Mike Burgess, the ASIO director-general, brought the risk of sovereign extremists to the attention of Australia in his 2022 threat assessment speech. READ MORE: The fractured relationship daughter had with the Queensland cop killers\"Some of the alleged violent acts at the recent Old Parliament House protest are a case in point. The individuals involved were driven by a diverse range of grievances, including anti-vaccination agendas, conspiracy theories and anti-government sovereign citizen beliefs. \"Burgess isn&#x27;t the only top intelligence official to warn of the dangers of such beliefs.Back in 201 1, the FBI&#x27;s Counterterrorism Analysis Section stated it \"considers sovereign-citizen extremists as comprising a domestic terrorist movement\", and it remains a serious issue today.\"We know there&#x27;s been many cases of violence from sovereign citizens in the US including shootings of police,\" political sociologist and Associate Professor from Deakin University Dr Josh Roose said in 2023.\"About 15 per cent of domestic terrorism load, according to the FBI, in the US over the last five years was sovereign citizens.\"It&#x27;s also reached Australia with deadly consequences.Most recently, police believe the active shooter in Porepunkah, Victoria, who has killed two officers and injured one more, is a sovereign citizen.Previously, the Wieambilla shooting in December 2022 – the ambush killing of Queensland police constables Matthew Arnold and Rachel McCrow, and neighbour Alan Dare, by Gareth, Stacey and Nathaniel Train – was linked to sovereign citizens.Queensland Police later labelled it a \"religiously motivated terrorist attack\" driven by an extremist set of evangelical Christian beliefs known as premillennialism, although deputy commissioner Tracy Linford said the trio&#x27;s behaviour was similar to sovereign citizens.Gareth&#x27;s internet behaviour unearthed after the shootings showed him promoting anti-government and anti-law enforcement ideologies.\"At that more extreme end, (the beliefs) can end up being pretty dangerous as we see in ... the connections between those involved with the sovereign citizen or pseudo law movement and horrible incidents like we saw in Queensland involving police late last year,\" Heilpern said.Notable extremist sovereign citizens from the US include Terry Nichols, who helped plan the Oklahoma City bombing, and Jerry R. Kane Jr and 16-year-old Joseph T. Kane, a father-son pair who killed two police officers in a traffic stop in Arkansas in 2010.READ MORE: How Labor&#x27;s fast-tracked 5 per cent deposit scheme will actually work For the most part, though, the movement has a legal focus, with followers using certain phrases in an attempt to demonstrate laws don&#x27;t apply to them, and even conducting what&#x27;s known as \"paper terrorism\" – filing bogus, frivolous and often excessive legal paperwork to harass and intimidate someone.\"They bombard big firms with pseudo-legal paperwork, file bogus legal claims, they talk about arresting the police or the governor general or storming parliament and taking over,\" Roose said.\"So there&#x27;s different dimensions. It is a significant concern, as we&#x27;ve seen... up in Queensland.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
