Officers led away a woman and a baby. Nobody in the house is accused of any wrongdoing.Police would not comment on the operation and only said the investigation was ongoing.Also overnight, an emotional vigil was held in the town of Wangaratta for one of the officers shot dead in the attack.The town is where Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson, 59, used to work. He was only two weeks away from retirement when he died.Freeman is accused of shooting dead Thompson and Constable Vadim De Waart on Tuesday morning at a home in Porepunkah.A third officer was allegedly shot and wounded in the leg and is recovering in hospital.Freeman is a self-described \"sovereign citizen\" who is known to police.According to the Australian Federal Police, a sovereign citizen – also known as a SovCit – seeks to \"disassociate from society and refuses to engage with societal requirements like paying tax\".Police said he had several firearms on him, with senior officers confirming police had not recovered any weapons used in the attack. Hundreds of officers and specialist police have swarmed the small country town as Victoria Police commit every resource available to track down and apprehend Freeman.P olice are still working on the theory that the accused gunman remains in the Porepunkah area.Deputy Commissioner of Regional Operations Russell Barrett said yesterday the search area had been expanded but Freeman was believed to be close by.He also said the manhunt had been taking longer than expected. The rough terrain has been making the search difficult.
