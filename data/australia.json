A \"significant\" aerial search using special drones with infrared technology was used on Friday and Saturday.It is the same technology police used in the search for the remains of Julian Story in Port Lincoln. \"It&#x27;s quite complex technology, so the results will take some time to work through, but police will investigate any findings through further searches,\" police said today.Police said officers may return to the property once the results of the drone mission are finalised. Over the past 48 hours, the search for Gus shifted to a recovery mission.Police spoke to the family last week to prepare them for the grim likelihood Gus has not survived. READ MORE: Half of Aussies think it&#x27;s OK to commit this &#x27;risky&#x27; WFH breach\"On Tuesday night senior police spoke to Gus&#x27; family and prepared them for the fact that Gus may not have survived due to the passage of time, his age and the nature of the terrain he is missing in,\" Parrott added.\"This assessment was based on medical evidence from a doctor who is recognised by the Australian rescue authorities as an expert opinion on time frame for survival.\"While those involved in the search have been hoping for a miracle, over the past 48 hours the search has shifted to a recovery operation.\"Police continue to investigate Gus&#x27; disappearance and are working to rule out every option. A public appeal remains in place for anyone with information. \"If anything is any information comes that directs us to conduct further searches in specific areas, we will be doing that in the coming weeks,\" Williams said.\"As we&#x27;ve stated, we will never give up hope of finding Gus.\"There are further lines of inquiry being undertaken and the family have continued to cooperate fully with police and have consented to every request that we have made of them thus far.\"An average of 30 SES volunteers have taken part in the search for Gus each day.The Australian Defence Force (ADF) also provided 50 personel for two days to assist police.Before it was scaled back, the search for Gus spanned seven days and an area of almost 500 square kilometres, involving aircraft and teams on the ground.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
