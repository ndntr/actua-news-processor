          "content": "In a minutes-long strike inside the world&#x27;s most-visited museum, thieves rode a cherrypicker to the Louvre, forced a window into the Galerie d&#x27;Apollon — while tourists pressed shoulder-to-shoulder in the corridors — smashed display cases and fled with priceless Napoleonic jewels, officials said.It was among the highest-profile museum thefts in recent memory and comes as Louvre employees have complained of worker and security understaffing.One object was found later on Sunday outside the museum, according to Culture Minister Rachida Dati. French daily Le Parisien reported it was the emerald-studded crown of Napoleon III&#x27;s wife Empress Eugénie — gold, diamonds and sculpted eagles — recovered just beyond the walls, broken.READ MORE: &#x27;Suspicious&#x27; Macca&#x27;s order leads to machete-wielding ambushThe theft unfolded just 250 metres from the Mona Lisa, in what Dati described as \"a four-minute operation\". No one was hurt.Images from the scene showed confused tourists being steered out of the glass pyramid and adjoining courtyards as officers closed nearby streets along the Seine.Also visible was a lift braced to the Seine-facing facade near a construction zone — an extraordinary vulnerability at a palace-museum.READ MORE: Records set to tumble as states swelterA museum already under strainAbout 9.30am (6.30pm AEDT), several intruders forced a window, cut panes with a disc cutter and went straight for the vitrines, officials said. Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said the crew entered from outside using a basket lift.The choice of target compounded the shock. The vaulted Galerie d&#x27;Apollon in the Denon wing, capped by a ceiling painted for Louis XIV, displays a selection of the French crown jewels.The thieves are believed to have approached via the riverfront facade, where construction is under way, used a freight elevator to reach the hall, took nine pieces from a 23-item collection linked to Napoleon and the Empress, and made off on motorbikes, according to Le Parisien.Daylight robberies during public hours are rare. Pulling one off inside the Louvre — with visitors present — ranks among Europe&#x27;s most audacious since Dresden&#x27;s Green Vault museum in 2019, and the most serious in France in more than a decade.It also collides with a deeper tension the Louvre has struggled to resolve: swelling crowds and stretched staff. The museum delayed opening during a June staff walkout over overcrowding and chronic understaffing. Unions say mass tourism leaves too few eyes on too many rooms and creates pressure points where construction zones, freight routes and visitor flows meet.Security around marquee works remains tight — the Mona Lisa is behind bulletproof glass in a bespoke, climate-controlled case.It&#x27;s unclear whether staffing levels played any role in Sunday&#x27;s breach.The Louvre has a long history of thefts and attempted robberies. The most famous came in 1911, when the Mona Lisa vanished from its frame, stolen by Vincenzo Peruggia and recovered two years later in Florence.Today the former royal palace holds a roll call of civilization: Leonardo&#x27;s Mona Lisa; the armless serenity of the Venus de Milo; the Winged Victory of Samothrace, wind-lashed on the Daru staircase; the Code of Hammurabi&#x27;s carved laws; Delacroix&#x27;s Liberty Leading the People; Géricault&#x27;s The Raft of the Medusa. More than 33,000 works — from Mesopotamia, Egypt and the classical world to Europe&#x27;s masters — draw a daily tide of up to 30,000 visitors even as investigators now begin to sweep those gilded corridors for clues.Politics at the doorThe heist spilled instantly into politics. Far-right leader Jordan Bardella used it to attack President Emmanuel Macron, weakened at home and facing a fractured parliament.\"The Louvre is a global symbol of our culture,\" Bardella wrote on X.\"This robbery, which allowed thieves to steal jewels from the French Crown, is an unbearable humiliation for our country. How far will the decay of the state go?\"The criticism lands as Macron touts a decade-long \"Louvre New Renaissance\" plan — about €700 million ($1.26 billion) to modernise infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031. For workers on the floor, the relief has felt slower than the pressure.What we know — and don&#x27;tForensic teams are examining the site of the crime and adjoining access points while a full inventory is taken, authorities said. Officials have described the haul as of \"inestimable\" historical value. Recovery may prove difficult.\"It&#x27;s unlikely these jewels will ever be seen again,\" said Tobias Kormind, managing director of 77 Diamonds.\"Professional crews often break down and re-cut large, recognisable stones to evade detection, effectively erasing their provenance.\"The Louvre closed for the rest of Sunday as police sealed gates, cleared courtyards and shut nearby streets along the Seine.Key questions still unanswered are how many people took part in the theft and whether they had inside assistance, authorities said. According to French media, there were four perpetrators: two dressed as construction workers in yellow safety vests on the lift, and two each on a scooter.Investigators are reviewing CCTV from the Denon wing and the riverfront, inspecting the basket lift used to reach the gallery and interviewing staff who were on site when the museum opened, authorities said.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "standfirst": "Two unedifying displays were enough to make any world leader tetchy about a date with the US president, so does the prime minister have anything to worry about?",
          "content": "When Anthony Albanese meets Donald Trump at the White House in a little under 48 hours, he&#x27;ll be hoping to avoid the wretched fate two other world leaders have suffered at the hands of the US president.Both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa were publicly ambushed after stepping into the Oval Office earlier this year.First it was Zelenskyy, who was berated by Trump and Vice-President JD Vance in February for not being grateful enough for US aid in the face of Russia&#x27;s invasion, even though Trump had recently labelled the Ukrainian president a dictator and parrotted Kremlin talking points.READ MORE: New report claims most essential workers can barely afford to rent \"This is going to be great television,\" Trump mused in front of Zelenskyy.Months later, Ramaphosa was blindsided when Trump dimmed the lights to play \"a couple of things\" purporting to be proof of a genocide against white farmers in South Africa – although the so-called evidence, including an image of burial sites in the Democratic Republic of Congo, was baseless and misleading.The unedifying displays were enough to make any world leader tetchy about a date with the US president, so does Albanese have anything to worry about?The prime minister himself insists not, saying last week that he was \"not at all\" nervous about the meeting, pointing to the \"really warm discussions\" he&#x27;s previously had with Trump.READ MORE: The grisly task that helped track down a man who murdered dozens of Aussies Certainly, the relationship between the US and Australia is better than that of the White House and Zelenskyy – who Trump clashed with as far back as 2019 – and South Africa, which has seen its aid cut and faced accusations of white genocide (which local authorities deny) by the Trump administration.But there are some sticking points between Washington and Canberra. The decision made by the federal government to join the likes of the United Kingdom, France and Canada in recognising Palestine as a state put it at odds with Trump, while the Pentagon is unhappy with Australia&#x27;s defence spending levels.Before Trump&#x27;s second term began, Australia had already committed to an increase in military spending from about 2 to 2.4 per cent of GDP by 2034 – still well short of the 3.5 per cent US War Secretary Pete Hegseth is calling for.READ MORE: Half of Aussies think it&#x27;s OK to commit this &#x27;risky&#x27; WFH breach For the government&#x27;s part, it says defence spending is actually far higher than what the raw figures suggest.\"We&#x27;re overseeing the largest increase in defence funding outside of war in the history of the country, and secondly, we&#x27;ve also been explaining that using the NATO methodology, which is the preferred methodology to compare these things, we&#x27;re already at 2.8 per cent of GDP before all our increases kick in,\" Defence Industry Minister Pat Conroy said on Thursday.\"So put that into context: that&#x27;s bigger than anyone in Europe, other than Poland and the Baltic states, it&#x27;s bigger than the United Kingdom, and it&#x27;s larger than any of the other Indo-Pacific partners.\"Albanese also holds some cards of his own: the recent defence deal with Papua New Guinea, with the potential for another with Fiji to follow, limiting Beijing&#x27;s push for greater Pacific influence; billions of dollars heading to the US under the AUKUS pact; plus Washington&#x27;s interest in a critical minerals deal to ease the reliance on China for the crucial rare earths.READ MORE: Nurses say they are forced to run risks of daily $65 fines just to get to work The latter has been touted as a potential bargaining chip to have Australia exempt from US tariffs – 50 per cent on steel and aluminium, as well as a 10 per cent baseline duty.And according to defence analyst Michael Shoebridge, there&#x27;s another factor in the prime minister&#x27;s favour: the sheer weight of other issues Trump is focusing on.\"Trump is a busy man – and when it comes to Australia, that means he&#x27;s just not that into us,\" he wrote for the Lowy Institute after the meeting was announced. \"That&#x27;s likely to mean he won&#x27;t focus as much as we fear on his Aussie visitor and the challenges and differences we&#x27;re all so worried about. \"In the world of 2025, that amounts to good news.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Cheeseman claimed those who \"picked a fight\" with police were only seen within the counter-protest group and not within the March for Australia group.\" The people that came to pick the fight with police are the issue-motivated groups on the left,\" Cheeseman said.\"I can tell you that the March for Australia group were peaceful, they were engaging, they listened to our instructions, they did what they were told, and they protested by example.\"Cheeseman refused to confirm the exact number of protesters from both sides, but believed around 1000 people were present in Melbourne on Sunday. Reports from The Age claim some witnesses heard racist conspiracy theories being shared by some in the anti-immigration rally; Cheeseman said Victoria Police had zero tolerance for racism and would investigate such claims, but said there were no reports of poor behaviour in the main protest.READ MORE: More than 1600 customers of Dodo and iPrimus impacted by cybersecurity breach\"We are certainly not tolerant of that sort of language and that rhetoric.

He said police were happy to defend people&#x27;s right to protest, but said police have the right to be safe while working.\"We don&#x27;t come to work to get assaulted, we don&#x27;t come to work to get these rocks thrown at us, we come to work to make sure it&#x27;s a safe environment for everybody, for the left, for the right, everybody,\" he said.\"Yet we somehow find ourselves the target of behaviour that is simply unacceptable...
