There have been no fatalities recorded. One victim remains in a life-threatening condition – a member of train staff whom police say saved lives with his \"heroic\" actions.READ MORE: UK mass train stabbing: What we know about horrific attackMajor incident declared Police had earlier declared a major incident and counter-terrorism officers were initially helping with the investigation, but no motive had been confirmed.\"This is a shocking incident and first and foremost my thoughts are with those who have been injured this evening and their families,\" Chief Superintendent Chris Casey said earlier.\"We&#x27;re conducting urgent enquiries to establish what has happened, and it could take some time before we are in a position to confirm anything further.READ MORE: Man charged with murder after woman found dead in Hunter Valley home \"At this early stage it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident.\"Our response is ongoing at the station and will be for some time.\"Cordons are in place and trains are not currently running through the area, and there are also some road closures.\"\"Plato\" was declared initially - the UK code word used by emergency services when responding to a \"marauding terror attack\" - before it was later rescinded.British Transport Police previously said on X that officers were \"responding to an incident on a train to Huntingdon where multiple people have been stabbed”.Cambridgeshire Constabulary, the local police force, said armed police attended after officers were called to the scene at Huntingdon Station at 7.42pm on Saturday (6.42am Sunday AEDT).The two people were arrested at the station, which is about 120 kilometres north of London.The train was the 6.25pm service travelling from Doncaster to London King&#x27;s Cross , British Transport Police confirmed.\"Armed officers attended and the train was stopped at Huntingdon, where two men were arrested. A number of people have been taken to hospital,\" Cambridge Police said in a statement.Politicians describe &#x27;deeply concerning&#x27;, &#x27;horrendous scenes&#x27; Paul Bristow, the mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, said in a post on X he had heard of reports of “horrendous scenes” on the train.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the incident \"deeply concerning\".\"My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police,\" he said on X.https://x.com/Keir_Starmer/status/1984743058856869942British Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was \"deeply saddened to hear about the stabbings\", and that her \"thoughts go out to all those affected\".\"Two suspects have been immediately arrested and taken into custody,\" she said in a post on X.Mahmood said she was receiving regular updates on the investigation and urged people to avoid \"speculation at this early stage\" as to what was behind the stabbings.Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch also responded to the incident in a post on X.\"This is an absolutely horrific attack and my thoughts are with all those affected including the emergency responders at the scene,\" Badenoch wrote.The East Coast Main Line is one of the UK&#x27;s busiest and most important railway routes.It connects major cities, running from London King&#x27;s Cross to Edinburgh Waverley in Scotland.David Horne, managing director of train firm LNER, said the operator was \"deeply shocked and saddened by the serious incident\".He said passengers should check before travelling.Earlier, the company told train passengers not to travel. - With additional details by CNN and Associated Press DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
