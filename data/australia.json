          "content": "A n accused gunman who killed two police officers and injured a third remains on the run more than 36 hours after the deadly shooting in rural Victoria.A manhunt for alleged offender Dezi Freeman continued overnight after the operation plunged the entire town of Porepunkah into lockdown on Tuesday morning.Freeman allegedly fled into the bush after gunning down two police officers who had attended his property to execute a warrant. The slain officers were named yesterday as Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim De Waart.READ MORE: Officers killed in Porepunkah shooting named The situation remained \"active\" and police warned residents to stay alert and listen to advice as hundreds of officers combed Porepunkah for the accused cop killer.Premier Jacinta Allan last night urged the community to come together after a \"difficult day\".\"It&#x27;s a way, a very physical way, that we can say to the men and women of Victoria Police we stand with you, we support you, we care for you and we love you,\" Allan said in a media address.\"Particularly in this time of grief, and particularly to the broader Victorian community, now is the time for unity.\"Now is the time to join together and show support, not just for Victoria police, to those emergency services, but to each other.Porepunkah Primary School will reopen today.Nightmare task tracking gunman Police have admitted Freeman, who lives on the semi-rural property in Porepunkah where the shooting took place, knows the area better than them.But Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Mike Bush emphasised \"expert\" police resources were pouring in to help find him.\"He knows that area. Even though we have experts in the area, he will know that area better than us,\" Bush said yesterday.Asked if it was possible Freeman had laid traps for searchers, or had resorted to a hypothetical bunker, Bush said \"anything&#x27;s possible\".\"Our people are used to those sorts of interventions and are well briefed,\" he said.READ MORE: Australia put on notice by Donald Trump&#x27;s latest tech tariff threatLocals remained on edge overnight as they awaited news from police amid fears the manhunt could stretch into many days.\"He&#x27;s a very experienced bushman, and I think it would be very hard to find him,\" one resident told 9News.\"That bloke could be anywhere in the bush,\" another said.\"Put you a bit on the edge.\"Bush urged people not to help Freeman lie low in the area.\"Don&#x27;t support this person. It&#x27;s very dangerous,\" he said.\"He&#x27;s killed two police officers and injured a third. He does not deserve anyone&#x27;s assistance.\"Police have also warned Freeman could be armed with \"several\" firearms. \"We believe he has longarms, powerful firearms, multiple firearms,\" Bush said.He refused to comment on reports that Freeman had taken a fallen officer&#x27;s gun.Freeman&#x27;s family presented to police on Tuesday night and have been confirmed as safe. \"We understood where they were and we invited his partner to a police station where we&#x27;ve spoken to her,\" he said.\"I think the partner did go willingly to the police station to meet with us.\"Police also met with the couple&#x27;s children to confirm their safety.Locals in Porepunkah have still been told to stay inside and \"be vigilant\".READ MORE: What is the &#x27;sovereign citizen&#x27; movement?Bush repeated the message from police for locals not to go outside unless it was absolutely necessary.Alpine Shire Council, which includes Porepunkah in its LGA, said council facilities would stay closed yesterday.READ MORE: How Labor&#x27;s fast-tracked 5 per cent deposit Home Guarantee Scheme will actually workWho is Dezi Freeman? The accused gunman on the run has been identified as Dezi Freeman.He is a self-described \"sovereign citizen\" who is known to police.According to the Australian Federal Police, a sovereign citizen – also known as a SovCit – seeks to \"disassociate from society and refuses to engage with societal requirements like paying tax\".Bush yesterday said Freeman had been living on the property in Porepunkah which had an \"adjoining bus\". Freeman was earlier revealed to have referred to police as \"frigging Nazis\", \"Gestapo\" and \"terrorist thugs\", a court judgement shows.He tried to take a police officer and the County Court of Victoria to the Supreme Court of Victoria in November 2024 to fight driving offences.In another brush with the legal system, Freeman tried to \"arrest\" a magistrate and several police officers while appearing in Wangaratta Magistrates Court.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
