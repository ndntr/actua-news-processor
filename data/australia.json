          "content": "Tyler Robinson, the accused shooter of US conservative proselytiser Charlie Kirk, has appeared in court via video after being charged with aggravated murder.Robinson appeared briefly before a judge early Wednesday AEST.He nodded slightly at times but mostly stared straight ahead as the judge read the charges against him and appointed an attorney to represent him.READ MORE: &#x27;Very bad tone&#x27;: Trump&#x27;s shocking threat to Aussie reporterRobinson, 22, was earlier charged with aggravated murder, a US prosecutor announced, saying Robinson left behind his DNA on the trigger of the rifle that fired the fatal shot.The charge means Robinson could face the death penalty if convicted of killing Kirk last week at Utah Valley University in Orem, about 64km south of Salt Lake City.\"The murder of Charlie Kirk is an American tragedy,\" Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said in announcing the charges.READ MORE: What do we know about Tyler Robinson, the man who allegedly killed Charlie Kirk? Kirk was gunned down on September 10 as he spoke with students and died soon after. Prosecutors allege Robinson shot Kirk in the neck with a bolt-action rifle from the roof of a nearby campus building.A Utah Valley University police officer was watching the university campus crowd from an \"elevated position\" and identified the roof of the Losee Centre as a potential position for a shooter, Gray said.The officer found evidence on the roof immediately, he said, and spurred officers to direct their attention to surveillance video leading to the roof.Gray said Robinson discarded the rifle and clothing and asked his roommate to conceal evidence.Robinson left a note under a keyboard saying he planned to kill Kirk and confessed after the shooting, documents show.READ MORE: Charlie Kirk&#x27;s social media accounts have gained millions of followers since his murder Robinson also was charged with felony discharge of a firearm, punishable by up to life in prison, and obstructing justice, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.He was scheduled to appear on camera for a virtual court hearing Tuesday afternoon.It was unclear whether Robinson had an attorney who could speak on his behalf, and his family has declined to comment to The Associated Press.Robinson appears to have stayed in the area after shooting Kirk and ditching his rifle, authorities said.Text messages shared with a roommateIn a text exchange with his roommate released by authorities, Robinson wrote, \"I had planned to grab my rifle from my drop point shortly after, but most of that side of town got locked down. Its quiet, almost enough to get out, but theres one vehicle lingering.\"Then he wrote: \"Going to attempt to retrieve it again, hopefully they have moved on. I haven&#x27;t seen anything about them finding it.\"And after that, he sent: \"I can get close to it but there is a squad car parked right by it. I think they already swept that spot, but I don&#x27;t wanna chance it.\"The texts shared in court documents do not have timestamps, and it&#x27;s unclear how long after the shooting Robinson was texting.READ MORE: Hollywood heartthrob Robert Redford dies, aged 89 Robinson was arrested late Thursday near St. George, the southern Utah community where he grew up.Investigators have spoken to Robinson&#x27;s relatives and carried out a search warrant at his family&#x27;s home in Washington, Utah, about 390km southwest of where the shooting happened.Kirk, a dominant figure in conservative politics, became a confidant of President Donald Trump after founding Arizona-based Turning Point USA, one of the nation&#x27;s largest political organisations.He brought young, conservative evangelical Christians into politics. His shooting raised fears about increasing political violence in a deeply polarised US.While authorities say Robinson hasn&#x27;t been cooperating with investigators, they say his family and friends have been talking.Utah Governor Spencer Cox said over the weekend that those who know Robinson say his politics shifted left in recent years and he spent a lot of time in the \"dark corners of the internet.\"FBI Director Kash Patel said agents were looking at \"anyone and everyone\" who was involved in a gaming chatroom on the social media platform Discord with Robinson. The chatroom involved \"a lot more\" than 20 people, Patel said Tuesday during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington.\"We are investigating Charlie&#x27;s assassination fully and completely and running out every lead related to any allegation of broader violence,\" Patel said in response to a question about whether the Kirk shooting was being treated as part of a broader trend of violence against religious groups.The search for a motiveInvestigators are working on finding a motive for the attack, Utah&#x27;s governor said Sunday, adding that more information may come out once Robinson appears for his initial court hearing.Cox said Robinson&#x27;s romantic partner was transgender, which some politicians have pointed to as a sign the suspect was targeting Kirk for his anti-transgender views. But authorities have not said whether that played a role.Kirk was shot while taking a question that touched on mass shootings, gun violence and transgender people.Gray declined to answer a question about whether transgender issues played a role in the motive behind Kirk&#x27;s shooting.He pointed to the charging documents, saying they summed up those points.The charges against RobinsonThe charges filed Tuesday carry two enhancements including committing several of the crimes in front of or close to children and carrying out violence based on the subject&#x27;s political beliefs.Gray declined to say whether Robinson&#x27;s roommate could face charges or whether anyone else might face charges. He also declined to say whether Robinson was cooperating or whether his parents or roommate had continued to cooperate.In the days since Kirk&#x27;s assassination, Americans have found themselves facing questions about rising political violence, the deep divisions that brought the nation here and whether anything can change.Despite calls for greater civility, some who opposed Kirk&#x27;s provocative statements about gender, race and politics criticised him after his death.Many Republicans have led the push to punish anyone they believe dishonoured him, causing both public and private workers to lose their jobs or face other consequences at work.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

The family requests privacy.\"Redford was best known for his starring roles in movies such as The Way We Were, Indecent Proposal and All the President&#x27;s Men.Redford also directed award-winning films such as Ordinary People and A River Runs Through It.The dashing actor and Oscar-winning director eschewed his status as a Hollywood leading man to champion causes close to his heart.READ MORE: Modelling agency boss pocketing money she could pay her modelsHis passion for the art of filmmaking led to his creation of the Sundance Institute, a nonprofit that supports independent film and theater and is known for its annual Sundance Film Festival.Redford was also a dedicated environmentalist, moving to the mountains of Utah in 1961 and leading efforts to preserve the natural landscape of the state and the American West.The Hollywood icon is being mourned by the industry and beyond, with President Trump even paying tribute while talking to reporters at the White House.\"Robert Redford had a series of years where there was nobody better,\" the US president said when informed of the actor&#x27;s death by a journalist.\"There was a period of time when he was the hottest. I thought he was great.\"Hilary Clinton shared a photo with the actor and her husband, former US President Bill Clinton on Instagram and remembered \"a true American icon\".\"I always admired Robert Redford, not only for his legendary career as an actor and director but for what came next,\" she wrote.\"He championed progressive values like protecting the environment and access to the arts while creating opportunities for new generations of activists and filmmakers.\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOqnggEjoYf/?utm_source=ig_embed&ampSpencer Cox, the governor of Utah, also remembered the local hero.\"He cherished our landscapes and built a legacy that made Utah a home for storytelling and creativity,\" Cox said.\"Through Sundance and his devotion to conservation, he shared Utah with the world. Today we honour his life, his vision, and his lasting contribution to our state.\"Redford acted well into his later years, reuniting with Jane Fonda in the 2017 Netflix film Our Souls at Night.The following year, he starred in The Old Man & the Gun at age 82, a film he said would be his last – although he said he would not consider retiring.\"To me, retirement means stopping something or quitting something,\" he told CBS Sunday Morning in 2018.\"There&#x27;s this life to lead, why not live it as much as you can as long as you can?\"In October 2020, Redford voiced his concern about the lack of focus on climate change in the midst of devastating wildfires in the western United States, in an opinion piece he wrote for CNN.That same month, Redford&#x27;s 58-year-old son died from cancer.David James Redford – the third of four children born to Robert Redford and former wife Lola Van Wagenen – had followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps as an activist, filmmaker and philanthropist.A restless youthBorn in Santa Monica, California, near Los Angeles, in 1936, Redford&#x27;s father worked long hours as a milkman and an accountant, later moving the family to a larger home in nearby Van Nuys.\"I didn&#x27;t see him much,\" Redford recalled of his father, on Inside the Actor&#x27;s Studio in 2005.Because his family couldn&#x27;t afford a babysitter, Redford spent hours in the children&#x27;s section at the local library where he became fascinated with books on Greek and Roman mythology.Yet Redford was hardly a model student.\"I had no patience … I was not inspired,\" Redford recalled.\"It was more interesting to me to mess around and to adventure beyond the parameters that I was growing up in.\"Drawn to arts and sports – and a life outside of sprawling Los Angeles – Redford earned a scholarship to play baseball at the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1955. That same year, his mother died.\"She was very young, she wasn&#x27;t even 40,\" he said.Redford said his mother was \"always very supportive (of my career)\" — more so than his dad.\"My father came of age during the Depression and he was afraid to take chances … so he wanted the straight and narrow path for me, which I was just not meant to be on,\" he said.\"My mother, no matter what I did, she was always forgiving and supportive and felt that I could do anything.\"When I left and went to Colorado and she died, I realised I never had a chance to thank her.\"Redford soon turned to drinking, lost his scholarship and eventually was asked to leave the university. He worked as a \"roustabout\" for the Standard Oil Company and saved his earnings to continue his art studies in Europe.\"(I) lived hand to mouth, but that was fine,\" Redford said of his time in Europe. \"I wanted that adventure. I wanted the experience of seeing what other cultures were like.\"A star is bornWhen he returned to the US, Redford began studying theatre at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City.Shy and closed off, Redford said he didn&#x27;t fit in with the other drama students who were eager to show off their acting skills.After a performance in front of his class with a fellow student that ended in frustration and disaster, Redford said his teacher pulled him aside and encouraged him to stick with acting.In 1959, Redford graduated from the academy and got his first acting role on an episode of Perry Mason. His acting career was \"uphill from there,\" he said.His big acting break came in 1963, when he starred in Neil Simon&#x27;s Barefoot in the Park on Broadway – a role he would later reprise on the big screen with Jane Fonda.Around this time, Redford married Lola Van Wagenen and started a family. His first child, Scott, died from sudden infant death syndrome just a few months after his birth in 1959. Shauna was born in 1960, David in 1962, and Amy in 1970.As his acting career was taking off, Redford and his family moved to Utah in 1961 where he bought two acres of land for just $750 ($US500) and built a cabin himself.\"I discovered how important nature was in my life, and I wanted to be where nature was extreme and where I thought it could maybe be everlasting,\" he told CNN.Redford made a name for himself as a leading man in 1969 when he starred opposite Paul Newman – already a major star – in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The Western about a pair of outlaws won four Academy Awards.Redford said he \"will forever be indebted\" to Newman, whom he credited with helping him get the role.The two actors had great on-screen chemistry, became lifelong friends and reunited in The Sting in 1973, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture.A reluctant leading manRedford starred in a string of hit movies throughout the 1970s: Jeremiah Johnson; \"The Way We Were, co-starring Barbra Streisand; The Great Gatsby; and with Dustin Hoffman in 1976&#x27;s All The President&#x27;s Men, about the Watergate scandal.Teaming up with director Sydney Pollack on Jeremiah Johnson, Redford fought with the studio to get the film made the way he wanted – a precursor to his career as a director and his support for independent filmmaking.\"It was a battle from the get-go,\" Redford told Inside The Actor&#x27;s Studio.\"They (the studio) said … &#x27;You&#x27;ve got $4 million, put it in the bank in Salt Lake City, you can shoot wherever you want, but that&#x27;s it. If it goes over, it comes out of your hide.&#x27;\"With spare dialogue and stunning scenery, the film tells the story of a Mexican War veteran who has left the battlefield to survive as a trapper in the American West.It was released more than three years after it was made because, according to Redford, the studio&#x27;s sales chief thought the film was \"so unusual\" that it wouldn&#x27;t find an audience.Jeremiah Johnson ended up grossing nearly $67 million. It wasn&#x27;t the only time Redford&#x27;s passion for the art of filmmaking put him at odds with the studios that funded his work.\"The sad thing you have to work against, as a filmmaker, is held opinions about what works or doesn&#x27;t work,\" Redford said. \"Sports movies don&#x27;t work, political movies don&#x27;t work, movies about the press don&#x27;t work – so I&#x27;ve done three of them.\"Redford made his directing debut in 1980 with Ordinary People, a drama about an unhappy suburban family which earned the Academy Award for Best Picture and another one for him as best director.He continued starring in hit films such as The Natural in 1984, which tapped into his passion for baseball, and 1993&#x27;s An Indecent Proposal, which paired him with a much younger Demi Moore.He later directed the 1993 film A River Runs Through It, which won three Academy Awards, 1994&#x27;s Quiz Show and The Horse Whisperer in 1998, which he also starred in.Ruggedly handsome, Redford was often cast as the romantic leading man in films such as Out of Africa in 1985, but he wasn&#x27;t always comfortable with the label and feared being typecast.\"I didn&#x27;t see myself the way others saw me and I was feeling kind of trapped because I couldn&#x27;t go outside the box of … good-looking leading man,\" he said.\"It was very flattering, but it was feeling restrictive … so it took many years to break loose of that.\"A lasting impactRedford&#x27;s passion for the environment and independent filmmaking merged when he founded the Sundance Institute in 1981. The nonprofit supports \"risk-taking and new voices in American film\" as well as theater, and Redford&#x27;s Sundance resort in a canyon above Provo, Utah, hosts annual workshops for playwrights and screenwriters.Each year Redford&#x27;s institute holds the Sundance Film Festival in Utah – the largest annual showcase in the United States for independent film.Many young filmmakers got their big breaks at Sundance, including Steven Soderbergh with Sex, Lies, and Videotape in 1989, Quentin Tarantino with Reservoir Dogs in 1992 and Ryan Coogler with 2013&#x27;s Fruitvale Station.Redford&#x27;s lifelong impact on the film industry was recognised in 2002 with an honorary Oscar.In his later years, Redford never lost his passion for storytelling through film and remained an outspoken champion of environmental causes. He frequently demurred when asked about retiring.\"I want to make the most of what I&#x27;ve been given,\" Redford told CNN&#x27;s Christiane Amanpour in 2015.\"You keep pushing yourself forward, you try new things and that&#x27;s invigorating.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "A judge on Tuesday dismissed terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione in New York state&#x27;s case over the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, but he kept the state&#x27;s second-degree murder charges against the Ivy League graduate.Mangione&#x27;s lawyers argued that the New York case and a parallel federal death penalty prosecution amounted to double jeopardy.But Judge Gregory Carro rejected that argument, saying it would be premature to make such a determination.READ MORE: Royals gather for historic farewell to the Duchess of Kent It’s Mangione’s first court appearance in the state case since February.The 27-year-old Ivy League graduate has attracted a cult following as a stand-in for frustrations with the health insurance industry.Dozens of his supporters showed up to his last hearing, many wearing the Luigi video game character’s green colour as a symbol of solidarity.His April arraignment in the federal case drew a similar outpouring.In his written decision, the judge said that although there is no doubt that the killing was not ordinary street crime, New York law doesn’t consider something terrorism simply because it was motivated by ideology.“While the defendant was clearly expressing an animus toward UHC, and the health care industry generally, it does not follow that his goal was to ‘intimidate and coerce a civilian population,’ and indeed, there was no evidence presented of such a goal,” Carro wrote.READ MORE: Hollywood heartthrob Robert Redford dies, aged 89 Carro scheduled pre-trial hearings in the case for December 1, which is days before Mangione is next due in court in the federal case against him.Mangione pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of murder, including murder as an act of terrorism, in the December 4, 2024, killing.Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind as he arrived for an investor conference at the New York Hilton Midtown.Police say “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were scrawled on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase commonly used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.Mangione was arrested five days later after he was spotted eating breakfast at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about about 370 kilometers west of New York City.Since then, he has been held at the same Brooklyn federal jail where Sean “Diddy” Combs is locked up.READ MORE: Brisbane man allegedly stabbed in his sleep, doused in petrol The Manhattan district attorney&#x27;s office contends that there are no double jeopardy issues because neither of Mangione’s cases has gone to trial and because the state and federal prosecutions involve different legal theories.Mangione’s lawyers say the dueling cases have created a “legal quagmire” that makes it “legally and logistically impossible to defend against them simultaneously.”The state charges, which carry a maximum of life in prison, allege that Mangione wanted to “intimidate or coerce a civilian population,” that is, insurance employees and investors.The federal charges allege that Mangione stalked Thompson and do not involve terrorism allegations.US Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in April that she was directing federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for “an act of political violence” and a “premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.”The Manhattan district attorney&#x27;s office quoted extensively from Mangione’s handwritten diary in a court filing seeking to uphold his state murder charges.They highlighted his desire to kill an insurance honcho and his praise for Ted Kaczynski, the late terrorist known as the Unabomber.In the writings, prosecutors said, Mangione mused about rebelling against “the deadly, greed fueled health insurance cartel” and said killing an industry executive “conveys a greedy bastard that had it coming.\"They also cited a confession they say he penned “To the feds,” in which he wrote that “it had to be done.”Mangione’s “intentions were obvious from his acts, but his writings serve to make those intentions explicit,” prosecutors said in the June filing.The writings, which they sometimes described as a manifesto, “convey one clear message: that the murder of Brian Thompson was intended to bring about revolutionary change to the healthcare industry.”",
