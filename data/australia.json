READ MORE: Former Greens leader Adam Bandt lands first post-politics jobThe nature of the proceedings is unknown as of this afternoon, but Lehrmann has been contacted for comment. Farrell&#x27;s office declined to comment and the National Anti-Corruption Commissioner said it was inappropriate to comment because the proceedings were before the court.Lehrmann entered into the national consciousness after he was accused of raping his colleague Brittany Higgins inside Parliament House in 2019.He has denied the claims, which remain untested in a criminal court after a 2022 trial in the ACT was abandoned because of juror misconduct. But the Federal Court found in 2024 the allegations he raped Higgins were proven on the balance of probabilities, which is a lower civil standard of proof than its criminal counterpart.READ MORE: Notorious mushroom killer Erin Patterson could walk free in her 80s Lehrmann&#x27;s appeal against his defamation loss to Network Ten and journalist Lisa Wilkinson was heard by a panel of judges in August.

Justice Michael Lee found the allegations were likely true in his headline-grabbing judgment in April 2024.\"Having escaped the lions&#x27; den, Mr Lehrmann made the mistake of going back for his hat,\" the judge quipped at the time.Support is available from the National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service at 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732).",
