          "content": "Former political staffer Bruce Lehrmann is poised to learn whether a second return to the lion&#x27;s den has overturned a court ruling he probably raped colleague Brittany Higgins.The 30-year-old suffered a bruising own-goal after suing Network Ten and journalist Lisa Wilkinson for defamation over an interview with Ms Higgins on The Project in 2021.Justice Michael Lee found Ms Higgins&#x27; claims Lehrmann had raped her inside Parliament House two years earlier were established on the balance of probabilities.READ MORE: Robert lost part of his thumb 14 years ago. It triggered a legal nightmare In his headline-grabbing decision in April 2024, the judge said: \"Having escaped the lions&#x27; den, Mr Lehrmann made the mistake of going back for his hat.\"Lehrmann appealed the finding during a two-day hearing in August, arguing the judge erred in finding Ten and Ms Wilkinson had legally justified the imputation of rape.After months of deliberations, the Full Court of the Federal Court will hand down its decision on Wednesday.The appeal judges were told Justice Lee&#x27;s factual findings differed from the case run against him, including that he had committed a \"non-violent\" rape against Ms Higgins.\"The primary judge found that the rape occurred in a particular way that wasn&#x27;t put to Mr Lehrmann in evidence, and he was taken by surprise as to the nature of the rape,\" Lehrmann&#x27;s lawyer Zali Burrows said.But the ruling depicted a violent rape, Ten&#x27;s barrister Matt Collins KC argued, labelling the suggestion that Lehrmann may have given different testimony as \"astonishing\".The former political staffer had been quizzed on the main facts of the case found by Justice Lee: that sex took place, Ms Higgins did not consent, and Lehrmann had been reckless as to her consent.\"The sting of the (defamatory) imputation resides in the act of intercourse without consent, not in any detail of it,\" Dr Collins told the appeal hearing.Both sides took issue with the definition of rape employed by Justice Lee, with Ms Burrows maintaining it was inconsistent with an ordinary person&#x27;s understanding.For their part, Ten and Ms Wilkinson urged the appeal judges to find that Lehrmann was not only reckless as to Ms Higgins&#x27; consent - as Justice Lee found - but knew she wasn&#x27;t consenting.They rejected Ms Burrows&#x27; claims that Lehrmann would be entitled to more than $20,000 in damages if his appeal is successful because he has become a \"national joke\" as a result of the allegation.Lehrmann raped Ms Higgins when he knew she was seriously intoxicated, didn&#x27;t stop when she became aware and left her in a state of undress, Dr Collins argued.\"That is not a man with any reputation in respect of sexual morality that would warrant compensation,\" he said.Lehrmann denies he sexually assaulted Ms Higgins and a criminal case against him in 2022 was abandoned without any findings against him.1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732)National Sexual Abuse and Redress Support Service 1800 211 028",

The media was ultimately \"disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner.\"And the White House TikTok account posted a video using Taylor Swift&#x27;s song \"The Fate of Ophelia\" with images of Trump administration officials.However, Swift – whom Trump has personally attacked in the past – has stayed quiet on the use of the song. When the White House used the song last month, the singer&#x27;s representative did not respond to CNN&#x27;s request for comment.Celine Dion, the Foo Fighters, Bruce Springsteen and Beyoncé are among the artists over the years who have objected to the use of their music by Trump.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
