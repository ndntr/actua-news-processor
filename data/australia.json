I&#x27;ve just heard that again.\"A friend has lost his 12-year-old daughter, who succumbed to her wounds in hospital.\"Chabad is an international movement of ultra-Orthodox Judaism known for its public candle lightings in communities across the world.Chabad.org also named two other victims: Reuven Morrison, a member of the Chabad community; and Alex Kleytman, a Holocaust survivor.French citizen among victims A French national has been identified as one of the victims of yesterday&#x27;s Bondi Beach shooting in Sydney&#x27;s east.French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement posted on X the citizen was Dan Elkayam.\"It is with deep sadness that I learned of the death of our compatriot Dan Elkayam in the anti-Semitic terrorist attack in Sydney. \"My thoughts are with his family and loved ones, and I express to them the full solidarity of the nation.\"READ MORE: Albanese says &#x27;justice will be done&#x27; after &#x27;evil&#x27; attack at Bondi BeachFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the country was mourning with Elkayam, and described the shooting that left at least 16 people dead as \"despicable\". \"We mourn with his family and loved ones, with the grieving Jewish community and the Australian people,\" Barrot said in a statement posted to X.\"This despicable act is yet another tragic manifestation of a revolting surge of antisemitic hatred that we must thwart.\"\"France will spare no effort to root out antisemitism wherever it emerges, and to combat terrorism in all its forms.\"The Le Parisien newspaper reports that Elkayam, a Jew, was 27 and had moved to Australia about a year ago to work as an engineer.If you have been impacted by the terror attack in Bondi there is support available.

Another 40 have been injured.WATCH: Hero wrestles gun from attacker One of the gunmen is dead and the second is in hospital. Netanyahu, who previously castigated Albanese for his government&#x27;s support of a Palestinian state, claimed he had warned the Australian leader he was pouring \"fuel on the antisemitic fire\".\"I called upon you to replace weakness with action, appeasement with resolve,\" Netanyahu said in a video posted on the Israeli prime minister&#x27;s official X account.\"Instead, prime minister, you replaced weakness with weakness and appeasement with more appeasement.\"Netanyahu also said he \"saluted\" the \"great man\" who tackled one of the terrorists and disarmed him.Australia was among several countries formally recognising a Palestinian state in September during the United Nations gathering of world leaders.Israel&#x27;s Foreign Minister Gideon Sa&#x27;ar was equally critical of the Australian government. \"Western governments face a simple choice: fight antisemitism or normalise it,\" Sa&#x27;ar said.\"The Australian government has failed this test. Even compared to the Western countries, the wave of antisemitism that has swept it, both in the virtual space and in the public sphere, is immense. It is, of course, not the only one that has failed.\"Sa&#x27;ar said there has been \"a surge in antisemitism in Australia\".READ MORE: PM says &#x27;justice will be done&#x27; \" I also said that security for the Jewish community in Australia will be achieved only through a real change in the public atmosphere,\" he said.\"Calls such as &#x27;Globalise the Intifada,&#x27; &#x27;From the River to the Sea Palestine Will be Free,&#x27; and &#x27;Death to the IDF&#x27; are not legitimate, are not part of the freedom of speech, and inevitably lead to what we witnessed today.\"Albanese did not respond directly to Netanyahu&#x27;s comments when asked at a media conference this morning.\"This is a moment for national unity,\" Albanese said.\"This is a moment for Australians to come together. That&#x27;s precisely what we&#x27;ll be doing.\"According to the Palestinian Foreign Ministry, 159 countries have recognised Palestine.The vast majority of the international community believes that a two-state solution is the only way to end decades of conflict.Netanyahu&#x27;s government has said the international push for a Palestinian state rewards Hamas.READ MORE: Rabbi identified as victim of Bondi Beach shooting attackHere are some global reactions to the Australia shooting:IranIran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said that “terrorism and the killing of people, wherever they occur, are unacceptable and must be condemned.”Australia in August cut off diplomatic relations with Iran and accused it of masterminding antisemitic arson attacks in Sydney and Melbourne.United StatesPresident Donald Trump called the shooting \"a purely antisemitic attack\", and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that \"antisemitism has no place in this world\".BritainKing Charles III said he was \"appalled and saddened\".He also leads the Commonwealth, and the office of Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Sunday said Herzog had reached out to the king in September warning of an \"epidemic of antisemitism\" in three Commonwealth countries: Britain, Canada and Australia.Meanwhile, police in London said they would step up security at Jewish sites.GermanyGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the attack \"has left me speechless\" and added that \"this is an attack on our shared values\".\"We must stop this antisemitism, here in Germany and worldwide,\" he said.United NationsSecretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was horrified and that \"my heart is with the Jewish community worldwide on this first day of Hannukah, a festival celebrating the miracle of peace and light vanquishing darkness\".IndiaIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the “ghastly terrorist attack” and said that “we stand in solidarity with the people of Australia in this hour of grief.”World Jewish CongressThe organisation&#x27;s president, Ronald Lauder, said that “no community should ever fear ​coming together to celebrate its faith, traditions, or identity,” adding: “Make no mistake, this will not break us.\"READ MORE: What we know about the two Bondi Beach gunmenREAD MORE: Bloodied witness describes chaos LIVE UPDATES: Bondi shooting latest news - reported with Associated Press DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
