It was just like on television!\"A 16-year-old girl was accused of punching one officer in the face, then kicking another in the knee.Randy Hill, 21, fronted court today, charged with disorderly behaviour, obstructing a public officer and drug possession.Some neighbours say at one point a stream of about 200 teenagers walked down the road to get to the party.They&#x27;d come from the recently opened Byford train station about a kilometre away.The same group left a trail of smashed bottles and broken fences when asked to leave.Residents and partiers picked up the pieces, with the street still littered with bottles, cans and discarded Halloween costumes.It was a night of thrills and spills that won&#x27;t soon be forgotten.
