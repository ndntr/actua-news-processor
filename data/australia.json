Virgin Australia chief operations officer Chris Snook said the policy change was motivated by safety and compliance with international standards.\"Globally, more lithium battery-powered devices are now being carried by travellers, and while these items are generally safe when packed and handled appropriately, this move will minimise any potential risks associated with these devices,\" he said, in a statement. READ MORE: Airline rules on portable chargers explained \"The changes to the policy will be permanent from 1 December and reflect our safety-first approach.\"The Australian airlines aren&#x27;t going it alone. Several international carriers including Emirates, Singapore Airlines and Vietnam Airlines have banned the use of power banks on board, and the US Federal Aviation Administration warned airlines of lithium batteries in September.A battery pack was found to be the possible cause of a fire that engulfed an Air Busan plane waiting for takeoff in January and a Delta Air Lines flight from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale in July when smoke and flames started pouring out of a backpack due to the same culprit.READ MORE: NSW Opposition Leader Mark Speakman quits after colleagues turn against himOther fire incidents reportedly linked to batter packs include a fire on a Virgin Australia flight in July and the evacuation of the Qantas lounge in Melbourne when a man&#x27;s battery caught alight early this month.\"Hoping the man who caught fire holding it is ok,\" Australian film producer and Women in Film and Television Australia producer Leanne Tonks posted on Instagram.\"Quick thinking from the man who jumped in to help and the staff who got him in the shower and everyone else out of the lounge.\"FAA fire safety branch manager Robert Ochs said lithium batteries could go into something called \"thermal runaway\". READ MORE: Trump signs bill to release Jeffrey Epstein case files\"All of a sudden, it&#x27;ll start to short circuit … It will get warmer and warmer and warmer until the structure of the battery itself fails,\" he said.\"At that point, it can eject molten electrolyte and flames and smoke and toxic gas.\"Both Qantas and Virgin Australia will ban power banks larger than 160 watt-hours, which is enough to charge a recent MacBook Air about three times.Power banks are commonly marketed based on their milliamp hours (mAh), which measures capacity but they should all list their energy in watt-hours too.A fairly standard 3.7V power with 160 watt-hours should equate to roughly 43,000 milliamp hours, according to popular accessories manufacturer Anker.Qantas&#x27; power bank policy changes starting on December 15 are:No use of power banksNo charging of power banksMaximum of two power banks per personMaximum of 160 watt hours (Wh) in totalCustomers may carry up to two power banks (each not exceeding a maximum capacity of 160 watt hours) in their cabin baggage.Power banks, spare batteries and personal electronic devices should be stored in the seat pocket or under the seat in front, or in a nearby overhead locker. All power banks must display battery specifications.\"Smart bag\" lithium batteries must be removed and treated like power banks.Virgin&#x27;s Qantas&#x27; power bank policy changes starting on December 1 are: Guests shouldn&#x27;t stow not stow power banks, spare batteries and small portable electronic devices in the overhead locker and must store them under the seat in front or on themPower banks can&#x27;t be used, limiting charging to the in-seat portsEach guest may carry a maximum of two power banks.
