This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.\"Law enforcement investigating Nancy&#x27;s disappearance have confirmed they had received some demands for ransom from different sources, but have not said if any of them are considered credible.Authorities also say they are unaware of any ongoing communication between the Guthries and any purported kidnappers.Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for paying have passed.READ MORE: David sold his home for $2 after &#x27;traumatic&#x27; new rule forced him outThe FBI last week released chilling CCTV footage of a masked suspect on Nancy&#x27;s porch.The images and video show a man wearing gloves, long sleeves, pants, and with a balaclava over his face, apparently attempting to block the door camera at the home , including by holding up a handful of plants.A glove appearing to match the footage from Nancy&#x27;s home was later found around three kilometres away and has been sent for DNA testing.The FBI said in a statement that it received preliminary results on Saturday and was awaiting official confirmation.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
