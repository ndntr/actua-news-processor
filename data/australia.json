The 48-year-old man has been taken into custody following a dramatic arrest involving tactical crews and an airwing after two alleged aggravated carjackings in Tarneit in the city&#x27;s west and North Melbourne.It is alleged the man was travelling with his wife when he walked into a convenience store at the intersection of Sayers and Tarneit roads about 7.45am today after the car he was driving ran out of fuel.READ MORE: Whip-sawing temperatures to see millions bake while others freezeHe allegedly approached the attendant and attempted to take a jerry can to obtain fuel before assaulting the worker and leaving on foot, police say. The shop worker sustained minor injuries.The man then allegedly approached the owner of a silver Honda Civic a nd pointed his gun at the driver and demanded he give up the car.The driver refused and ran into a nearby shop.A Mitsubishi ASX wagon – which was stopped behind the Honda – was then allegedly carjacked by the armed offender.Police said the man pointed a gun at the driver&#x27;s head before taking off in the car.The driver was not injured in the incident. Acting Inspector Emma Lobb told reporters earlier that a police airwing followed the man as he drove \"erratically\" towards North Melbourne.There, he allegedly carjacked another person at gunpoint and stole a silver Hyundai sedan.\"Once in the city he dumped that vehicle around Lonsdale Street, our critical incident and SOG was deployed and they&#x27;ve safely the secured the arrest of the offender,\" Lobb said.After dumping the car on Lonsdale Street, the man headed on foot.9News has obtained CCTV vision of the man smoking while appearing to carry a gun as he walked down the street.Specialist and tactical members from the Special Operations Group and Critical Incident Response Team arrested him shortly after.A firearm was taken and the man will be interviewed by detectives today.\"This coordinated response led to the matter being resolved within an hour, and thankfully, no serious injuries to members of the public or police,\" Detective Senior Sergeant Luke Flint said.\"However, it must be acknowledged there were alleged victims and witnesses who will be significantly impacted by this.\"Victorians deserve to feel safe in their own community and we will continue to do everything possible to prevent crime from occurring and when it unfortunately does happen, bring an abrupt end to offending so no one else is harmed.\"A witness told 9News the alleged offender almost hit pedestrians as he drove through the busy CBD at peak hour.\"Then he just was driving and almost hit this poor lady,\" he said.\"I had to run and grab her and move her out of the way.\"Another bystander said he saw the alleged offender \"waving a gun\" before police swooped.\" I came out of the bathroom and then all of a sudden I see this guy in a maroon jacket sort of waving a gun at me,\" he said.\"So I sort of froze, looked at him, and then I just took off and I just ran out of the foyer.\"One witness recalled seeing police draw their guns in response to the incident.\" I saw him coming out of the coffee shop as I was going in,\" he told 9News.\"I went in, got a coffee, turned around, and before I knew it there was felt like 20 police guns drawn.\"READ MORE: Joy, relief and jubilation as Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners and detainees given freedomLobb said the man was armed but had \"no intention\" to hurt people. \"Yes, there was a firearm on the male however this has been recovered and there is absolutely no issues with safety regarding members of the puiblic,\" she added.She said the man sustained injuries while being arrested and is being assessed at Royal Melbourne Hospital, where he remains under police guard.The alleged offender&#x27;s wife was not injured.Lobb also praised police for their \"fantastic response\" to the incident.
