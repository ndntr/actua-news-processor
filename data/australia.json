          "content": "The bombshell trove of documents from the estate of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein have lit a political bonfire in the US, with one email recording the sex offender telling somebody, \"I know how dirty Donald is\".The \"Donald\" he spoke of was at that time in 2018, as he is now, the US president and Commander-in-Chief, Donald J Trump.Here&#x27;s what has been gleaned from the files so far.READ MORE: Crisis engulfs White House as Trump pressures allies&#x27;I know how dirty Donald is&#x27;The newly released documents don&#x27;t provide any smoking guns when it comes to evidence of wrongdoing by Trump. But there are suggestions throughout that Epstein knew things about Trump that could hurt him.In one 2018 email, Epstein remarked amid a discussion about Trump&#x27;s possible impeachment: \"you see , i know how dirty Donald is. my guess is that non lawyers ny biz people have no idea. What it means to have your fixer flip.\" (That last part was apparently a reference to Michael Cohen, who flipped on Trump.)After Trump won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, a correspondent wondered to Epstein about \"the stories you could tell,\" according to one of the released email exchanges.READ MORE: Former prince&#x27;s name changes again after royal decree found After the correspondent wagered that such information might not actually damage Trump, Epstein seemed to reference how Trump was \"a phony rich person.\"Epstein told the same person months earlier that he could produce photos \"of donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen.\"He also told the person that he at one point \"gave\" his 20-year-old girlfriend to Trump, in the mid-1990s.At other points in Epstein&#x27;s correspondence, author Michael Wolff seems to try and convince Epstein to come forward and say something about Trump.\"There&#x27;s an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner your great sympathy and help finish him,\" Wolff told Epstein days before the 2016 election. \"Interested?\"Trump has never been accused of wrongdoing in the Epstein case and has denied involvement in Epstein&#x27;s crimes. The White House this morning said the emails \"prove absolutely nothing, other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.\"READ MORE: Trump urges Netanyahu pardon, sparking concerns over US influence Emails reignite questions about what Trump knew and whenThere have remained huge unanswered questions about what Trump knew and when about Epstein&#x27;s proclivities. That&#x27;s especially given Trump&#x27;s explanations have often proved evasive or false.The White House responded to the initial three emails mentioning Trump by arguing Democrats had \"selectively leaked\" the emails to \"create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.\"But these emails certainly deepen the intrigue about what Trump knew.To recap what we already knew: Trump in 2002 referred to how Epstein liked women \"on the younger side.\" A Florida businessman said in a 2019 interview that he raised concerns with Trump about Epstein \"going after younger girls\" at a 1992 \"calendar girl\" event.Trump adviser Roger Stone in a 2016 book quoted Trump talking about how Epstein&#x27;s \"swimming pool was full of beautiful young girls\" and joking that it was nice of Epstein to \"let the neighborhood kids use his pool.\"The president and his aides have also repeatedly said Trump distanced himself from Epstein because Epstein was a \"creep\" – but without elaborating on why, precisely, Trump viewed him as such.Beyond that, Trump this summer acknowledged being aware of Epstein&#x27;s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell recruiting employees, including the former Prince Andrew&#x27;s accuser Virginia Giuffre, at Mar-a-Lago – but he seemed to be quite reluctant to go into detail.The question from there was whether Trump had an inkling about what Giuffre was being recruited for.Trump said he didn&#x27;t \"know really why\" Epstein Maxwell was recruiting people. (Maxwell has denied recruiting people.) But Giuffre was a minor. To the extent Trump was aware of the particulars of the situation – and was aware of Epstein&#x27;s taste for young females – that would seem to raise red flags.\"It makes us ask if he was aware of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell&#x27;s criminal actions,\" Giuffre&#x27;s two brothers and her sisters-in-law said in a statement this summer.The 2019 Epstein email released by the committee says of Trump: \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.\"That doesn&#x27;t prove Trump knew what Maxwell and Epstein were recruiting the girls for. But it suggests that Trump was involved in telling Maxwell to knock it off and was seemingly familiar with the details of the situation.The 2011 Epstein email that suggests Giuffre \"spent hours\" at his house with Trump also adds to the relevant facts here.When Trump was acknowledging his awareness of Maxwell&#x27;s recruiting at Mar-a-Lago, he initially said he didn&#x27;t know if it was Giuffre who had been recruited. But then he quickly said that it was indeed her.If Trump actually spent time with Giuffre, as Epstein&#x27;s email seems to say, it would not only raise questions about why. It would also make Trump&#x27;s handling of the situation appear even more bizarre.And it&#x27;s clear from Giuffre&#x27;s own memoir that they knew each other and had had conversations about her working for his friends.\"Trump couldn&#x27;t have been friendlier, telling me it was fantastic that I was there,\" Giuffre writes about the time that her father took her to meet Trump in his office. She goes on to recount that Trump asked her if she liked children and explained that he had friends in houses \"next to the resort\" who needed babysitting for their kids.Giuffre did not accuse Trump of any wrongdoing in her recent posthumously-published memoir. The emails undercut Maxwell&#x27;s attempts to distance Trump from EpsteinThe Trump Justice Department decided to interview Maxwell, a convicted sex offender, this summer while her appeals were ongoing. It did so despite her established credibility problems and motivations to say what the administration wanted.(Trump at the time hadn&#x27;t ruled out the possibility of pardoning Maxwell. And around this time, we also learned Maxwell had been moved to a lower-security prison camp for which she didn&#x27;t appear eligible as a sex offender. The administration still hasn&#x27;t explained how this happened, months later.)And sure enough, Maxwell said things that were helpful to the president. She basically said she had no knowledge of any Trump wrongdoing and downplayed his relationship with Epstein.But the new emails call her claims into question.Speaking of Trump&#x27;s and Epstein&#x27;s relationship, Maxwell said in her testimony, the transcript of which was released in August: \"I don&#x27;t think they were close friends, or I certainly never witnessed the president in any of – I don&#x27;t recall ever seeing him in his house, for instance.\"But the newly released emails suggest Maxwell was aware of Trump being at Epstein&#x27;s house, at least as of 2011.After Epstein in the email referenced someone spending \"hours at my house\" with Trump, Maxwell responds, \"I have been thinking about that.\"Maxwell&#x27;s attorney didn&#x27;t immediately respond to a request for comment.This is not the first Maxwell claim from that interview that has been called into question.Epstein and Maxwell seemed to think this information about Trump was significantWe surely need to learn more about the context of these emails. But one of the biggest takeaways is that they suggest Epstein and Maxwell seemed to feel this information about Trump was significant. There&#x27;s even a hint they suggested that information could be used as leverage.The timelines are important here.The 2011 email came as news was blowing up about Epstein&#x27;s ties to Prince Andrew, as he was then known. (He was recently stripped of his noble title.) As CNN has reported, around this time Epstein seemed to be going into legal attack mode.Prince Andrew&#x27;s most prominent accuser was Giuffre.It was in this context that Epstein and Maxwell conversed about Trump having spent time at Epstein&#x27;s house with someone who, according to Republicans, is identified in the email as Giuffre.And notably, Epstein described Trump as the \"dog that hasn&#x27;t barked.\" This is an expression that comes from Sherlock Holmes mysteries; it basically means the absence of an expected event.Which leads to the obvious question: Why might Epstein and Maxwell have expected news about Trump to have come out?The timeline of the 2019 email is also relevant. That&#x27;s because it came during Trump&#x27;s first term as his administration was weighing significant action vis-à-vis Epstein.The Miami Herald had in late 2018 run a major exposé on the sweetheart deal Epstein received from US Attorney Alexander Acosta, who later became Trump&#x27;s labor secretary. By early 2019, a major question was whether the Justice Department would probe that deal.The DOJ&#x27;s inspector general said on January 30 of that year that he didn&#x27;t have the power to examine the situation. But by February 6 the DOJ&#x27;s Office of Professional Responsibility signaled that it had opened an investigation.CNN reported at the time that multiple authorities were reviewing allegations about Epstein and minors as of early that year.It was in this context, on January 31, that Epstein emailed Wolff about Trump \"of course\" being aware of Maxwell&#x27;s recruitment at Mar-a-Lago.The newly released emails also include a 2015 Epstein exchange with Wolff in which the two of them strategise about how then-candidate Trump should handle questions about his ties to Epstein. Wolff said he had heard CNN was going to ask Trump about it at the debate, either on air or after. (There is no mention of Epstein in the transcript of the debate.)In that email, Wolff suggests the best course would be to \"let him hang himself\" by denying being on Epstein&#x27;s plane or his house.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "A chorus of \"Nazi scum, off our streets\" has been shouted by protesters as a white supremacist group leader walked from court after securing bail. Thomas Sewell, 32, was granted bail by a judge today after he was found not to be an unacceptable risk to endangering community safety and had presented compelling reasons to be freed. It was his second attempt at bail after a Melbourne magistrate denied his release about two months ago.READ MORE: What emails show about Trump-Epstein link Sewell is charged with 25 offences for two incidents in August, including allegedly leading a group attack on August 31 on a sacred First Nations site where several people were assaulted. He is accused of punching a member of Camp Sovereignty in the collar bone, kicking another occupant and discharging a missile at the camp. Sewell is further accused of raising his fists and lunging at a man on August 9 as he and 200 others marched through Melbourne with \"white man fight back\" banners. The man allegedly spat on Sewell, who is accused of retaliating and trading blows before overpowering the man who was tackled by other members of Sewell&#x27;s group and kicked in the head. Prosecutors opposed Sewell&#x27;s release in Melbourne&#x27;s Supreme Court, citing his unacceptable risk of re-offending as the leader of a group with a \"history of hate crimes and acts of violence\".READ MORE: Machete found in car allegedly speeding at 200km/h through Melbourne suburb Sewell&#x27;s group, the National Socialist Network, had a tendency to \"act violently to vulnerable groups, including ethnic minorities\", prosecutors said. Prosecutor Erik Dober said Sewell&#x27;s offending was serious as he told a group of about 30 men dressed in black \"let&#x27;s get &#x27;em\" and led them towards the camp at King&#x27;s Domain, a sacred site for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. He said Sewell had failed to show compelling reasons under the Bail Act to allow his release. Sewell&#x27;s barrister, top silk Dermot Dann KC, listed a number of reasons his client should be freed on bail including that any risk to the community could be addressed with bail conditions. Dann said if Sewell remained locked up until he faced trial, which could take two years, he may end up serving more time on remand than he is sentenced to.READ MORE: Cancelling a gym membership? These are your consumer rights in Australia Justice James Elliott agreed with the defence as he approved Sewell&#x27;s release, finding the prosecution did not demonstrate he posed an unacceptable risk to endangering the safety of the community. Sewell, who had spent 72 days in custody, was bailed on a $20,000 surety, which his partner will have to forfeit if he breaches any bail conditions. He will have to abide by an 18-month Community Corrections order, which was handed to him by a magistrate in September after she found him guilty of intimidating a police officer and his wife. Sewell will be restricted to a curfew from 9pm to 6am every day, must not contact any co-accused or witnesses for the prosecution, and cannot enter Melbourne&#x27;s CBD except for legal or medical reasons. He is banned from going within 200 metres of King&#x27;s Domain and cannot leave Victoria. Among his reasons for granting bail, the judge said Sewell had stable accommodation with his fiancee and two children, and faced \"extremely onerous conditions\" in protection while on remand. As Sewell walked from court on Thursday afternoon, a small group of pro-immigration protesters chanted \"Nazi scum off our streets\". Sewell will return to Melbourne Magistrates Court for a committal mention on December 9.",
