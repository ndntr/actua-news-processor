          "standfirst": "The House Oversight Committee released a trove of records from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein, including a note bearing President Donald Trump&#x27;s name.",
          "content": "The House Oversight Committee released a trove of records from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein, including a note bearing President Donald Trump&#x27;s name that was part of a collection of letters gifted to the late convicted sex offender for his 50th birthday.In addition to the \"birthday book,\" the records included Epstein&#x27;s last will and testament, entries from his address book, and the 2007 non-prosecution agreement between Epstein and the US Attorney&#x27;s Office for the Southern District of Florida.Ahead of the public release of all the records, Democrats on the committee posted on X an image of the page from the so-called birthday book with Trump&#x27;s name. READ MORE: Lewd letter to paedophile Epstein comes back to haunt TrumpThe president has repeatedly denied writing the letter and sued The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on it, for defamation.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X following the release that \"it&#x27;s very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it. President Trump&#x27;s legal team will continue to aggressively pursue litigation.\"In a separate post, White House deputy chief of staff for communications Taylor Budowich also denied that Trump had signed Epstein&#x27;s book and shared several images with the president&#x27;s signature.The signature on the document closely resembles images circulating online of Trump&#x27;s signature on other documents, in particular when Trump signs only his first name.The panel has been investigating the Epstein case and had subpoenaed the estate for documents as part of its on-going probe. The investigation comes amid a push – including from within the president&#x27;s own party – for more transparency around the case and the release of more information.Democrats on the committee also highlighted what they said was another page from the \"birthday book\" — a letter with a photo that they described as \"Epstein and a longtime Mar-a-Lago member joking about selling a &#x27;fully depreciated&#x27; woman to Donald Trump for $22,500.\"The partially redacted photo shows Epstein standing next to several other people holding an oversized cheque written to appear that it had been made out from Trump to Epstein for US$22,500 ($A34,000). The committee did not identify the other people in the photo. Below the photo, a hand-written caption states, \"Jeffrey showing early talents with money and women! Sells &#x27;fully depreciated&#x27; [readacted] to Donald Trump for $22,500.\"CNN has reached out to the White House to request comment. In a statement, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer blasted Democrats for selectively making materials public before he released the entire trove, and added that he would pursue \"additional Epstein bank records\" based on what was already turned over.\"It&#x27;s appalling Democrats on the Oversight Committee are cherry-picking documents and politicising information received from the Epstein Estate today,\" Comer said. \"Oversight Committee Republicans are focused on running a thorough investigation to bring transparency and accountability for survivors of Epstein&#x27;s heinous crimes and the American people. President Trump is not accused of any wrongdoing and Democrats are ignoring the new information the Committee received today.\"Contents of &#x27;birthday book&#x27;The now-famous \"birthday book\" is a 238-page collection of photos, yearbook pages, song sheets and other mementos. It was compiled by Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who wrote in the prologue that she wanted to \"gather stories and old photographs to jog your memory about places, people and different events.\"\"Some of the letters will definitely achieve their intended goal. Some well … you will have to read them to see for yourself. I know you will enjoy looking through the book, and I hope you will derive as much pleasure looking through it as I did putting it together for you,\" Maxwell wrote.In the book&#x27;s contents section, under a header titled \"FRIENDS,\" there is a list of more than 20 names, including former President Bill Clinton, attorney Alan Dershowitz, and Trump. Under a header titled \"GIRL-FRIENDS,\" the names are all redacted.The trove includes a letter that appears to be from Clinton wishing Epstein a \"Happy 50th.\" A spokesman referred to a previous statement that Clinton cut ties before Epstein&#x27;s arrest on federal charges in 2019 and didn&#x27;t know about Epstein&#x27;s crimes.It also includes a note that appears to be on letterhead from Dershowitz, saying, \"Happy birthday and best regards.\"For his tribute, Dershowitz appears to have created a fake magazine cover, which he called \"Vanity Unfair,\" in which he doctored headlines to fit Epstein&#x27;s name, including doctoring a cover story about Nicole Kidman. The note states, \"As a birthday gift to you, I managed to obtain an early version\" of the magazine.CNN has reached out to Dershowitz for comment. Dershowitz told the Wall Street Journal, \"It&#x27;s been a long time and I don&#x27;t recall the content of what I may have written.\"The book&#x27;s contents spanned Epstein&#x27;s life before 50, from birth and Cub Scout documents to photos of art in his expensive private residences and black-and-white family portraits. It also included extensive notes and photos about private moments and jokes.There are several pages of lewd notes with titles such as \"Girls on my boat,\" where the names of women appear to be redacted.The records released by the committee also include pages from Epstein&#x27;s address book, which contained contact information for many of the wealthy and powerful people in his orbit. A version of the book that redacted phone numbers or email addresses had previously been made publicHouse panel expected to receive more estate recordsAttorney Daniel H. Weiner, a representative for the estate, confirmed to CNN that an initial document production had been transmitted to the panel and said \"the Co-Executors will continue to produce on a rolling basis documents responsive to the Committee&#x27;s subpoena.\"Lawyers representing the estate noted in a letter obtained by CNN accompanying the document production that there are certain redactions in the book, which was reportedly compiled by Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, that comprises three volumes.\"Please note that, in an abundance of caution, we have redacted names and faces of women and minors who appear in the book (other than Ms. Maxwell, public figures, and family or class photos) to ensure that no potential victims are publicly identifiable,\" Weiner and attorney Daniel Ruzumna wrote.\"We have also redacted photographs revealing any nudity from the book,\" they added.In response to the committee&#x27;s request for \"a potential list of clients involved in sex, sex acts, or sex trafficking facilitated by Mr. Jeffrey Epstein,\" in the subpoena, lawyers for Epstein&#x27;s estate said they \"are not aware of the existence\" of such a list.As CNN previously reported, a bipartisan group of staffers on the committee is expected to travel to New York City later this week to meet with lawyers representing the estate and view unredacted documents related to the investigation.The committee previously released tens of thousands of pages of documents of Epstein files turned over to the panel by the Justice Department. Democrats on the panel criticised that document production, however, saying that it contained little new information.READ MORE: Trump jeers &#x27;destructive&#x27; Tom Hanks after US military cancels awardDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

He filed a US$10 billion ($15.1 billion) lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for a report on the alleged letter.The letter was included as part of a 2003 album compiled for alleged sex trafficker Epstein&#x27;s birthday. The president has denied having anything to do with it. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee received a copy of the birthday album on Monday as part of a batch of documents from Epstein&#x27;s estate.READ MORE: Appeals court upholds $126 million defamation judgment against President TrumpThe White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.After the letter was released, White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich posted pictures on X of Trump&#x27;s signature and tagged The Wall Street Journal&#x27;s parent corporation, News Corp, writing: \"Time for @newscorp to open that checkbook, it&#x27;s not his signature.

Also, I don&#x27;t draw pictures,\" Trump said.The letter released by the committee looks exactly as described by the The Wall Street Journal in its report.The letter bearing Trump&#x27;s name and signature includes text framed by a hand-drawn outline of what appears to be a curvaceous woman.READ MORE: Notorious mushroom killer Erin Patterson could walk free in her 80s \"A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret,\" the letter says.The letter&#x27;s disclosure comes amid a bipartisan push in Congress for the release of the so-called Epstein files amid years of speculation and conspiracy theories. Calls for the release of the records came from Republicans, including Vice President JD Vance before he was sworn into the country&#x27;s second-highest office.Epstein, a wealthy and well-connected financier, killed himself in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019 on charges that said he sexually abused and trafficked dozens of underage girls.The case was brought more than a decade after he secretly cut a deal with federal prosecutors in Florida to dispose of nearly identical allegations.Epstein was accused of paying underage girls hundreds of dollars in cash for massages and then molesting them.Trump&#x27;s ties to Epstein have been well-documented, though he said they had a falling-out two decades ago. He has said he kicked the financier out of his private club in Florida after Epstein betrayed him more than once by hiring people who had worked for him.The president has not been accused of misconduct in connection with their social relationship.The Justice Department in August began turning over records from the Epstein sex trafficking investigation to the House Oversight Committee.The committee subpoenaed the Epstein estate for documents last month. In addition to the birthday book, lawmakers requested Epstein&#x27;s last will and testament, agreements he signed with prosecutors, his contact books, and his financial transactions and holdings.Support is available from the National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service at 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732).Readers seeking support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or beyond blue on 1300 22 4636.",

          "content": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has urged Liberal Senator Jacinta Price to apologise to the Indian community, as more of her colleagues distance themselves from her remarks about migration.Price accused the federal government of allowing more migrants in from \"particular countries over others\" to skew votes and singled out the Indian community during an interview with the ABC last week.She later walked back her statement and said: \"Australia maintains a longstanding and bipartisan non-discriminatory migration policy. Suggestions otherwise are a mistake.\"READ MORE: Staff at university &#x27;utterly furious&#x27; as chancellor defends job cuts processBut her refusal to apologise has caused internal dissent and put pressure on Opposition Leader Sussan Ley, who promised to rebuild relationships with multicultural communities and women after the party&#x27;s historic defeat at the federal election in May.The remarks came days after anti-immigration rallies, some of which targeted Indian Australians, were held across the country on August 31. Albanese called on Price to apologise for the hurt her comments have caused and threw his support behind the community that he said has \"made our nation stronger\".\"The comments are not true that the senator made, and of course she should apologise for the hurt that has been caused, and her own colleagues are saying that, but even more importantly, leaders in the community are asking for that as well,\" he told the ABC today. Nationals Senator Bridget McKenzie has also urged Price to apologise, while Liberal MP Julian Leeser apologised on her behalf during an event at a Hindi language school in his north-west Sydney electorate of Berowra.READ MORE: Banks threaten to hike credit card fees, cut rewards over surcharge ban\"I wanted just to say something, and it pains me to say it, but I feel I have to say it,\" he said in a video posted to social media yesterday.\"My colleague, Jacinta Price, said something this week that I want to apologise unreservedly for. \"As my leader, Sussan Ley, said, she was wrong to say it, and she has walked back those remarks, and I am pleased that she has.\"Let me say very clearly, the contribution of Indian Australians to this country is fantastic. \"The Indian community is fantastic. India, like Australia, is a democracy.\"There are Indians that vote Labor, there are Indians that vote Liberal, there are Indians that vote Greens. I don&#x27;t care how you vote. I care about the contribution you make to this country, and I know it is a fantastic contribution, and I want you to keep making it.\"READ MORE: Are shark attacks on the rise and what can we do to stop them?Senior Liberal and manager of opposition business Alex Hawke has also publicly said he had advised Price to apologise.But that account was rejected by Price, who accused Hawke of \"cowardly and inappropriate conduct\" by berating her staff and threatening her position within the Liberal Party.\"If people want to talk about a so-called &#x27;woman problem&#x27; in the Liberal Party, then it&#x27;s this: we don&#x27;t stand up for women when they are mistreated by our own colleagues,\" she wrote in a fiery statement on Sunday. Price has defied calls to apologise as recently as last night, when she instead urged Ley to make Hawke say sorry for his actions.READ MORE: Aussie retail giant fined $13.5 million after misleading promotion\"I have asked our leader if she would ask Alex Hawke to apologise to me for his conduct,\" she told Sky News.\"I&#x27;m a Liberal woman, and Liberal women need to be able to feel like they&#x27;re being supported wholeheartedly. \"Over the weekend, Ley toured Little India, also known as Harris Park in Sydney, alongside Leeser, shadow immigration minister Paul Scarr and NSW Opposition Leader Mark Speakman as she worked to restore the party&#x27;s relationship with the community.She said Price was wrong to say those remarks, but remained tight-lipped on whether she spoke to Price or asked her to apologise.She has also refused to apologise on her behalf.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
