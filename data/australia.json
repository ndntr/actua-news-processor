          "content": "U S President Donald Trump has pardoned two Thanksgiving turkeys at the White House in characteristic style, slipping in digs at his political rivals such as predecessor Joe Biden.This year&#x27;s turkey pardon, a presidential tradition dating back decades and which has been de rigeur since 1989, saw Trump wield his clemency powers to spare the lives of Waddle and Gobble and save them from the Thanksgiving table.Only Gobble was present for the ceremony itself, though Waddle made an earlier appearance in the White House briefing room alongside press secretary Karoline Leavitt.READ MORE: Man dresses as dead mother in Mrs Doubtfire scheme to collect pension \"Waddle, want to give us a gobble?\" Leavitt asked. The turkey obliged.\"Very on message!\" Leavitt said.At the main event, Trump stood next to Gobble alongside First Lady Melania Trump. READ MORE: Brothers discover comic book worth $14.1 million in late mother&#x27;s home \"Gobble, I just want to tell you this – very important – you are hereby unconditionally pardoned,\" Trump said, drawing applause from the Rose Garden crowd following remarks.He then reached over to give the plump bird a pet.\"Who would want to harm this beautiful bird,\" Trump was overheard saying.READ MORE: Councillor apologises for trying to bill ratepayers for strip club beer It wasn&#x27;t clear exactly what had happened to Waddle, the second turkey set for reprieve.\"Waddle, by the way, is missing in action, but that&#x27;s OK. We&#x27;ll pretend Waddle is here,\" Trump said.The president also used the occasion to rail against his political rivals. Trump claimed that Biden had used an autopen for last year&#x27;s turkey pardon, which he claimed therefore made them \"totally invalid.\"He went on to joke that \"Peach\" and \"Blossom,\" the turkeys pardoned by Biden, were on their way to be processed, but that he was officially pardoning them along with this year&#x27;s birds.Illinois Governer JB Pritzker, who has pushed back on Trump&#x27;s threats to send the National Guard into Chicago, also came in for a serve.\"Governor Pritzker, if you&#x27;re listening, let&#x27;s get your act together,\" Trump said, while calling the governor a \"big fat slob.\"\"I refuse to talk about the fact that he&#x27;s a fat slob. I don&#x27;t mention it,\" Trump went on, before adding that he would like to lose a few pounds, too.Reported with Associated Press.
