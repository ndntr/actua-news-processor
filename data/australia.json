          "content": "Angus Taylor has resigned from the Coalition frontbench, setting up a contest to replace Sussan Ley as the Liberal Party leader. Taylor met with Ley last night and released a resignation letter saying the party was weaker than it had ever been and needed a change in leadership.\"I&#x27;ve tendered my resignation as a member of the shadow cabinet,\" Taylor told reporters at Parliament House.READ MORE: More than a million Aussies in line for major superannuation boost\"I&#x27;ve sought to be a constructive member of the leadership team, supported Sussan Ley&#x27;s leadership in a difficult time when we needed a rebuild of the party.\"But we can&#x27;t mince words. The Liberal Party is at the worst position it has been since 1944, when the party was formed. That is a confronting reality and we cannot ignore it.\"I don&#x27;t believe Sussan Ley is in a position to be able to lead the party, as it needs to be led from here.\"Taking a small number of questions, he refused to go into details about timing for a party room vote to spill the leadership and elect a new leader.Asked what he would do differently from Ley, Taylor said his focus would be on \"restoring our standard of living and protecting our way of life\".\"That&#x27;s what Australians want to see. You&#x27;ll hear you&#x27;ll hear more from me and others, I&#x27;m sure, in the coming days,\" he said.READ MORE: One Nation&#x27;s popularity is surging. But what does Pauline Hanson&#x27;s party actually stand for?Taylor said the tendering of his resignation had been delayed because it was important not to interrupt Israeli President Isaac Herzog&#x27;s visit to Parliament House. Ley is yet to comment.This morning Liberal frontbencher Claire Chandler resigned from Ley&#x27;s shadow ministry. Other Liberal frontbenchers are expected to follow.However, other key Liberals have told 9News Taylor&#x27;s numbers for victory are not assured.Ley, who met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog inside Parliament House yesterday, is the first woman to lead the Liberal Party after edging out Taylor in a party room ballot in May.Moderate Liberal MP Tim Wilson declined to give his outright backing when asked if he would continue to support Ley in a leadership vote.\"Well, as I&#x27;ve said, if you want loyalty, you have to show loyalty, and I believe in loyalty very much as a foundation for trust,\" he told ABC&#x27;s 7.30.\"And off the back of that, I will then be going on, of course, as processes go on, to make sure that I&#x27;m making the decision in the best interests of the Liberal Party.\"But I&#x27;ve said that, you know, I support the leader.\"He did not rule out backing Taylor in a leadership contest.Nine national affairs editor Andrew Probyn said many Liberals were angry that Ley hadn&#x27;t had a fair crack at the leadership while others were prepared to back Taylor but suspected he didn&#x27;t have what it took to take on Labor.\"What was striking about Angus Taylor tonight was that he didn&#x27;t announce any new policy direction at this stage, the main policy is simply that he wants to be leader now,\" Probyn said tonight.\"That may change tomorrow. Perhaps he&#x27;ll give his colleagues a better pitch, but for liberals voting in a leadership ballot, the biggest question is whether they stick with Sussan Ley.\"I&#x27;m told that the numbers remain tight, neither side entirely confident, but even Lee&#x27;s supporters want this damaging squabble sorted out one way or the other.\"Labor MPs were already laying into Taylor during question time today.\"Just when we thought that they couldn&#x27;t go any lower on economic credibility, the member for Hume says, &#x27;Hold my chardonnay&#x27;,\" Treasurer Jim Chalmers said.\"He is a living, breathing reminder that the Liberal Party has become the party of higher income taxes, higher deficits and higher debt. He goes months without asking questions in this place. \"Those opposite should ask themselves if they really want him to do to their party this term what he did to their economic credibility last term.\"A leadership spill has been looming after a tumultuous period for the Liberals.The Coalition split last month when three Nationals senators voted against the government&#x27;s hate groups bill and were sacked from the frontbench.Although the parties have since come back together, there have been growing concerns that One Nation has overtaken the Liberals in opinion polls and Ley&#x27;s personal preferred prime minister polls have tanked.The latest Newspoll released on Monday saw the Coalition&#x27;s primary vote slide to 18 per cent, now behind Labor at 33 per cent and One Nation on 27 per cent. The Liberal primary vote is just 15 per cent.Taylor, who had been the shadow defence spokesperson and formerly shadow treasurer, has emerged as the frontrunner to replace Ley in the event of a spill after fellow conservative Andrew Hastie withdrew from contention late last month.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
