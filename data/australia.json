READ MORE: Dezi Freeman&#x27;s brother reveals theory on accused cop killerSA Police Assistant Commissioner Ian Parrott said the search for Gus would be scaled back from today and the investigation would be managed by the Missing Persons Investigation Section.\"We are confident that we have done all we can to locate Gus within the search area,\" Parrott said.\"Despite our very best efforts to find Gus we have determined that the search will be scaled back from this afternoon.\"Parrott said no evidence had been recovered in the search for Gus.\"At this point, no trace of Gus has been located,\" he said.\"No tangible pieces of evidence, such as footprints, a hat or clothing, have been located to identify any direction of travel to assist searchers.\"READ MORE: Sydney dad accused of &#x27;indiscriminately&#x27; firing at passersby charged SA Police Deputy Commissioner Linda Williams confirmed a footprint discovered yesterday has been found to be unrelated to the missing four-year-old.9News understand a footprint found 500m from the homestead by searchers last week, however, has not been ruled out of the investigation. A \"significant\" aerial search using special drones with infrared technology was used on Friday and Saturday.It is the same technology police used in the search for the remains of Julian Story in Port Lincoln. \"It&#x27;s quite complex technology, so the results will take some time to work through, but police will investigate any findings through further searches,\" police said today.Police said officers may return to the property once the results of the drone mission are finalised. Over the past 48 hours, the search for Gus shifted to a recovery mission.Police spoke to the family last week to prepare them for the grim likelihood Gus has not survived. READ MORE: Half of Aussies think it&#x27;s OK to commit this &#x27;risky&#x27; WFH breach\"On Tuesday night senior police spoke to Gus&#x27; family and prepared them for the fact that Gus may not have survived due to the passage of time, his age and the nature of the terrain he is missing in,\" Parrott added.\"This assessment was based on medical evidence from a doctor who is recognised by the Australian rescue authorities as an expert opinion on time frame for survival.\"While those involved in the search have been hoping for a miracle, over the past 48 hours the search has shifted to a recovery operation.\"Police continue to investigate Gus&#x27; disappearance and are working to rule out every option. A public appeal remains in place for anyone with information. \"If anything is any information comes that directs us to conduct further searches in specific areas, we will be doing that in the coming weeks,\" Williams said.\"As we&#x27;ve stated, we will never give up hope of finding Gus.\"There are further lines of inquiry being undertaken and the family have continued to cooperate fully with police and have consented to every request that we have made of them thus far.\"An average of 30 SES volunteers have taken part in the search for Gus each day.The Australian Defence Force (ADF) also provided 50 personel for two days to assist police.Before it was scaled back, the search for Gus spanned seven days and an area of almost 500 square kilometres, involving aircraft and teams on the ground.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

The report, which is across his area of expertise, contained made-up references that were attributed to his colleagues.\"I was in no doubt, when I read the names of the works, that they were fake because I work in the area and I know my colleagues&#x27; work,\" he said.\"Once I discovered one, I just discovered more and more. \"One of the incorrectly referenced works was titled \"The Rule of Law and Administrative Justice in the Australian Social Security System\". The original work is called \"The Rule of Law and the Australian Constitution\".Rudge said the mistakes contained \"all the hallmarks\" of AI.\" I cannot understand how a human could create titles of works that don&#x27;t exist, that don&#x27;t appear on Google.

An updated report was reuploaded to the website on Friday, noting a \"small number of corrections to references and footnotes\" that it said \"in no way impact or affect the substantive content, findings and recommendations in the report\".
