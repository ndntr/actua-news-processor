Cooke said last year&#x27;s brief mortgage stress relief may have been \"wiped away\" following today&#x27;s rate hike. Treasurer Jim Chalmers acknowledged the decision is \"difficult news\" for millions of Australians with a mortgage.\"We understand the pressure that this puts on Australian families and businesses,\" Chalmers said.\"While today&#x27;s decision was widely expected, obviously that doesn&#x27;t make it any easier.\"READ MORE: Australia rolls out world-first vaccine trial for children with aggressive brain tumoursNot everyone with a mortgage will be worse off, though. Not all borrowers decreased their repayments when rates fell last year.According to Canstar, about 80 per cent of NAB variable rate customers and the \"vast majority\" of CBA&#x27;s didn&#x27;t reduce their repayments, giving them some welcome wiggle room now.If you are on a fixed rate, your repayments will stay the same until the fixed term ends.There&#x27;s a silver lining: the rate hike means those with a savings account or term deposit will enjoy a greater return on their money.When rates are higher, savings products will generally pay more interest.When the cash rate is lowered, interest returns will generally fall.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

Protests have been planned against the visit.The commissioner said that the Palestinian Action Group&#x27;s proposed route planned for next Monday would not have been authorised under the previous declaration .\"I know that there is significant animosity about President Herzog&#x27;s visit.\"Both on social media and in recent public assemblies, there has been significant animosity.\"To not do anything about that and to potentially put community safety at risk would be intolerable for me as the Commissioner.\"READ MORE: Sarah Ferguson sent email to Jeffrey Epstein calling him a &#x27;legend&#x27; and sparking rumours the financier fathered a child\"I can say that over the period of the visit, we&#x27;ll have over 3,000 police shifts operating to ensure [community] safety,\" Lanyon said.Today&#x27;s extension of the Public Assembly Restriction Declaration (PARD) is an extension of the declaration made on January 20.During this time, Form 1 applications for the authorisation of public assemblies will not be granted in certain locations.Individuals who attend in public assemblies at the specific locations during this time will not have the protection of the Summary Offences Act, with respect to obstructing traffic and pedestrians.Police will also have authority to require removal, for identification purposes, of any face coverings worn by people suspected of committing offences.The extension will remain in place for the next 14 days, unless changed or revoked.
