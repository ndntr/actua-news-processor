I don&#x27;t have money to dispense. I hold the national character.\"The governor-general&#x27;s role is to show up, is to come and offer comfort, but also to call on all Australians.READ MORE: CCTV captures dad and son alleged shooters heading for Bondi \"We have a job to do, and that is to make sure that we pull out of this dark period, the shade, and into light.\"\"This is so un-Australian, and we all condemn this in the harshest words, and we need strict laws around this,\" Amar Singh from Turbans for Australia said.\"All these perpetrators should be punished to the max because this is not on.\"This senseless terrorism has no place in Australia. We must do more to protect communities like our wonderful Jewish friends.\"Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull attended the vigil earlier today, laying flowers at the scene of the \"surreal\" attack.\"It&#x27;s hard to believe. It really is surreal to imagine that this could happen in Bondi. This is part of our lives. It&#x27;s part of our community,\" he said.&#x27;ABSOLUTE MASSACRE&#x27;: Bloodied witness describes chaos \"It&#x27;s very diverse, very multicultural.\"I spent my whole life in and out of Bondi. So it&#x27;s just I&#x27;m still struggling to believe this happened, but it did.\"So what we have to do is respond with love and with strength, with solidarity. We have to put our arms around the Jewish community.\"We have to show them that we love them, that we&#x27;ll support them, and we&#x27;ll stand by them. No matter what happens, and you know this, this is literally the worst that you could imagine.\"A sea of abandoned personal belongings from those who ran for their life has also lined the iconic beach.The collection of items left behind, include children&#x27;s toys, towels and deck chairs, as people fled for safety after two gunmen opened fire at Bondi Beach during the Hanukkah by the Sea celebration.\"I was in the water, and then suddenly I just see people jumping, so then I had to get out, and then I had to leave all my stuff,\" a young witness told 9News.\"Then I had to quickly run.\"\"We always send our children to have fun, and it was a holy day, it was Hannukah yesterday, it&#x27;s just devastating,\" another witness told 9News.\"We couldn&#x27;t sleep the whole night, especially when you send your most precious, your children.\"\"It&#x27;s just awful.\"\"It&#x27;s just traumatising, I see families broken,\" another young witness told 9News.READ MORE: What we know about the Bondi Beach shootingBondi lifeguards have collected many of the possessions and are waiting for their owners to retrieve them.If you have been impacted by the terror attack in Bondi there is support available.
