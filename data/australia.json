He was taken to Surry Hills Police Station, where he was charged with multiple offences, including nine counts of using a carriage service to transmit child abuse material and two counts of using a carriage service to access child abuse material.The 62-year-old is now also facing two counts of distributing bestiality material, distributing animal crush material, possession of prohibited drugs and participating in a criminal group contributing to criminal activity. He was denied bail and will appear in court today.The man is believed to be the last offender from NSW identified with links to the international paedophile network.However, investigators have identified an additional 145 offenders internationally, with referrals now being made to other law enforcement agencies within Australia, the US, Canada, Mexico, Europe, New Zealand, South America, and South East Asia.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
