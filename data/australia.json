          "content": "Hurricane Melissa has strengthened into a Category 5 storm as it draws closer to Jamaica, where forecasters say it will unleash catastrophic flooding, landslides and widespread damage. It is expected to be the strongest hurricane to hit the island since record-keeping began in 1851.Melissa, blamed for six deaths in the northern Caribbean as it headed toward the island, was on track to make landfall on Tuesday in Jamaica before coming ashore in Cuba later in the day and then heading toward the Bahamas. It was not expected to affect the US.READ MORE: &#x27;Just horrific&#x27;: Staggering scale of state&#x27;s wild weather realisedHanna Mcleod, a 23-year-old hotel receptionist in the Jamaican capital of Kingston, said she boarded up the windows at her home, where her husband and brother are staying. She stocked up on canned corned beef and mackerel and left candles and flashlights throughout the house.\"I just told them to keep the door closed,\" she said.\"I am definitely worried. This is actually the first time I&#x27;ll be experiencing this type of hurricane.\"Category 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, with sustained winds exceeding 250km/h. Melissa would be the strongest hurricane in recorded history to directly hit the small Caribbean nation, said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.A storm surge of up to four metres) was expected along the coast in Kingston, which Porter said is home to critical infrastructure such as Jamaica&#x27;s main international airport and power plants.READ MORE: Dad refused bail after boy dies in police station foyer \"This can become a true humanitarian crisis very quickly, and there is likely going to be the need for a lot of international support,\" Porter said in a phone interview.On Monday morning (early Tuesday AEDT), Melissa was centred about 230 kilometres south-west of Kingston and about 530 kilometres south-west of Guantánamo, Cuba, the US National Hurricane Centre in Miami said.The hurricane had maximum sustained winds of 266km/h and was moving west at 5km/h, the centre said.Some areas in eastern Jamaica could see up to 101 centimetres of rain while western Haiti could get 40 centimetres, according to the hurricane centre.

The fisherman said he had already secured his vessel and planned to ride out the storm with his friend.Several towns along Jamaica&#x27;s southern coast already reported power outages as winds intensified throughout the night.\"I don&#x27;t think the storm will damage my house. My only concern is flooding, because we live near the sea,\" said Hyacinth White, 49, who said she had no plans to evacuate to a shelter before the call was disconnected.A record storm for JamaicaThe slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing. Two people died in Jamaica over the weekend as they cut trees ahead of the storm, according to the country&#x27;s emergency management office.\"I want to urge Jamaicans to take this seriously,\" said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica&#x27;s Disaster Risk Management Council. \"Do not gamble with Melissa. It&#x27;s not a safe bet.\"In eastern Cuba, a hurricane warning was in effect for Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantánamo and Holguin provinces, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Las Tunas. Up to 51 centimetres of rain were forecast for parts of Cuba, along with a significant storm surge along the coast.A tropical storm warning was in effect for Haiti.Evan Thompson, principal director at Jamaica&#x27;s meteorological service, warned that clean-up and damage assessment would be severely delayed because of anticipated landslides, flooding and blocked roads.A storm of Category four or higher has not made landfall in Jamaica in recent history, Thompson said. Hurricane Gilbert was a Category three storm when it hit the island in 1988. Hurricanes Ivan and Beryl were both Category 4, but they did not make landfall.The life-threatening storm surge was expected along Jamaica&#x27;s southern coast, near and to the east of where Melissa is likely to make landfall, the US centre said.\"Don&#x27;t make foolish decisions,\" warned Daryl Vaz, Jamaica&#x27;s transport minister. \"We are in a very, very serious time over the next few days.\"A hit on Hispaniola The storm already has dropped heavy rain on the Dominican Republic, where schools and government offices were ordered to remain closed on Monday in four of nine provinces still under red alert.Melissa damaged more than 750 homes across the country and displaced more than 3760 people. Floodwaters also have cut access to at least 48 communities, officials said.In neighbouring Haiti, the storm destroyed crops in three regions, including 15 hectares of maize at a time when at least 5.7 million people, more than half of the country&#x27;s population, are experiencing crisis levels of hunger.\"Flooding is obstructing access to farmland and markets, jeopardising harvests and the winter agricultural season,\" the UN&#x27;s Food and Agriculture Organisation said.Melissa was expected to keep dumping heavy rain over parts of Haiti as it moves north-east in the coming days.A hurricane watch was in effect for the southeastern and central Bahamas and for the Turks and Caicos Islands.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Jean-Michel Trogneux is the name of Brigitte&#x27;s brother.The two-day trial in Paris starting on Monday comes after the Macrons filed a defamation suit in July in a Delaware court as their lawyer said they&#x27;ll be seeking \"substantial\" damages from US conservative influencer Candace Owens if she persists with claims that Brigitte is a man.Owens is a right-leaning political commentator whose YouTube channel has about 4.5 million subscribers.
