          "content": "Many thousands have swarmed Flinders Street in Melbourne in a mass protest against Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who made appearances across the city today as he concluded his Australian visit.Flinders Street was blocked to trams and traffic as demonstrators marched down Swanston Street to parliament, accusing Herzog of being a war criminal. Victoria Police said about 10,000 people had gathered outside Flinders Street Station whilst organisers put the number at 30,000.\"We are here today because our government has invited someone who is on trial for incitement of genocide against a population of 2 million besieged Palestinians in Gaza,\" organiser Noura Mansour said.READ MORE: Special Envoy appointed to pursue investigations into Laos methanol poisoning deaths\"We reject this visit, we reject genocide and we reject the very values that this unwelcomed guest represent.\"Police said there were no significant public order issues and special powers granted for the day&#x27;s events had not been used.A 39-year-old Coburg North man was interviewed during the afternoon rally and released pending summons for assault police.\"The police officer was not physically injured during the incident,\" police said.Herzog was on his way back to Jerusalem tonight following four days of engagements with dignitaries, Bondi terror attack survivors and members of the Jewish community.The president touched down in Melbourne under heavy police guard for the last day of his Australian tour.The president flew into Tullamarine on an RAAF jet this morning ahead of a number of official engagements.Escorted by a police convoy, Herzog arrived at Government House just before midday, where he met with Governor Margaret Gardner and Premier Jacinta Allan.Police quickly shut down a demonstration by a small group of protesters outside the grounds of Government House.This afternoon Herzog addressed a crowd of supporters in Southbank, directly referencing widespread protests that have shadowed his visit.Dozens of police barricaded City Road in front of a large fence, close to a Zionist Federation of Australia-hosted event where the president spoke to community members.The final engagement in Herzog&#x27;s visit, the event was sold as \"an afternoon of reflection, unity and shared purpose\".Allan, Opposition Leader Jess Wilson and victims of the Bondi terror attack attended the event, alongside scores of Victorian Jews.A small group of pro-Palestine protesters demonstrated near the blockade, including several people dressed as police officers, demanding the arrest of Herzog.\"We have an international war criminal that is being currently protected by our local boys. It&#x27;s a problem,\" one protester said.The pro-Palestine group briefly interacted with a small number of counter-protesters waving Israeli flags, but the demonstration appeared largely peaceful.READ MORE: Liberal leadership spill confirmed ahead of partyroom meeting where Angus Taylor will challenge Sussan LeyInside the event, Herzog urged protesters outside to \"go protest in front of the Iranian embassy\", citing internal conflict that has seen tens of thousands of Iran&#x27;s own citizens killed.\"To me it&#x27;s obscure and odd that we need to have so many incredible police officers protecting us for the inherent right for us to gather here as proud Jews... to host the president of the only Jewish state on earth, without any harassment,\" Herzog said.The Israeli dignitary offered a wider message of hope to the crowd, noting that he hoped his visit would \"console\" the community and \"salute the many heroes of Bondi\".\"The resolve and solidarity of this community are key to the future that we all share in Melbourne and in Jerusalem,\" he said. \"We came to remind you that you are not alone here in the diaspora, and we leave understanding more than ever before that we have each other.\"Premier condemns anti-Herzog graffiti The words \"Death To Herzog + Israel + Oz\" were scrawled across the University of Melbourne&#x27;s Parkville Campus in black spray paint alongside an inverted triangle - a symbol commonly used by pro-Palestine protesters and Hamas militia.READ MORE: Actor James Van Der Beek dies aged 48\"It&#x27;s absolutely contemptible because we all want peace to come and causing hurt and grief and violence like we&#x27;ve seen in Sydney, that does not bring peace,\" Allan said of the graffiti.Victoria Police were out in force across the course of the day, with specialist forces brought in to help maintain safety and avoid a repeat of violent scenes in Sydney on Monday.Yesterday, the Supreme Court granted police special powers to search individuals and vehicles in the vicinity of the president and his convoy.\"Victoria Police has been granted those powers that afford us, in specified areas, to seek the identities of individuals passing through that location, to search individuals, to search vehicles, and to cordon off a particular area,\" Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Regional Operations Bob Hill said yesterday.\"It&#x27;s specific to areas he will visit and it will not directly relate to or impact upon the lawful protest activity that may occur here in Melbourne tomorrow evening.\" READ MORE: FBI searches highways in Nancy Guthrie search as man detained in case releasedNEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

          "content": "Angus Taylor has resigned from the Coalition frontbench, setting up a contest to replace Sussan Ley as the Liberal Party leader. Taylor met with Ley last night and released a resignation letter saying the party was weaker than it had ever been and needed a change in leadership.\"I&#x27;ve tendered my resignation as a member of the shadow cabinet,\" Taylor told reporters at Parliament House.READ MORE: More than a million Aussies in line for major superannuation boost\"I&#x27;ve sought to be a constructive member of the leadership team, supported Sussan Ley&#x27;s leadership in a difficult time when we needed a rebuild of the party.\"But we can&#x27;t mince words. The Liberal Party is at the worst position it has been since 1944, when the party was formed. That is a confronting reality and we cannot ignore it.\"I don&#x27;t believe Sussan Ley is in a position to be able to lead the party, as it needs to be led from here.\"Taking a small number of questions, he refused to go into details about timing for a party room vote to spill the leadership and elect a new leader.Asked what he would do differently from Ley, Taylor said his focus would be on \"restoring our standard of living and protecting our way of life\".\"That&#x27;s what Australians want to see. You&#x27;ll hear you&#x27;ll hear more from me and others, I&#x27;m sure, in the coming days,\" he said.READ MORE: One Nation&#x27;s popularity is surging. But what does Pauline Hanson&#x27;s party actually stand for?Taylor said the tendering of his resignation had been delayed because it was important not to interrupt Israeli President Isaac Herzog&#x27;s visit to Parliament House. Ley is yet to comment.This morning Liberal frontbencher Claire Chandler resigned from Ley&#x27;s shadow ministry. Other Liberal frontbenchers are expected to follow.However, other key Liberals have told 9News Taylor&#x27;s numbers for victory are not assured.Ley, who met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog inside Parliament House yesterday, is the first woman to lead the Liberal Party after edging out Taylor in a party room ballot in May.Moderate Liberal MP Tim Wilson declined to give his outright backing when asked if he would continue to support Ley in a leadership vote.\"Well, as I&#x27;ve said, if you want loyalty, you have to show loyalty, and I believe in loyalty very much as a foundation for trust,\" he told ABC&#x27;s 7.30.\"And off the back of that, I will then be going on, of course, as processes go on, to make sure that I&#x27;m making the decision in the best interests of the Liberal Party.\"But I&#x27;ve said that, you know, I support the leader.\"He did not rule out backing Taylor in a leadership contest.Nine national affairs editor Andrew Probyn said many Liberals were angry that Ley hadn&#x27;t had a fair crack at the leadership while others were prepared to back Taylor but suspected he didn&#x27;t have what it took to take on Labor.\"What was striking about Angus Taylor tonight was that he didn&#x27;t announce any new policy direction at this stage, the main policy is simply that he wants to be leader now,\" Probyn said tonight.\"That may change tomorrow. Perhaps he&#x27;ll give his colleagues a better pitch, but for liberals voting in a leadership ballot, the biggest question is whether they stick with Sussan Ley.\"I&#x27;m told that the numbers remain tight, neither side entirely confident, but even Lee&#x27;s supporters want this damaging squabble sorted out one way or the other.\"Labor MPs were already laying into Taylor during question time today.\"Just when we thought that they couldn&#x27;t go any lower on economic credibility, the member for Hume says, &#x27;Hold my chardonnay&#x27;,\" Treasurer Jim Chalmers said.\"He is a living, breathing reminder that the Liberal Party has become the party of higher income taxes, higher deficits and higher debt. He goes months without asking questions in this place. \"Those opposite should ask themselves if they really want him to do to their party this term what he did to their economic credibility last term.\"A leadership spill has been looming after a tumultuous period for the Liberals.The Coalition split last month when three Nationals senators voted against the government&#x27;s hate groups bill and were sacked from the frontbench.Although the parties have since come back together, there have been growing concerns that One Nation has overtaken the Liberals in opinion polls and Ley&#x27;s personal preferred prime minister polls have tanked.The latest Newspoll released on Monday saw the Coalition&#x27;s primary vote slide to 18 per cent, now behind Labor at 33 per cent and One Nation on 27 per cent. The Liberal primary vote is just 15 per cent.Taylor, who had been the shadow defence spokesperson and formerly shadow treasurer, has emerged as the frontrunner to replace Ley in the event of a spill after fellow conservative Andrew Hastie withdrew from contention late last month.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
