She adjourned the case to September 30, with Winmar&#x27;s bail extended to that date.Winmar, who was supported by Dann and his case management worker, ignored questions from reporters as he left court.The AFL legend became the first Aboriginal footballer to play 200 games in the league, finishing his career with 230 games at St Kilda and 21 for the Western Bulldogs.He fought back against a number of acts of racism throughout his career, including famously standing in front of a Collingwood crowd abusing him in 1993, lifting his jumper and proudly pointing at his skin.In March, he was asked to co-lead a landmark racism class action in the Supreme Court, brought by other retired Indigenous players including Phil Krakouer.Winmar previously avoided a jail sentence in 2019 for his drunken assault of a cab driver.READ MORE: GP charged with assaulting female patients DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
