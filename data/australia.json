          "standfirst": "At least 20 people, including five journalists, were killed in two Israeli missile strikes on the building.",
          "content": "Israel struck one of the main hospitals in the Gaza Strip and then hit the facility again as journalists and rescue workers rushed to the scene, killing at least 20 people and wounding scores more, local health workers said.It was among the deadliest of several Israeli strikes that have hit both hospitals and journalists over the course of the 22-month war sparked by Hamas&#x27; October 7, 2023, attack, and the assault came as Israel plans to widen its offensive to heavily populated areas.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s office said the strike on Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis was a \"tragic mishap\" and that the military was investigating.READ MORE: &#x27;Not deserving of the court&#x27;s mercy&#x27;: Life in jail awaitsThe first strike hit an upper floor housing operating rooms and doctors&#x27; residences, killing at least two people, according to Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the records department at the Gaza Health Ministry.The second strike hit an external stairwell as rescuers and journalists raced to the scene of the first, killing another 18. Around 80 people were wounded, including many in the hospital&#x27;s courtyard, al-Waheidi said.Among those killed was 33-year-old Mariam Dagga, a visual journalist who had worked for The Associated Press. Dagga regularly reported for multiple outlets from the hospital, including a recent story for the AP on doctors struggling to save children from starvation.The strike killed four other journalists who had worked for Al Jazeera, Reuters and Middle East Eye, a UK-based media outlet, most on a contractor or freelance basis.Reuters said it was showing live video from the hospital when the feed suddenly shut down. The journalist filming the live shot was killed in the first strike, Reuters said, citing hospital officials.Video shot from across the street by pan-Arab channel Al Ghad showed people climbing the external stairwell just after the first strike, past walls with chunks shorn off – followed by the boom of the second strike, a huge plume of smoke and a heap of wreckage.READ MORE: With seven words, PM opens door to major tax changeIsraeli media reported that Israeli troops fired two artillery shells at the hospital, targeting what they suspected was a Hamas surveillance camera on the roof.Brigadier General Effie Defrin, an Israeli military spokesman, said the army does not target civilians and had launched an internal investigation into the strikes. He accused Hamas of hiding among civilians but did not say whether Israel believed any militants were present during the strikes on the hospital.Netanyahu&#x27;s statement said: \"Israel deeply regrets the tragic mishap that occurred today at the Nasser Hospital in Gaza. Israel values the work of journalists, medical staff, and all civilians.\"The UN secretary-general, along with Britain, France and others, condemned the attack. When asked about the strike, US President Donald Trump initially said he was not aware of it before offering: \"I&#x27;m not happy about it. I don&#x27;t want to see it.\"Trump later said he thought there might be a \"conclusive ending\" in Gaza in the coming weeks, without elaborating. It was not clear if he was referring to Israel&#x27;s coming offensive or to long-running ceasefire talks.Israel has attacked hospitals multiple times throughout the war, asserting that Hamas embeds itself in and around the facilities, though Israeli officials rarely provide evidence. Hamas security personnel have been seen inside such facilities during the war, and parts of those sites have been off limits to the public.The hospitals that remain open have been overwhelmed by the dead, wounded and now by increasing numbers of malnourished as parts of Gaza are experiencing famine.A British doctor working on the floor that was hit said the second strike came before people could start evacuating from the first.\"Just absolute scenes of chaos, disbelief and fear,\" the doctor said. They described people leaving trails of blood as they entered the ward. The hospital was already overwhelmed, with patients with IV drips lying on the floor in the corridors in stifling heat.The doctor spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations from their organisation to avoid reprisals from Israeli authorities.\"It leaves me in another state of shock that hospitals can be a target,\" the doctor said.Nasser Hospital has withstood raids and bombardment during the war, with officials repeatedly noting critical shortages of supplies and staff.A June strike on the hospital killed three people, according to the Health Ministry. The military said at the time that it targeted a Hamas command and control center. A March strike on its surgical unit days after Israel ended a ceasefire killed a Hamas official and a 16-year-old boy.Al-Awda Hospital said Israeli gunfire killed six aid-seekers trying to reach a distribution point in central Gaza and wounded another 15.The shootings were the latest in the Netzarim Corridor, a military zone where UN convoys have been overrun by looters and desperate crowds, and where people have been shot and killed while heading to sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an Israeli-backed American contractor.The GHF denied that any shootings had occurred near its site. The Israeli military said it was not aware of any casualties from Israeli fire in that area.Al-Awda said two Israeli strikes in central Gaza killed six Palestinians, including a child. Shifa Hospital in Gaza City said three Palestinians, including a child, were killed in a strike there.The war in Gaza has been one of the bloodiest for media workers, with 189 Palestinian journalists killed by Israeli fire, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. More than 1500 health workers have been killed, according to the UN.Israel&#x27;s \"killing of journalists in Gaza continues while the world watches and fails to act firmly on the most horrific attacks the press has ever faced in recent history,\" said Sara Qudah, regional director of the Committee to Protect Journalists.The Foreign Press Association, which represents international media in Israel and the Palestinian territories, called on Israel \"to halt its abhorrent practice of targeting journalists.\"\"This has gone on far too long,\" it said. \"Too many journalists in Gaza have been killed by Israel without justification.\" The group also noted that Israel has barred international journalists from entering Gaza since the start of the war apart from visits organised by the military.The health ministry said Sunday that at least 62,686 Palestinians have been killed in the war. It does not distinguish between fighters and civilians but says around half have been women and children. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The UN and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.The war began when Hamas-led militants abducted 251 people and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the 2023 attack. Most of the hostages have been released in ceasefires or other deals, but 50 remain in Gaza, with around 20 believed to be alive.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
