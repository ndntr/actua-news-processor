It&#x27;s made $20 millionHow was Tyler Robinson caught?Robinson was first identified as a suspect by his own father, who recognised his son from photos and videos released by law enforcement.Robinson&#x27;s father reportedly confronted the 22-year-old and urged him to turn himself in, but Robinson refused.Despite this, Robinson reportedly confided in a youth pastor who was connected to law enforcement, and there were several clues connecting Robinson to the shooting.He was seen wearing a distinct outfit before and after the shooting, which was the same clothing he was later arrested in.Robinson also left messages on Discord, a social media service, saying he had to \"pick up a rifle\" and leave it in a bush.READ MORE: Teacher who beat cancer killed in tragic jet ski accidentWhat were Tyler Robinson&#x27;s motives for allegedly shooting Charlie Kirk?Reports indicate Robinson had become more politically active in the lead-up to the shooting.He was deeply critical of Kirk and his views, with bullet casings of a rifle found by police allegedly inscribed with messages including \"Hey fascist! Catch!\" and other messages related to online game culture.Robinson had also made comments critical of Kirk at a recent family dinner, investigators were told.It is also believed Robinson may have been in a romantic relationship with his roommate, who is transitioning from male to female.Kirk was public in his views on transgender people, praising Trump for revoking an order allowing transgender people to openly serve in the military.Cox said the roommate had \"no idea\" about the shooting before it occurred. What are Tyler Robinson&#x27;s beliefs?Tyler Robinson is a registered voter but isn&#x27;t affiliated to any political party, and there is no evidence to suggest he had voted in his local county.According to reports, the rest of the Robinson family were Republican voters and his mother had expressed support for Trump.His family are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which is popular in Utah.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
