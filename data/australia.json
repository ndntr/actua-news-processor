[and] public interest harm\".\"We centre survivors, whistleblowers, and community voices — especially where institutions have failed to act,\" the website reads.Germanotta-Mills was taken to Mascot Police Station, where he was charged with multiple offences, including seven counts of using a carriage service to access child abuse material.READ MORE: Hit with an unusual spring flu?

Speaking to media, Detective Superintendent Jayne Doherty said the material was \"abhorrent\" and outlined some of the alleged activities of the group.\"[They engaged] in conversations and the sharing of material which depicted child abuse and the torture of children,\" she said.\" Police will allege in court that the initial examination of these devices has discovered thousands of videos depicting the abuse of live children between the ages of babies and 12 years of age.\"Amongst these deplorable images were also a number of videos depicting the sexual abuse of animals.\"Police are not alleging the men created the material.
