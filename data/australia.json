Russia is a real bear.\"Wary Ukrainians hope for solid US supportSome Ukrainians expressed hope that Trump&#x27;s words would be backed up by concrete support for Ukraine in Washington, while others were wary about the American president&#x27;s unpredictability.\"We need such support from America, from Donald Trump, and we hope that this will continue in the future — the same rhetoric, the same attitude toward us, toward Ukraine, and toward the war in Ukraine,\" Olha Voronina, a 66-year-old Kyiv resident, said.Volodymyr Cheslavskyi, a 48-year-old soldier recovering from a war wound, said he considered Trump to be more interested in making money than helping Ukraine, and kept people guessing about his true intentions with contradictory statements.\"He can say different things each time — he supports Ukraine, or he does not support Ukraine,\" Cheslavskyi told The Associated Press in St Michael&#x27;s Square in the Ukrainian capital.Anna Khudimova, 43, said she believed her country&#x27;s armed forces could prevail on the battlefield against Russia&#x27;s bigger army.\"But we cannot do it without the help of NATO, without the support of Europe,\" she said. \"If Trump influences the situation, then perhaps this can be realistic.\"Russia has occupied around 20 per cent of Ukraine since it annexed Crimea in 2014. The all-out invasion began in February 2022.US and Ukraine eye joint weapons productionIn comments on Tuesday at the United Nations and on social media, Trump took a swipe at Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s leadership, made cutting remarks about Russia&#x27;s military prowess and derided the Russian economy&#x27;s performance. He also said NATO countries should shoot down Russian warplanes entering their airspace, as happened recently in Estonia.Trump&#x27;s comments were an unanticipated departure from his previous positions on the war, when he was publicly cool, even at times hostile, toward Ukraine and apparently more amenable to Putin.After taking office in January, Trump reversed the three-year US policy of isolating Russia when he called Putin. He has also ruled out the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO, has said Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would need to negotiate swapping land in return for a peace deal with Moscow, and on social media called Zelenskyy \"a dictator without elections\".A senior Ukrainian lawmaker said Trump&#x27;s latest remarks were unexpected but important.\"What remains important to us is not only Trump&#x27;s words, but also whether he fulfils the earlier promises regarding decisive sanctions\" on Russia, Oleksandr Merezhko, chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament&#x27;s Committee on Foreign Policy and Interparliamentary Cooperation, told the AP.Kremlin says it is protecting Russia&#x27;s securityZelenskyy and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov addressed the UN General Assembly later Wednesday.Trump said on social media Tuesday: \"With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option\".Max Bergmann, the Director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said that when he read Trump&#x27;s post, his reaction was, \"the US is out\" and handing off to Europe.\"I feel that it&#x27;s the president sort of signing off, like: &#x27;We&#x27;ll keep sort of doing some stuff, but this is basically your problem,&#x27;\" Bergmann said on the sidelines of a defence conference in Tallinn, Estonia.Russia&#x27;s state television channels cast Trump&#x27;s comments as part of his efforts to shift the burden of dealing with the conflict to Europe and encourage it to buy more American weapons.Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, challenged Trump&#x27;s comment that \"Russia has been fighting aimlessly\".DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Typhoon Ragasa, one of the strongest storms to hit Asia in years, whipped waves taller than lampposts onto Hong Kong promenades and turned seas rough on the southern Chinese coast overnight after leaving deadly destruction in Taiwan and the Philippines.In Taiwan, 17 people died after floods submerged roads and carried away vehicles in one county, and 10 deaths were reported in the northern Philippines.Nearly 1.9 million people were relocated across Guangdong province, the southern Chinese economic powerhouse.READ MORE: Mum&#x27;s anger over breastfeeding ban during CPR course A weather station in Chuandao town recorded maximum gusts of 241km/hr at noon, a high in Jiangmen city since record-keeping began. State broadcaster CCTV said the typhoon made landfall along the coast of Hailing Island in Yangjiang city at about 5 pm (7 pm Wednesday AEST), packing maximum winds near the centre of 144km/hr. Violent winds battered trees and buildings, with torrential rain lowering visibility, video from China&#x27;s state-run Xinhua news agency showed.The typhoon is forecast to keep moving west, prompting the suspension of some train services in the Gunagxi region on Thursday. Chinese officials allocated tens of millions of dollars for relief efforts.Schools, factories and transportation services were initially suspended in about a dozen cities, but a few of them distant from the landfall location were preparing to resume work as winds weakened.READ MORE: Two detainees killed and another critically injured at ICE facility in TexasWinds and waves lash Hong KongThe fierce winds, brought by Ragasa, once a super typhoon, woke Hong Kong residents in the early hours, and many went online to describe scenes like a kitchen ventilation fan being blown down and a crane swaying.Strong winds blew away parts of a pedestrian bridge&#x27;s roof and knocked down hundreds of trees across the city. A vessel crashed into the shore, shattering a row of glass railings along the waterfront. Areas around some rivers and promenades were flooded, including cycling lanes and playgrounds. At several promenade restaurants, furniture was scattered chaotically by the winds. Ninety injured people were treated at hospitals.A video that showed waves of water crashing through the doors of a hotel and flooding its interiors went viral in the financial hub. The hotel has not immediately commented on the incident.READ MORE: Ukraine&#x27;s president says world in &#x27;most destructive arms race in history&#x27; Hong Kong and Macao, a nearby casino hub, cancelled schools and flights, with many shops closed. Hundreds of people sought refuge in temporary centres in each city. Streets in Macao turned into streams with debris floating on the water.Rescue crews deployed inflatable boats to save those who were trapped. The gambling city&#x27;s local electricity supplier suspended its power supply in some flooded, low-lying areas for safety. As the winds eased, some waded into flooded streets to catch fish.Hong Kong&#x27;s observatory said Ragasa had maximum sustained winds near the centre of about 195km/hr and skirted around 100km to the south of the city. Hong Kong categorises cyclones with sustained winds 185km/hr or stronger as super typhoons to make residents extra vigilant about intense storms.The observatory said Ragasa is the strongest tropical cyclone in the northwestern Pacific and South China Sea region so far this year. Preliminary analysis showed it also ranks as the second-strongest one in the South China Sea region since the observatory&#x27;s record-keeping began in 1950, tying with typhoons Saola in 2023 and Yagi in 2024, it said.Dozens dead in floods and at sea in Philippines and TaiwanRagasa earlier caused deaths and damage in Taiwan and the Philippines after the typhoon took a path between them.In Taiwan, 17 people died after heavy rain caused a barrier lake in Hualien County to overflow Tuesday and torrents of muddy water destroyed a bridge, turning roads in Guangfu township into churning rivers that carried vehicles and furniture away.Guangfu has about 8450 people, more than half of whom sought safety on higher floors of their homes or on higher ground on Wednesday morning.Rescuers managed to establish contact with more than 100 others who were previously unreachable in Hualien, and were going door-to-door to check on the remaining 17 residents. A total of 32 people were injured across the self-ruled island.At least 10 deaths were reported in the northern Philippines, including seven fishermen who drowned after their boat was battered by huge waves and fierce wind and flipped over on Monday off Santa Ana town in northern Cagayan province. Five other fishermen remained missing, provincial officials said.Nearly 700,000 people were affected by the onslaught, of whom 25,000 fled to government emergency shelters.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
