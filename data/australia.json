Later, Trump warmly endorsed AUKUS when he hosted Albanese at the White House, saying it was \"full steam ahead\".NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

Though Obama didn&#x27;t directly address Trump&#x27;s post, he said, \"There&#x27;s this sort of clown show that&#x27;s happening in social media and on television,\" adding that people \"who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect\" appear to not be showing \"any shame about this\".Trump has refused to apologise for the video, blaming a staffer for the mistake and insisting he hadn&#x27;t seen the final frames of the video which contained the offensive content.\"I think it&#x27;s important to recognise that the majority of the American people find this behaviour deeply troubling,\" Obama said.\"It is true that it gets attention.
