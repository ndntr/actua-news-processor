The pair were found critically injured on the street about 200 metres apart in what police have described as having \"the hallmarks of a youth gang crime\". Neighbours reported hearing their screams and rushed outside to help but it was too late.\" It&#x27;s absolutely shocking that not one, but two could happen so close to home, at 8 o&#x27;clock at night,\" one neighbour told 9News.Police said the victims weren&#x27;t gang members and were investigating if their deaths were a horrific case of mistaken identity.The boy&#x27;s grieving family and friends are pleading for justice.Dau&#x27;s father said he needed answers for his son.\"This is a basketball player, he&#x27;s not a criminal,\" Elbino Akueng said.\"I&#x27;m talking on behalf of my community, this is happening to us.READ MORE: Man dies after early morning shooting in Melbourne&#x27;s CBD\"In the last month, we have buried four kids, similar incidents keep happening, but there&#x27;s no answer from police.\" Emergency services first found Chol, who paramedics tried to resuscitate but couldn&#x27;t save.Chol&#x27;s father, Cauti Nuong, described him as a \"good boy\" who was very clever.\"Very intelligent, he&#x27;s always so active,\" he told 9News.

The trial would have seen three beaches across Waverley, Northern Beaches and Central Coast councils have nets removed.READ MORE: Putin says foreign troops deployed to Ukraine would be legitimate targetsREAD MORE: Wealthy US family &#x27;matriarch&#x27; convicted of ex-son-in-law&#x27;s murderNets were installed on Monday at 51 beaches between Newcastle and Wollongong.The NSW government annually installs mesh nets at beaches up and down the coast every summer, along with drumlines, drone surveillance and listening stations as part of a $21.5 million shark safety initiativeNorthern Beaches Police Area Commander John Duncan yesterday said the attack was a \"freak incident that happens very, very rarely\".There has not been a fatal shark attack on a netted NSW beach since 1951. The exact species of shark which attacked Psillakis remains unknown, however a great white was detected by drumlines prior to the incident.Beaches across Sydney&#x27;s northern region remained closed today as members of the Dee Why Surf Life Saving Club patrolled the water and monitored it via drones.President of the Surf Life Saving - Sydney Northern Beaches Rob McGibbon said Dee Why wold remain closed for up to 72 hours.The attack took place south of the lagoon at Long Reef, a section of the popular beach which is netted. Local surfer Angela Edwards, told The Sydney Morning Herald that she wanted to see more tag-and-release and drones to keep the beach safe.\"We have to co-exist, and we have the technology,\" she said.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
