What&#x27;s next is the search and rescue operation,\" he added.It was unclear how many people remained missing or trapped. Hong Kong leader John Lee said contact had been lost with 279 people early yesterday.Authorities did not provide updates on the missing people or how many were still inside the ravaged buildings yesterday during a press conference.Video showed rescuers searching in some apartments in the dark.Orange flames were still seen from inside several windows, though the whole complex was now largely a blackened ruin.READ MORE: Noah learnt about the social media ban on social media. Now, he&#x27;s fighting it in court Firefighters have been trying to control the flames since mid-afternoon on Wednesday, when the fire was believed to have started in bamboo scaffolding and construction netting and then spread across seven of the complex&#x27;s eight buildings.Chan said the blaze spread \"exceptionally fast\" across the towers, and emergency workers struggled to gain access inside.\"Debris and scaffolding were falling from upper floors,\" he told reporters.\"There are also other reasons like high temperature, darkness ... (and) emergency vehicle access was blocked by fallen scaffolding and debris, making our access to the building very difficult.\"More than 70 people were injured, including 11 firefighters, as well as the 94 killed, the Fire Services Department said.About 900 people were evacuated to temporary shelters overnight.READ MORE: $5 billion early Christmas gift could be on the cards for every AussiePope Leo XIV sent a telegram to Hong Kong&#x27;s bishop yesterday, saying he was saddened by the fire and offering prayers for the injured, their families and emergency workers.Resident Lawrence Lee was waiting for news about his wife, who he believed was still trapped in their apartment.\"When the fire started, I told her on the phone to escape. But once she left the flat, the corridor and stairs were all filled with smoke and it was all dark, so she had no choice but to go back to the flat,\" he said, as he waited in one of the shelters overnight.Winter and Sandy Chung, who lived in one of the towers, said they saw sparks fly around as they evacuated on Wednesday afternoon.Although they were safe, they were worried about their home. \"I couldn&#x27;t sleep the entire night,\" Winter Chung, 75, told The Associated Press yesterday.READ MORE: How did the Hong Kong high rise fire turn so deadly, so quickly? Three arrested on suspicion of manslaughterThree men, the directors and an engineering consultant of a construction company, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.Police have not directly named the company where they work.\"We have reason to believe that those in charge of the construction company were grossly negligent,\" said Eileen Chung, a senior superintendent of police.Police on Thursday also searched the office of Prestige Construction and Engineering Company, which the AP confirmed was in charge of renovations in the tower complex.Police seized boxes of documents as evidence, according to local media. Phones for Prestige rang unanswered.Authorities suspected some materials on the exterior walls of the high-rise buildings did not meet fire resistance standards, allowing the unusually fast spread of the fire.READ MORE: Woman dead, man in hospital after shark attack at NSW beachPolice also said they found plastic foam panels – which are highly flammable – attached to the windows on each floor near the elevator lobby of the one unaffected tower.It was believed to have been installed by the construction company. but the purpose was not clear.Secretary for Security Chris Tang said they would investigate the materials further.Buildings were covered in scaffoldingThe housing complex consisted of eight buildings with almost 2000 apartments for about 4800 residents, including many older people.It was built in the 1980s and had been undergoing a major renovation. Hong Kong&#x27;s anti-corruption agency said yesterday it was launching a probe into possible corruption relating to the renovation project.Officials said the fire started on the external scaffolding of a 32-story tower, then spread on the bamboo scaffolding and construction netting to the inside of the building and then to the other buildings, likely aided by windy conditions.Bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in Hong Kong at building construction and renovation projects, though Lee said officials will meet with industry representatives to discuss a switch to metal scaffolding amid safety concerns.\"While we know that bamboo scaffolding has a long history in Hong Kong, its flame retardancy is inferior to that of metal scaffolding,\" said Eric Chan, the Chief Secretary for Administration.\"For safety reasons, the government believes that a complete switch to metal scaffolding should be implemented in suitable working environments\"Authorities will also be carrying out immediate inspections of all housing estates that are undergoing major renovation work to ensure scaffolding and construction materials meet safety standards.The fire was the deadliest in Hong Kong in decades.In November 1996, 41 people died in a commercial building in Kowloon in a fire that lasted for around 20 hours.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
