          "content": "NSW Police expect to charge two men over the alleged kidnapping and murder of Chris Baghsarian, after remains found yesterday were positively identified as the Sydney grandfather.Baghsarian, 85, who disappeared from his North Ryde home shortly before 5am on Friday, February 13, was the victim of a mistaken-identity abduction, police say.Two men were taken into custody this morning and are still being processed, however police will allege in court that the men \"participated in a joint criminal enterprise with other persons\" that led to Baghsarian&#x27;s death.READ MORE: Queensland pub owner&#x27;s plea after being forced to raise menu priceshttps://omny.fm/shows/ben-fordham-full-show/exclusive-police-questioning-2-men-over-death-of-kidnapped-grandfather/embed?style=coverThe arrested men were previously known to police for \"insignificant matters\", Detective Acting Superintendent Andrew Marks said.Police believe more people may be involved in Baghsarian&#x27;s alleged abduction and murder.Marks said investigators suspect there were \"more than three\" offenders linked to the alleged crime.\"I want to comment on the hard work of the detectives, the analysts, the forensic police, and all those who worked on this case around the clock to get the results we got today,\" Marks said.\"I want to assure you that our work is not done and we will continue to identify those who are also involved in this horrible, horrible matter.\"We know that there&#x27;s others involved.\"Human remains were found in grassland near a golf course in the semi-rural Sydney suburb of Pitt Town yesterday morning.The remai ns were identified as Baghsarian following forensic testing.Police suspect Baghsarian died at an address in Dural, which was identified as the kidnappers&#x27; \"stronghold\".Marks said he was deceased at the time he was taken to the location in Pitt Town, about 9pm on February 14.His cause of death is yet to be formally established and an autopsy is under way. At about 6.30am today, police executed two search warrants in Kenthurst and Castle Hill.A 29-year-old man was arrested at the Kenthurst address, and a 24-year-old at the Castle Hill address.They remain in police custody, but no charges have been laid. Marks said both men were living at their parents&#x27; homes.Police also conducted a search at a third home in NSW&#x27;s Lake Macquarie and two electronic devices were seized for forensic testing. One of the arrested men travelled to this address following Baghsarian&#x27;s alleged kidnapping, Marks said.He confirmed police have spoken with a person who resides at the property but said they are not a suspect.\" I believe those two that were arrested today, they were probably waiting for us to come,\" Marks said, adding that the parents were \"shocked\" by the arrests.Marks said police believed the men were involved in a \"joint criminal enterprise\" but could not comment on whether overseas actors had organised the incident.He also confirmed the intended kidnapping target would have held for ransom for $50 million.\"They are organised criminals, they hide behind encrypted devices,\" Marks added.\"I have a number of names for them. but I probably coldn&#x27;t say it here today.\" Arrest vision shows police swooping on the home in Kenthurst, before using a battering ram to enter the property and arrest the older man.Officers then arrived at another home in Castle Hill, located around 10 kilometres from Kenthurst, and took a second man into custody.Footage also shows the two men being led into Riverstone Police Station. \"We welcome the news of the recent arrests in relation to the kidnapping of our father and grandfather,\" Baghsarian&#x27;s family said in a statement distributed by police.\"As we continue attempting to come to terms with this incident, we ask that media respect our privacy.\"The family said they would not be conducting interviews. Police have remained at the properties where the two men were arrested throughout the morning.A car was towed from the Castle Hill address, while police removed bags of evidence from the Kenthurst property.Officers at the latter also gained access to the roof cavity, and have conducted line searches through the backyard and the dense bushland at the property&#x27;s rear.&#x27;No stone unturned&#x27;Speaking on 2GB this morning, NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon backed the investigators to the hilt.\"They have left no stone unturned. They have been going been working with the community,\" Lanyon said.\"They have been reviewing both electronic evidence and CCTV. So we&#x27;re very confident, obviously.\"Officers continue to comb the crime scene where Baghsarian&#x27;s suspected remains were found this morning.NSW Premier Chris Minns said yesterday the discovery of Baghsarian&#x27;s remains was \"an incredibly tragic development\".Police said a car forensically linked to the 85-year-old was seen a day after his kidnapping near where his suspected remains were found this morning.\"While formal identification is still underway, this is an incredibly tragic development, and our thoughts are with the friends and family of Mr Baghsarian at this heartbreaking time,\" Minns said.\"This kind of brutality has no place in our community. Police will not stop until they capture those responsible and bring them before the courts. The full weight of the law must come down on these people.\"The human remains were discovered near a golf club in Pitt Town in the city&#x27;s north-west about 8am yesterday during the search for the 85-year-old.Police are awaiting testing to positively identify the remains as Baghsarian.WEATHER: State warned to brace for thunderstorms and flash floodingA grey Toyota Corolla forensically linked to an abandoned stronghold in Dural was spotted in Pitt Town about 9pm on February 14, police said.Police believe those who kidnapped Baghsarian may have taken the grandfather to the property after the abduction.During a raid, officers seized evidence, including disturbing images of the missing grandfather with his alleged kidnappers.Videos of Baghsarian have also been sent to police.The car, which had cloned plates but is believed to have been stolen from Victoria, was found burnt out on Good Street in Westmead on February 16.It had cloned plates of DVT007 , and the Victorian registration 1UZ2BU.Detective Acting Superintendent Andrew Mark said information regarding the investigation led police to the golf course.\"We&#x27;ve traced that vehicle that we suspect was involved and that can forensically link the vehicle to Mr Baghsarian, and to the stronghold that we have spoken about in Dural,\" Marks said.\"Putting that together is why we believe it&#x27;s Mr Baghsarian.\"An autopsy will be conducted. Baghsarian&#x27;s family are \"deeply upset\" by the discovery and have asked for privacy.Police will now focus efforts on identifying the offenders.\" The efforts that have gone in, and the response that has come from the public, we&#x27;re all outraged that this has happened to an innocent man,\" Marks said.\"I am proud of the police and the efforts. Police have been working 24 hours a day since Friday the 13th.\"Marks said he is confident investigators will use every resource available to bring the perpetrators to justice.WEATHER: State warned to brace for thunderstorms and flash floodingThe search for Baghsarian 9News understands the remains were wrapped up in what appeared to be a carpet or towel.Police searched dense bushland near Glenorie, about 15 minutes further east, earlier in the week.Shortly before 9am yesterday, a number of police vehicles left that search base to travel to a patch of overgrown grassland near Pitt Town Bottoms Road.Once they arrived at the location, a blue tent - signifying the location of the remains - was raised in minutes. The overgrown piece of land is located in semi-rural surroundings, with businesses including turf farms nearby.Police on the scene this morning included tactical, general duties, and forensics officers as well as investigators.The area has been carefully combed, with officers conducting line searches around where the remains were found.
