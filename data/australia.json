          "standfirst": "Austin Tucker Martin has been named as the gunman shot dead by US Secret Service agents at Mar-a-Lago.",
          "content": "A shotgun-wielding man shot dead at US President Donald Trump&#x27;s residence at Mar-a-Lago in Florida has been identified as a 21-year-old from a family of Trump supporters.The US Secret Service said earlier an armed man has been shot and killed after entering the secure perimeter of Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump&#x27;s resort in Palm Beach, Florida.Although Trump often spends weekends at his resort, he was at the White House during the incident about 1.30am (5.30pm AEDT) on Sunday. First lady Melania Trump was also with the president.READ MORE: Rare $1m offer over singer found dead in jammed liftAccording to the Secret Service, he was \"observed by the north gate of the Mar-a-Lago property carrying what appeared to be a shotgun and a fuel can\".After entering near the north gate of the property, the man was confronted by two Secret Service agents and a Palm Beach County sheriff&#x27;s deputy, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw.\"He was ordered to drop those two pieces of equipment that he had with them. At which time he put down the petrol can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position,\" Bradshaw said.The two agents and the deputy \"fired their weapons to neutralise the threat\".READ MORE: Former &#x27;American Idol&#x27; contestant charged with murdering wife, staging crime sceneThe FBI asked residents who live near Mar-a-Lago to check any security cameras they may have for footage that could help investigators.The man killed was identified by investigators as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin, according to a person familiar with the matter, Associated Press reported.The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to publicly discuss details of the investigation.The suspect was reported missing in North Carolina a few days ago by his family. Investigators believe he left North Carolina and headed south, picking up a shotgun along the way, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said, who added that the box for the gun was recovered in his vehicle.READ MORE: Police probe home as hunt for kidnapped Sydney grandfather continues Guglielmi said that the man drove through the north gate of Mar-a-Lago as another vehicle was exiting.Investigators are working to compile a psychological profile and a motive is still under investigation. Asked whether the individual was known to law enforcement, Bradshaw said \"not right now\".Braeden Fields, Martin&#x27;s cousin, reacted with disbelief. He described Martin as quiet, afraid of guns and from a family of avid Trump supporters.\"He&#x27;s a good kid,\" Fields, 19, said. He said they grew up together. \"I wouldn&#x27;t believe he would do something like this. It&#x27;s mind-blowing,\" Fields said.He said Martin worked at a local golf course and would send money from each paycheck to charity.\"He wouldn&#x27;t even hurt an ant. He doesn&#x27;t even know how to use a gun,\" Fields said.He said his cousin didn&#x27;t discuss politics.\"We are big Trump supporters, all of us. Everybody,\" Fields said, but his cousin was \"real quiet, never really talked about anything.\"US rocked by political violence The US has been rocked multiple times in recent years by political violence. Just last year, that included the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the assassination of the Democratic leader in the Minnesota state House and her husband and the shooting of another lawmaker and his wife, and an arson attack at the official residence of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.The incursion on Saturday at Trump&#x27;s Florida home is a few kilometres from his West Palm Beach golf club where a man tried to assassinate Trump while he played golf during the 2024 election.A Secret Service agent spotted that man, Ryan Routh, aiming a rifle through the shrubbery before Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire and caused Routh to drop his weapon.Routh was found guilty last year and sentenced this month to life in prison.Trump also survived an assassination attempt at a Butler, Pennsylvania campaign rally in 2024. That gunman fired eight shots before being killed by a Secret Service counter sniper.https://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/2025596613738000645Regarding the latest incident, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X that \"the United States Secret Service acted quickly and decisively to neutralise a crazy person, armed with a gun and a gas canister, who intruded President Trump&#x27;s home.\"Leavitt used her post to blame Democratic lawmakers in Congress for the partial government shutdown affecting the Homeland Security department that began February 14 after Democrats demanded changes to the president&#x27;s deportation campaign.The Secret Service is among the agencies where the vast majority of employees are continuing their work but missing a paycheck.\"Federal law enforcement are working 24/7 to keep our country safe and protect all Americans,\" Leavitt said. \"It&#x27;s shameful and reckless that Democrats have chosen to shut down their Department.\"The White House referred all questions to the Secret Service and FBI.Both Trump and his wife posted statements on social media after the incident, but they were unrelated to the shooting.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
