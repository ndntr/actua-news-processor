Palmer has announced that he will be challenging the international tribunal&#x27;s decision in Switzerland&#x27;s Federal Supreme Court. He said this was the \" next step in the journey to achieve justice in the matter, hopeful of the final arbiter taking an opposite view to that of the tribunal\".DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has visited Balmoral Castle for a private meeting with King Charles III.Albanese and fiance Jodie Haydon flew to Scotland overnight for the face-to-face visit, which the prime minister described as a privilege and a \"great honour\".The King only two weeks ago praised the AUKUS defence pact between Australia, the US and Britain during Donald Trump&#x27;s state visit to the UK. READ MORE: Investigation as bodies of woman, 61, and man in his 60s found in NSW home The prime minister will tomorrow speak at the UK Labour Party conference in Liverpool before travelling to the United Arab Emirates. Earlier, Albanese joined the British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in discussing defence, security, trade and the economy.Top of the agenda was how to protect the AUKUS pact from being unpicked by Donald Trump&#x27;s America First agenda.The US President&#x27;s unique brand of populism has been matched in Britain by Nigel Farage&#x27;s Reform party which is leading the UK polls.Farage is riding a wave of anti-immigration sentiment helped along by rallies stoked by far-right activists.March for Australia protests have also been held in major cities over the past few weeks. \"That sends shivers through the spines on many of our communities,\" Starmer said.\"I don&#x27;t want to see the rise of populist organisations,\" Albanese added.READ MORE: Trump says he&#x27;s sending troops to Portland to protect ICE facilitiesThe British Prime Minister hosted his Australian counterpart at Number 10.Albanese said: \"We share values and today more so than ever really.\"Later, he was seen heading into the famous door with some Aussie-brewed beers with partner Haydon.He clutched a four-pack of his own Albo brew by Willie The Boatman in Sydney.READ MORE: Man dies after plane owned by skydiving business crashesAlbanese and Starmer are both from the progressive side of politics.Albanese scored a thumping re-election in May.The other is facing an early reckoning just 14 months after winning power.The British public is increasingly concerned about illegal migrants, with many crossing the English Channel in boats.The British PM has announced a mandatory digital ID in a bid to stamp out illegal workers.Albanese declined to say whether he recommended Sir Keir learn the lesson of the Australian Labor Party and muscle up in border control.",
