Director of South Eastern Sydney Local Health District&#x27;s Public Health Unit, Dr Vicky Sheppeard, said while the potential risk of infection is low, blood-borne viruses can have serious health impacts.\"Any current or former patients of Mr Hasic should see their GP as soon as possible and ask to be tested for blood-borne viruses as a precautionary measure,\" Sheppeard said.\"Blood-borne viruses can be spread between clients on dental instruments where there isn&#x27;t stringent infection control.\"People infected with blood-borne viruses may not show symptoms for many years, so it is important to be tested to see if there is silent infection.\"There are effective treatments for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.\"Patients who have had tests after their last visit with Hasic should check with their GP if more tests are needed, even if results were negative.NSW Health is working with the Dental Council of NSW and Health Care Complaints Commission to investigate.Sign up here to receive our daily newsletters and breaking news alerts, sent straight to your inbox.",
