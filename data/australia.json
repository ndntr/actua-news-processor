Families have been told the operation is now considered a recovery, meaning the final missing skier is not expected to be found alive. The area near Donner Summit is one of the snowiest places in the western hemisphere and until just a few years ago was closed to the public.READ MORE: Ute found after man killed in horror wrong-way crash on major highway It sees an average of nearly 10 metres of snow a year, according to the Truckee Donner Land Trust, which owns a cluster of huts where the group was staying near Frog Lake.The Sierra Avalanche Centre warned that the risk of avalanche remains high and advised against travel in the area.Heavy snowfall and gale-force winds in recent days left the snowpack unstable and unpredictable, and more snow was predicted to fall, the centre said.Nevada County Sheriff Captain Russell Greene said authorities were notified about the avalanche by Blackbird Mountain Guides, which was leading the expedition, and the skiers&#x27; emergency beacons.Of the survivors, one was a guide and five were clients.The skiers were on the last day of a back-country skiing trip and had spent two nights in the Frog Lake huts, said Steve Reynaud, an avalanche forecaster with the Sierra Avalanche Centre. He said the area requires navigating rugged mountainous terrain. All food and supplies need to be carried to the huts.Reaching the huts in winter takes several hours and requires backcountry skills, avalanche training and safety equipment, the land trust says on its website.Blackbird Mountain Guides said in a statement said the group, including four guides, was returning to the trailhead when the avalanche occurred.\"Our thoughts are with the missing individuals, their families, and first responders in the field,\" Blackbird said in a statement. The company said it is helping authorities in the search.\"The leadership team at Blackbird Mountain Guides remains fully engaged in assisting the search and rescue efforts on the ground as we navigate this incredibly difficult situation alongside those involved,\" an update to the original statement read.Several Tahoe ski resorts had been fully or partially closed due to the weather. Resorts, which use controlled explosions and barriers to manage avalanche threats, were not expected to be at as high of a risk as the back country, the centre said.The area near Donner Summit was closed for nearly a century before the land trust and its partners in 2020 acquired Frog Lake, which is framed by 300m-high cliffs.Donner Summit is named for the infamous Donner Party, a group of pioneers who resorted to cannibalism after getting trapped there in the winter of 1846-1847.In January, an avalanche in the region buried a snowmobiler and killed him, authorities said. Each winter, 25 to 30 people die in avalanches in the US, according to the National Avalanche Centre.With Associated Press.

          "content": "Mark Zuckerberg and opposing lawyers have duelled in a Los Angeles courtroom, where the Meta chief executive answered questions about young people&#x27;s use of Instagram, his congressional testimony and internal advice he&#x27;s received about being \"authentic\" and not \"robotic\".Zuckerberg&#x27;s testimony is part of an unprecedented social media trial that questions whether Meta&#x27;s platforms deliberately addict and harm children.As of early afternoon on Wednesday (Thursday AEDT), Zuckerberg has not directly answered the central question of the case: whether Instagram is addictive. The plaintiff&#x27;s lawyer, Mark Lanier, asked if people tend to use something more if it&#x27;s addictive.READ MORE: Gaming platform Roblox to be tested on child safety as concerns grow \"I&#x27;m not sure what to say to that,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I don&#x27;t think that applies here.\"Lawyers representing the plaintiff, a now 20-year-old woman identified by the initials KGM, claim her early use of social media addicted her to the technology and exacerbated depression and suicidal thoughts. Meta Platforms and Google&#x27;s YouTube are the two remaining defendants in the case, which TikTok and Snap have settled.Beginning his questioning, Lanier laid out three options of what people can do regarding vulnerable people: help them, ignore them, or \"prey upon them and use them for our own ends.\"Zuckerberg said he agrees the last option is not what a reasonable company should do, saying, \"I think a reasonable company should try to help the people that use its services.\"When he was asked about his compensation, Zuckerberg said he has pledged to give \"almost all\" of his money to charity, focusing on scientific research. Lanier asked him how much money he has pledged to victims impacted by social media, to which Zuckerberg replied, \"I disagree with the characterisation of your question.\"READ MORE: Murder accused had absconded from mental health facility days before western Sydney stabbing spreeLanier questioned the Meta chief executive extensively about a comment he made during a past congressional hearing, where he said Instagram employees are not given goals to increase amount of time people spent on the platform.Lanier presented internal documents that seemed to contradict that statement. Zuckerberg replied that they previously had goals associated with time, but said he and the company made the conscious decision to move away from those goals, focusing instead on utility. He said he believes in the \"basic assumption\" that \"if something is valuable, people will use it more because it&#x27;s useful to them.\"Lanier also asked Zuckerberg about what he characterised as extensive media training, including for testimonies like the one he was giving in court. Lanier pointed to an internal document about feedback on Zuckerberg&#x27;s tone of voice on his own social media, imploring him to come off as \"authentic, direct, human, insightful and real,\" and instructing him to \"not try hard, fake, robotic, corporate or cheesy\" in his communication.Zuckerberg pushed back against the idea that he&#x27;s been coached on how to respond to questions or present himself, saying those offering the advice were \"just giving feedback.\"Regarding his media appearances and public speaking, Zuckerberg said, \"I think I&#x27;m actually well known to be sort of bad at this.\"The case, along with two others, has been selected as a bellweather trial, meaning its outcome could impact how thousands of similar lawsuits against social media companies are likely to play out.A Meta spokesperson said the company strongly disagrees with the allegations in the lawsuit and said they are \"confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.\"NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
