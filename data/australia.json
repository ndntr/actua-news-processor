          "content": "Two boys killed in a suspected machete attack in Melbourne&#x27;s west were on their way home from basketball when they were ambushed in a potential case of mistaken identity.Dau Akueng, 15, and Chol Achiek, 12, were walking from a bus stop in Cobblebank with a third friend just before 8pm yesterday when they were set upon by up to eight masked people. The pair were found critically injured on the street about 200 metres apart in what police have described as having \"the hallmarks of a youth gang crime\". Neighbours reported hearing their screams and rushed outside to help but it was too late.\" It&#x27;s absolutely shocking that not one, but two could happen so close to home, at 8 o&#x27;clock at night,\" one neighbour told 9News.Police said the victims weren&#x27;t gang members and were investigating if their deaths were a horrific case of mistaken identity.The boy&#x27;s grieving family and friends are pleading for justice.Dau&#x27;s father said he needed answers for his son.\"This is a basketball player, he&#x27;s not a criminal,\" Elbino Akueng said.\"I&#x27;m talking on behalf of my community, this is happening to us.READ MORE: Man dies after early morning shooting in Melbourne&#x27;s CBD\"In the last month, we have buried four kids, similar incidents keep happening, but there&#x27;s no answer from police.\" Emergency services first found Chol, who paramedics tried to resuscitate but couldn&#x27;t save.Chol&#x27;s father, Cauti Nuong, described him as a \"good boy\" who was very clever.\"Very intelligent, he&#x27;s always so active,\" he told 9News. Detective Inspector Graham Banks said Dau, 15, was found dead a short time later nearby on Cobble Street as a result of \"significant injuries consistent with being stabbed\".He added that Chol and Dau were not gang members.

Dau has been remembered as a bright and talented young basketballer. Collingwood Basketball Association (CBA) general manager Trent Pearson said he was a \"much-loved member\" of the club.\"He was a highly talented player and referee with a cheerful personality who touched all those he interacted with over many years,\" Pearson said.\"Dau had a smile and confidence that were infectious and his love for basketball and being around his friends will be sorely missed.\"\"As a club we are devastated by his passing. I&#x27;ve spoken today to the family and our focus now, is supporting them and our club members in coming to terms with the tragic loss of a beautiful young man.\"CBA vice president Duré De Winter said Dau \"brightened everyone&#x27;s day with his smile\" and spoke of his maturity on and off the court.\" We are heartbroken to lose such a beautiful young man. Our thoughts and condolences go to his family and community, they are a strong and beautiful community,\" Winter said.\"We are so sorry for their loss.\"Police and the NSW State Emergency Service spent the night in the street gathering evidence. \"The exact circumstances surrounding the deaths are still being determined but are believed to be connected,\" Victoria Police said in a statement earlier today.\"At this time police are treating it as a targeted attack and the investigation remains ongoing.\"Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
