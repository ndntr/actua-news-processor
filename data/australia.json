All marketing materials will be required to reflect the honest reserve price too. \"Underquoting isn&#x27;t fair and it&#x27;s young Victorians and families paying the price,\" Staikos said today.\"That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re stamping it out by requiring reserve prices to be published at least seven days before an auction.READ MORE: One disease wiped out Steph&#x27;s family in a year. Survival rates have barely changed\"We want the housing market to be fair – that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re continuing to crack down on underquoting with strong laws, a dedicated taskforce and active enforcement.\"The Labor government said its underquoting taskforce has issued over 200 infringements totalling over $2.3 million in fines.In response, the Victorian Greens said it supported the fresh underquoting laws but warned it may not have any impact on housing affordability. The Greens claimed underquoting has \"run rampant\" in the state, which has fuelled competition and driven prices up.\"Labor&#x27;s finally catching. First-home buyers have been getting completely screwed for years, wasting time and spending thousands on inspections for homes they were never going to afford,\" said Victorian Greens housing spokesperson Gabrielle de Vietri.\"Being told the reserve early is helpful, but it doesn&#x27;t change the reality that most young people can&#x27;t afford the reserve in the first place.\"Similar laws were introduced this month in NSW, which penalises dodgy real estate agents who put misleading price estimates in property listings.

That has been disclosed to (prosecutors). It does give a reference to a potential section 27 defence.\"Section 27 of the Queensland criminal code is an insanity defence that a person is not criminally responsible for an act if they were delusional or did not have the mental capacity to control their actions or know they were wrong.Taufua&#x27;s case should be immediately referred to the Mental Health Court, Longhurst told Justice Elizabeth Wilson.That court decides whether an alleged offender was of unsound mind.Taufua stood in the dock wearing gold-rimmed glasses and a black dress with a yellow flower pattern.Police will allege that she was fleeing police before ploughing into an oncoming vehicle, killing Chris Fawcett, 79, Susan Zimmer, 70, and her 35-year-old daughter Steffanie.Longhurst told the Supreme Court in October Taufua had struggled to accept the death of her child.READ MORE: Warning entire industry critical for Australian economy on the brink of collapse\"In the time leading up to the driving, the defendant had been displaying very aberrant behaviour,\" Longhurst said.Chace Haas, 21, died in Gold Coast Hospital in August 2020.He had lived his entire life using a wheelchair after breaking his neck in a car accident at just five months of age.It would be extraordinary for a case that has been running since December 2022 to have a referral to the Mental Health Court at this stage, crown prosecutor Dejana Kovac said.\"It&#x27;s very unfortunate for the parents of the deceased,\" Ms Kovac said.\"It&#x27;s a position that could have been avoided had these issues been sorted out earlier than yesterday at 4.58pm. The prolonged process has already had an impact on the families.\"Taufua - the mother of Brisbane Broncos forward Payne and Gold Coast Titans rising star Klese Haas - was the crash&#x27;s sole survivor.Taufua was on parole at the time of the crash after being sentenced to nine months in prison for assaulting two security guards at The Star casino.She was subsequently returned to custody after the collision.READ MORE: Bizarre twist as owner charged over death of Arnie the German shepherdIn November 2024, Taufua was committed to stand trial after conceding she had a prima facie case to answer.Justice Wilson said she would suspend Taufua&#x27;s Supreme Court matter.Taufua was remanded in custody and her case will return to the Supreme Court in February for an update on the Mental Health Court&#x27;s progress.Readers seeking support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or beyond blue on 1300 22 4636.
