          "content": "Accused cop killer Dezi Freeman faces brutal weather this weekend that could also hamper the search efforts, as it&#x27;s revealed his wife and a 15-year-old boy have been arrested as hundreds of officers are deployed in the manhunt.More than four days after the ambush murder of two police officers, Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Mike Bush said more than 450 officers were now involved in the \"very professional and coordinated operation\" to apprehend Freeman .Search teams are facing even further complications than the rough terrain around where Freeman allegedly fled into bushland on Tuesday.READ MORE: Amid calls to fast-track the national gun register, one expert says a different issue is far more pressingPorepunkah is currently under a severe weather warning for damaging winds, and the region is also forecast to receive plenty of rain amid freezing overnight lows in the coming days.On Thursday, Freeman&#x27;s partner Mali Freeman, 42, and a 15-year-old boy were arrested just after 8.30pm after 12 police vehicles surrounded a property in Porepunkah, about 300 kilometres from Melbourne.Officers dismounted and surrounded a property as a loudspeaker advised people inside to come out with nothing in their hands.\"There&#x27;s a lot of cops dressed up in all sorts of gear,\" a neighbour told 9News.\"Very scary, with the two little kids at home. Luckily, they slept through it.\"About 10 people walked from the home before they were searched.Officers led away a woman and a baby.Mali Freeman and the teenager were interviewed and released without charge, pending further enquiries.Bush said they were \"interviewed totally and specifically related to the homicide investigation\".\"There may or may not be charges that follow, but it would be very inappropriate for me to say anything else at his point,\" he said.Fugitive may be using technology to aid evasion from policeHigh country fugitive Dezi Freeman may be using technology to help him hide from authorities, Bush said.Bush refused to reveal details about the police search for the accused killer, in fear it may assist him to evade police.\"It&#x27;s quite possible that the suspect at large has access to technology, so it would be very unwise of me, on behalf of my investigation and search team to share further information,\" Bush said.&#x27;We are not leaving&#x27;: Police from across the country rush to rural townMore than 450 police officers from Victoria, NSW, SA, the ACT and AFP are now involved in the \"very professional and coordinated operation\" to apprehend Freeman.\"Some are involved in search, some are involved in investigations, some are involved in supporting, and many are involved in community reassurance,\" Bush said.\"We&#x27;re also joined in that operation by Ambulance Victoria, the fire department, the local fire department, and we&#x27;re really, really appreciative of their efforts.\"Bush assured the local community that emergency services \"are not leaving here until this person is in custody\".\"We have many officers out in the field to keep you safe.\"Our partners from across other states, if they&#x27;re not here already, they&#x27;re on their way to support us\"All of our law enforcement colleagues and partners across Austrlia are leaning into this with us.\"Commissioner probed on Freeman&#x27;s firearm license Bush revealed Freeman&#x27;s firearm license had been revoked before the deadly shooting.He refused to elaborate on whether he had transferred ownership of his firearms to somebody close to him.\"Of course that forms an offence, which also relates to the search warrants last night, in relation to how someone can be unlawfully in possession of firearms,\" Bush said. \"It forms part of the investigation and could form part of the prosecution if that does occur.\"Bush also issued a direct message to the suspected gunman. \"If that person is listening, it really is time to lay down your firearms and give yourself up, so that we can all bring this to a safe conclusion and this community can get back to what they love to do,\" he said.Funeral arrangements under way Bush gave a condition update on the third police officer seriously wounded in Tuesday&#x27;s fatal shooting .\"He&#x27;s had one operation. He will have another. He will recover. He&#x27;s in good hands,\" Bush said.Funeral arrangements for Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim de Waart were being organised, Bush said.\"We are not at a position yet to announce funeral arrangements, but those arrangements are progressing very well and we&#x27;ll be able to share that with you at some point,\" Bush said.Senior Victoria Police and state officials including the premier have met with the families of both fallen officers. \"In the last few days we have met with Neil&#x27;s wife, Lisa, to give her every support,\" Bush said.\"I&#x27;ve also spoken to Vadim&#x27;s aunty, who lives in Melbourne, to offer them every support.\"Premier Jacinta Allan, Police Minister Anthony Carbines added to a growing floral tribute at Wangaratta Police Station.No sightings since manhunt commenced Earlier today, police confirmed there have been no sightings of accused gunman Dezi Freeman since Tuesday.Porepunkah has been in lockdown since three police officers were shot when executing a search warrant, two fatally.The man believed responsible, Dezi Freeman, also known as Desmond Filby, remains at large.Also overnight, an emotional vigil was held in the town of Wangaratta for one of the officers shot dead in the attack.The town is where Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson, 59, used to work. He was only two weeks away from retirement when he died.Freeman is accused of shooting dead Thompson and Constable Vadim De Waart on Tuesday morning at a home in Porepunkah.A third officer was allegedly shot and wounded in the leg and is recovering in hospital.Freeman is a self-described \"sovereign citizen\" who is known to police.According to the Australian Federal Police, a sovereign citizen – also known as a SovCit – seeks to \"disassociate from society and refuses to engage with societal requirements like paying tax\".Police said he had several firearms on him, with senior officers confirming police had not recovered any weapons used in the attack. Hundreds of officers and specialist police have swarmed the small country town as Victoria Police commit every resource available to track down and apprehend Freeman.Police are still working on the theory that the accused gunman remains in the Porepunkah area.Deputy Commissioner of Regional Operations Russell Barrett said yesterday the search area had been expanded but Freeman was believed to be close by.He also said the manhunt had been taking longer than expected. The rough terrain has been making the search difficult.
