Police searched an Equestrian Drive address in Maudsland at 5.11am today.A 49-year-old man was arrested and charged with domestic violence murder and misconduct with a corpse.Detective Inspector Wayne Francis could not confirm the nature of Beale&#x27;s relationship with the man but said police will allege there was a history of domestic violence. Francis said Beale&#x27;s children were doing \"as best they can\" given the circumstances.\"They&#x27;ve lost their mother through horrible circumstances, no matter what court action occurs subsequently, they can&#x27;t get their mother back,\" he said.Police are still keen for anyone with information to still come forward.Francis said a White Ford Ranger was identified as a car of interest during the investigation. \"I would just like to thank the investigators involved for their dedication and professionalism,\" he added. The charged man is expected to appear in court today. Support is available from the National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service at 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732).",
