READ MORE: Putin praises Trump&#x27;s peace efforts after he failed to win Nobel prize \"For the past few months, both sides have participated in several back-channel meetings and calls.\"The communication between the Russian president and the US first lady is unusual and reflects a minor bright spot in what have otherwise been largely futile attempts by Washington to end the war that Russia started with its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.President Trump, who has long touted a strong relationship with Putin and invited him to a summit in Alaska in August, has expressed frustration with the Russian leader in recent weeks for not ending the war, which Trump had promised as a candidate to do within a day.Trump delivered a letter from his wife to Putin at the Alaska meeting.Ukraine has called the abductions of tens of thousands of its children to Russia or Russian-occupied territory without the consent of family or guardians a war crime that meets the UN treaty definition of genocide. Previously Moscow has said it has been protecting vulnerable children from a war zone.The first lady said on Friday her representative was working directly with Putin&#x27;s team to secure the safe reunification of children with their families between Russia and Ukraine.Eight children had been returned to their families within the last 24 hours, she said.\"Russia continues to cooperate with the United States in various areas, including humanitarian ones. We appreciate Melania Trump&#x27;s humanitarian leadership,\" said Russia&#x27;s presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who was involved in discussions.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday praised US President Donald Trump&#x27;s peace efforts, despite not winning a Nobel, and voiced hope for securing an agreement to extend a pivotal nuclear arms pact with Washington for another year.Asked by reporters whether he thinks Trump was unjustly passed over for the Nobel Peace Prize in favor of Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, Putin replied that he wasn&#x27;t the one to decide but extolled Trump&#x27;s efforts toward a ceasefire in Gaza and in Ukraine.\"He&#x27;s really doing a lot to resolve such complex crises that have lasted for years and even decades,\" Putin said of Trump while in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, for a summit of former Soviet nations.He added that if the Gaza ceasefire deal is carried out, it would mark a \"historic\" achievement.The Russian leader didn&#x27;t comment on Machado&#x27;s win, but he said without mentioning any names that the Nobel Committee in the past has awarded the prize to those who have accomplished little to help global peace.\"There have been cases where the committee has awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to people who have done nothing for peace,\" Putin said. \"A person comes, good or bad, and (gets it) in a month, in two months, boom. For what? He didn&#x27;t do anything at all. In my view, these decisions have done enormous damage to the prestige of this prize.\"Putin wasn&#x27;t the only one to heap praise on the US President for brokering the deal.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and UN Secretary-General António Guterres all issued similarly worded statements noting Trump&#x27;s efforts, after Israel confirmed the first phase of the deal had been ratified.\"This is a moment of profound relief that will be felt all around the world, but particularly for the hostages, their families, and for the civilian population of Gaza, who have endured unimaginable suffering over the last two years,\" Starmer noted. Guterres said \"the UN will support the full implementation of the agreement\" and they plan to \"scale up the delivery of sustained & principled humanitarian relief, and we will advance recovery & reconstruction efforts in Gaza\".&#x27;Complex issues&#x27; to resolve before ending Russia-Ukraine warTurning to the conflict in Ukraine that has dragged on for more than three-and-a-half years, Putin said he and Trump discussed ways to settle it at their summit in Alaska in August, adding that \"on the whole, we have an understanding, both on the part of the United States and on the part of the Russian Federation, about where we should move and what we should strive for in order to end this conflict.\"Putin said he told Trump in Alaska that he needed more time to think about it and discuss it with Russia&#x27;s allies.\"These are complex issues that require further analysis, but we remain committed to the discussion that took place in Anchorage,\" he said, adding that \"perhaps we can still accomplish a lot based on the agreements and discussions in Anchorage.\"He voiced hope that Moscow and Washington would agree to extend the 2010 New START arms reduction treaty for another year after it expires in February. The pact limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.When asked about Putin&#x27;s proposal in September to extend the New START agreement, Trump said Sunday it \"sounds like a good idea to me.\"Putin said on Friday that Russia and the US still have enough time to agree on its extension \"if there is a good will.\"He noted that \"if the American side decides that it doesn&#x27;t need it, it&#x27;s not critical for us at all,\" as Russia has upgraded its strategic nuclear arsenals and is preparing to field new weapons.At the same time, he warned that the pact&#x27;s demise would mean that there will be no arms control agreement left between the world&#x27;s two largest nuclear powers.\"We&#x27;re ready to negotiate if the Americans, the American side sees it as acceptable and useful,\" he said. \"If not, then no. It would be a pity, because there would be nothing left at all in terms of deterrence in the area of strategic offensive weapons.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "RBA Governor Michele Bullock has hit back at suggestions from the Greens that the central bank is responsible for Australia&#x27;s skyrocketing house prices in a tense parliamentary hearing.In an appearance at Senate estimates this morning, Bullock was questioned by Greens senator Nick McKim about the Reserve Bank&#x27;s role in the housing crisis.\"The $400 billion that the RBA printed in the early year or two of COVID and effectively handed over to retail banks, who then turn around and lend it into the property market, do you accept that that played a role in the housing price bubble that we&#x27;ve seen over the last five years?\" McKim asked.READ MORE: Man arrested after woman&#x27;s death at Melbourne home \"Certainly part of the way monetary policy works is through the housing market, but I would not accept that the Reserve Bank is responsible for the housing price issues in this country,\" Bullock, who wasn&#x27;t appointed as governor until 2023, replied.When challenged on that by McKim, who put to her that the RBA \"doesn&#x27;t accept any responsibility whatsoever in the housing price spike\", Bullock pointed to an oft-cited factor as the genuine culprit.\"The problem is the lack of supply relative to demand, and when monetary policy eases and housing demand picks up, supply can&#x27;t pick up as quickly, and that&#x27;s where you end up,\" she said. \"But it&#x27;s not monetary policy&#x27;s responsibility to look after housing prices.\"READ MORE: Unusual customer heads to South Australia bottle shop&#x27;s beer fridge Having previously said that it would be at least two years before Australia started to see some relief from price surges, despite governments starting to focus on increasing supply, Bullock reiterated that fixing the country&#x27;s housing stock was a long, slow process.\"It takes time to get approvals and one of the big things is higher density housing and that by its nature takes much longer,\" she said.\"It is not something that you can just turn the switch and say &#x27;alright, now we&#x27;re off and running&#x27;, it really takes time.\"Bullock also frustrated McKim by telling him investors weren&#x27;t significantly exacerbating the housing crisis at the moment, and by refusing to be drawn on whether removing the capital gains tax discount for property would slow price rises.READ MORE: Pure chance saved fourth officer from being shot by Dezi Freeman: police \"I have done no particular analysis on what removal of the capital gains tax might do,\" she said.\"It&#x27;s (not) my job to tell the government what they should do with the policy,\" she added. However, when asked by Liberal senator Andrew Bragg about the impact of the federal government&#x27;s expanded first home guarantee scheme, Bullock said it was possible it would lead to house prices going \"a little higher\" in the short-term.But as for the medium-term impacts, she said that would depend on – you guessed it – supply.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
