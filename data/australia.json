          "content": "A London march organised by far-right activist Tommy Robinson drew more than 110,000 people and became unruly as a small group of his supporters clashed with police officers who were separating them from counterprotesters.Several officers were punched, kicked and struck by bottles tossed by people at the fringes of the “Unite the Kingdom” rally on Saturday (local time - overnight Australian time), the Metropolitan Police said. Reinforcements with helmets and riot shields were deployed to support the 1000-plus officers on duty.Twenty-six police officers were injured — four who were seriously hurt, including broken teeth and a concussion, a possible broken nose and a spinal injury. At least 25 people were arrested for offences including violent disorder, assaults and criminal damage, and the investigation continues, police said.READ MORE: People are getting fired for allegedly celebrating Charlie Kirk&#x27;s murder “There is no doubt that many came to exercise their lawful right to protest, but there were many who came intent on violence,\" Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said.“They confronted officers, engaging in physical and verbal abuse and making a determined effort to breach cordons in place to keep everyone safe.”The rally drew an estimated crowd of between 110,000 and 150,000 people, far surpassing expectations, police said. The rival “March Against Fascism” protest organised by Stand Up To Racism had about 5000 marchers.Anti-migrant themeRobinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, founded the nationalist and anti-Islam English Defence League and is one of the most influential far-right figures in Britain.The march was billed as a demonstration in support of free speech — with much of the rhetoric by influencers and several far-right politicians from across Europe aimed largely at the perils of migration, a problem much of the continent is struggling to control.“We are both subject to the same process of the great replacement of our European people by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture, you and we are being colonised by our former colonies,” far-right French politician Eric Zemmour said.READ MORE: Father&#x27;s intuition led to the arrest of suspect in Charlie Kirk&#x27;s murder Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO and owner of the X platform who has waded into British politics several times this year, was beamed in by video and condemned the left-leaning UK government.“There’s something beautiful about being British and what I see happening here is a destruction of Britain, initially a slow erosion, but rapidly increasing erosion of Britain with massive uncontrolled migration,\" he said.Robinson told the crowd in a hoarse voice that migrants now had more rights in court than the “British public, the people that built this nation\".The marches come at a time when the UK has been divided by debate over migrants crossing the English Channel in overcrowded inflatable boats to arrive on shore without authorisation.Numerous anti-migrant protests were held this summer outside hotels housing asylum-seekers following the arrest of an Ethiopian man who was later convicted of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in a London suburb. Some of those protests became violent and led to arrests.READ MORE: Bullets riddle suburban home with women and teenager inside Sea of flagsParticipants in the “Unite the Kingdom” march carried the St George’s red-and-white flag of England and the Union Jack and chanted “we want our country back.”UK flags have proliferated this summer across the country — at events and on village lampposts — in what some have said is a show of national pride and others said reflects a tilt toward nationalism.Supporters held signs saying “stop the boats,” “send them home,” and “enough is enough, save our children\".At the counterprotest, the crowd held signs saying “refugees welcome” and ”smash the far right,” and shouted “stand up, fight back\".Robinson supporters chanted crude refrains about UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the leader of the centre-left Labour Party, and also shouted messages of support for slain US conservative activist Charlie Kirk.Several speakers paid tribute to Kirk, who was remembered in a moment of silence, followed by a bagpiper playing Amazing Grace.One demonstrator held a sign saying: “Freedom of speech is dead. RIP Charlie Kirk.”READ MORE: These siblings started a business with a few hundred bucks. It&#x27;s made $20 million Crowd covered blocks of LondonThe crowd at one point stretched from Big Ben across the River Thames and around the corner beyond Waterloo train station, a distance of about a kilometre.The marches had been mostly peaceful, but toward the late afternoon, “Unite the Kingdom” supporters threw items at the rival rally and tried to break through barriers set up to separate the groups, police said. Officers had to use force to keep a crowd-control fence from being breached.Counterprotesters heckled a man with blood pouring down his face who was being escorted by police from the group of Robinson supporters. It wasn’t immediately clear what happened to him.While the crowd was large, it fell far short of one of the biggest recent marches when a pro-Palestinian rally drew an estimated 300,000 people in November 2023.Robinson had planned a “Unite the Kingdom” rally last October, but couldn’t attend after being jailed for contempt of court for violating a 2021 High Court order barring him from repeating libellous allegations against a Syrian refugee who successfully sued him. He previously served jail time for assault and mortgage fraud.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Like thousands of Americans captivated by the manhunt for the shooter who killed conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, a Utah father had seen the photos and video footage of the suspect released by authorities.The man in the images, dressed in a black T-shirt plastered with an eagle and American flag, could be seen jumping off the roof of a Utah university building after the shooting and running into a wooded area. His face was partially concealed by a dark pair of sunglasses and a baseball cap.But the father recognised the man.READ MORE: Alleged killer of Charlie Kirk attempted to get his friend involved in the plot\"Tyler, is this you? This looks like you,\" he asked his son, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.His son, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, confessed to his father that he had shot Kirk, the official told CNN.\"I would rather kill myself than turn myself in,\" Robinson responded when his father urged him to turn himself in to authorities, the source said.The father persuaded Robinson to confide in a youth pastor who works with the Washington County Sheriff&#x27;s Office and the US Marshal&#x27;s Service, the law enforcement source said.A family friend ultimately contacted the Washington County Sheriff&#x27;s Office – over three hours away from the shooting scene in Orem, Utah. The office relayed the tip to authorities in Utah County and the FBI.READ MORE: What we know about Charlie Kirk shooting suspect Tyler RobinsonThat night – hours after authorities said they had \"no idea\" where exactly the suspect had gone – Robinson was in custody. It was 10pm Thursday in Utah, and state and federal officials had about two hours earlier given a news conference asking the public for help finding the suspect.\"We got him,\" Utah Governor Spencer Cox said at a news conference on Friday morning.The FBI had at that point received more than 7000 leads and tips – the most the agency received since the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, the governor said. But that one tip from Robinson&#x27;s father and family friend led to a major break in the massive manhunt.It had taken authorities more than 30 hours to track down Robinson, who they allege shot Kirk from a roof above a 3000-person event at Utah Valley University, striking him in the neck from about 189 metres away and killing him.After nearly 200 interviews, the collaboration of 20 law enforcement agencies, a $US100,000 reward announcement and a back-and-forth search in which two people were questioned and released, the FBI and the Utah Department of Public Safety finally believed they caught the perpetrator of the targeted attack.READ MORE: Charlie Kirk&#x27;s wife speaks publicly after husband&#x27;s deathThe 30-hour search for a suspectAcross the country, the killing of the prominent political figure and media personality – the latest in a string of political violence incidents – had sowed shock and confusion. A gruesome video of the shooting that sent the crowd screaming and fleeing spread through social media. In Utah and elsewhere, many waited for a suspect to be named in a case that had a series of twists and turns.On Wednesday, hours after the attack, authorities believed they had a suspect in custody. That person was questioned and later released, and so was another taken into custody later that day.As a massive manhunt for the suspect dragged on, authorities shared videos and stills of a suspect, asking for tips from the public to help with the search.\"We cannot do our job without the public&#x27;s help,\" Cox said on Thursday night, hours before Robinson was taken into custody.READ MORE: Charlie Kirk&#x27;s alleged assassin had deep disdain for the commentatorUS President Donald Trump, who has credited Kirk with galvanising and mobilising the youth vote for him, said on Thursday that investigators were \"making big progress\" in the search for the suspect.\"Whoever did this: We will find you, we will try you, and we will hold you accountable to the furthest extent of the law,\" Cox vowed.Investigators with the FBI had evaluated forensic evidence and combed through over 11,000 leads. About 40 hours after the shooting, authorities announced they were able to fulfil Cox&#x27;s promise through Robinson&#x27;s father.\"Essentially somebody that was very close to him turned him in,\" Trump said on Fox and Friends on Friday morning.A dinner conversation and comments on DiscordSeveral clues pointed authorities to Robinson: his clothing, a dinner conversation he had with a relative and comments he made on a messaging platform.Less than four hours before the campus event that featured Kirk as a speaker began, Robinson arrived at UVU in a grey Dodge Challenger wearing a plain maroon T-shirt, light-coloured shorts, a black hat and light-coloured shoes, Cox said, citing UVU surveillance footage.He later changed his clothes on the roof and then jumped down, leaving palm impressions, smudges that authorities hoped to collect DNA from and a shoe imprint, according to a police affidavit. At some point, Robinson changed back into the same clothes he arrived in.READ MORE: Timeline shows how Charlie Kirk&#x27;s assassination and arrest of suspected gunman unfoldedThe next day – when authorities had taken the suspect into custody – Robinson was wearing an outfit that was similar to the one seen in surveillance video. And a relative confirmed Robinson had a grey Dodge Challenger.\"When he was arrested, the clothing matched the clothing he had on before the shooting here at UVU,\" Cox said.Robinson – a third-year student in an electrical apprenticeship program who grew up in the small suburban community of Washington, Utah – had in recent years become more political, one of his relatives told investigators, according to the affidavit.At a family dinner, Robinson had told his relatives that Kirk would be speaking at UVU and that he didn&#x27;t agree with his views, one relative told investigators. Robinson had no party affiliation and didn&#x27;t vote in the two most recent elections, voter registration records show.Messages Robinson is believed to have sent on messaging platform Discord stated a need to retrieve a rifle from a pick-up point, leaving the rifle in a bush, watching the area where a rifle was left and having wrapped the rifle in a towel, according to the affidavit.The messages, which Robinson&#x27;s roommate showed investigators, also refer to engraving bullets and mention a scope and rifle being unique, officials said. Another message stated that he had changed outfits.Investigators later discovered a bolt-action rifle wrapped in a towel. Inscriptions that read \"Hey, fascist! CATCH!\" and \"If you read This, you are GAY. Lmao,\" were engraved on unfired casings found with the rifle, officials said.Suspect is not speaking to investigatorsRobinson is now being held without bail at Utah County Jail on several initial charges, including aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm and obstruction of justice, according to officials. He is expected to face formal charges and will make his first court appearance on Tuesday.Following his arrest, Robinson initially spoke with some law enforcement officers but quickly went silent on Friday morning after hiring a lawyer, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.Cox had said on Wednesday that officials would pursue the death penalty against the shooting suspect.\"There is one person responsible for what happened here, and that person is now in custody and will be charged soon and will be held accountable,\" Cox said.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Catch!\" and another that appeared to reference an Italian anti-fascist song.READ MORE: China&#x27;s newest aircraft carrier sails through Taiwan Strait for the first timeRobinson grew up in Washington, Utah, and earned a scholarship to attend Utah State University after a strong academic record in high school, but dropped out after just one semester, according to public records, social media, and a university statement.Voter registration records show that Robinson is registered to vote unaffiliated with any party, although he is also listed as an \"inactive\" voter, meaning he hasn&#x27;t voted in at least the most recent two general elections.State and federal court records do not show any prior criminal cases involving him.His listed address in the probable cause statement is the six-bedroom home of his parents, who own a granite countertop business and are registered to vote as Republicans.Robinson has two younger brothers and his parents have been married for about 25 years, according to social media posts.Social media photos show Robinson wearing grey Converse shoes and sunglasses that appear similar to those worn by the shooting suspect in photos released by law enforcement earlier this week.Cox said at the press conference that a family member of Robinson had reached out to a family friend Thursday night, and the family friend told the Washington County Sheriff&#x27;s Office that \"Robinson had confessed to them or implied that he had committed the incident.\"Robinson was taken into custody around 10pm Thursday, after a 33-hour manhunt, FBI Director Kash Patel said Friday.READ MORE: What big shake-up in weather modelling means for summerRobinson&#x27;s hometown is a quiet suburb of St. George, a city in the southwest corner of the state. It&#x27;s about a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Utah Valley University, where Kirk was gunned down on Wednesday afternoon while holding a campus event.Robinson is currently enrolled as a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in St. George.Social media posts by Robinson&#x27;s mother reflect an active family with vacations to Disneyland, Hawaii, the Caribbean and Alaska. They frequently spent time outdoors — boating, fishing, riding ATVs, zip-lining and target shooting. A 2017 post shows the family visiting a military facility and posing with assault rifles. A young Robinson is shown smiling as he grips the handles of a 50-calibre heavy machine gun.\"He wouldn&#x27;t really talk to you unless you said something to him,\" said Durban Mickelson, who said Robinson would frequently buy supplies from the store where Mickelson works in St. George. \"Just always very quiet, kept to himself.\"Cox said that a family member of Robinson had told investigators that at a recent family dinner, Robinson had mentioned Kirk&#x27;s upcoming Utah Valley event, and \"they talked about why they didn&#x27;t like him and the viewpoints that he had,\" Cox said.\"The family member also stated Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate.\"The bolt-action rifle Robinson used and left in a wooded area near the campus had various phrases engraved on the bullet casings, Cox said, including \"Oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao ciao,\" which appeared to reference an Italian anti-fascist song.Other engravings hinted more at connections to online trolling and memes, including one that said, \"If you read this, you are gay LMAO.\"Robinson graduated from Pine View High School in St. George in 2021, a spokesperson for the school confirmed.He received a resident presidential scholarship to attend Utah State University, according to a Facebook video his mother posted of him reading a letter about the award.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
