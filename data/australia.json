          "content": "Severe Tropical Cyclone Mitchell has intensified to a Category 3 storm and when it makes landfall late tonight in Western Australia, it&#x27;s set to break an eight-year record.The storm is forecast to cross the coast tonight, around Onslow, according to the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), but it&#x27;s effects are already being felt in the Pilbara region.Senior Meteorologist Angus Hines said Mitchell will become \"parallel with the coast\" over the coming hours, before barrelling toward the far north-west coastline of WA.LATEST UPDATES: Get the latest weather warnings here.Hines said Mitchell is forecast to make landfall between Exmouth and Onslow late tonight, before it spins back out into the water.The storm is projected to then return to land somewhere near Carnarvon on Monday.\"It&#x27;s likely to be quite late in the day on Sunday, potentially the evening hours, by the time this tropical cyclone does reach the coast,\" Hines said.\"[It will be a] Category 3 tropical cyclone initially, then dropping to a Category 1 once it makes its way onto the country.\"Mitchell is currently located 85 kilometres north-northwest of Karratha and 200 kilometres west of Port Hedland , with wind gusts of up to 195km/h near the centre.It is forecast to move closer to Onslow this afternoon, while remaining over water as it tracks between Onslow and Exmouth, according to the BoM.Possible landfall over the southern Exmouth Gulf coast is expected tonight.Coastal regions including parts of the Pilbara to the west of Dampier are forecast to be battered by destructive wind gusts reaching up to 195km/h.High tides could cause serious flooding in the Karratha region today, before the Onslow region later this afternoon. Intense rainfall which could lead to flash flooding is also expected along the Pilbara coast, extending to the west Gascoyne region, into Monday.Karratha has been soaked by 66mm of rain since 9am yesterday.The stretch of coast Karratha and Exmouth is forecast to be battered by winds up to 190km/h.This intense weather system is expected to linger for the next few days, until at least Wednesday, as Mitchell weakens back into a storm. An emergency warning is in place between Whim Creek to Mardie, including Barrow Island and Montebello Islands, with residents told to shelter indoors immediately.\"It&#x27;s a really critical next 24 hours for residents in Karratha, Dampier and Onslow,\" Todd Smith from the Bureau of Meteorology said. Flights are already grounded, ports, shopping centres and schools are closed, along with 750 kilometres of the North West Coastal Highway.Residents and volunteers are doing what they can to brace for the incoming storm.\"The community&#x27;s ready,\" Karratha Mayor Daniel Scott said.\"They&#x27;ve been tying down their boats, their caravans, the shops are closed and we&#x27;re all just ready and waiting,\" he said.An evacuation centre was opened at the Karratha Leisureplex yesterday.Storm damage teams in Perth are preparing to head north today as the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) warns those in the Pilbara to expect the unexpected.\"It just takes one piece of tin to be picked up and flown around the area and that can become a dangerous projectile, or a branch from a tree,\" DFES Incident Controller Todd Pender said.Heavy rainfall and potential flash flooding are forecast for the area and could extend to the west Gascoyne region.\"Rainfall could cause rivers to rise and burst their banks, and flash flooding could cause areas of flooding anywhere that the rain is heavy, that can lead to road closures and potentially community isolation,\" BoM&#x27;s Senior Meteorologist Angus Hines said.While the cyclone is set to pack a punch after being upgraded to severe status, it&#x27;s set to fizzle out quickly.READ MORE: Author accused of child exploitation returns to courtHowever, forecasters warn the remnants of the system will continue to be felt across parts of the state for days to come.\"This weather system is not going to dissipate quickly as we continue into Monday and next week, we&#x27;ll see the remnants of the system, even though it won&#x27;t be a tropical cyclone anymore, are going to plunge deeply into central parts of Western Australia,\" Hines said.Mitchell is the ninth tropical cyclone in the 2025-26 season, and when it crosses the coast, it&#x27;ll be the fifth this season to do so.It would be the most cyclones to reach the mainland in eight years, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

Anthony Albanese failing Labor government to account.\"And you can count on us every single day as a united team to work very, very hard for you.\" A joint party room meeting will take place on Tuesday.Nationals leader David Littleproud said it was disappointing to see bitter division among Coalition ranks but described the issue which sparked the division as \"substantive\". He said the split was not about personalities, but over \"principles\".\"It was over a substantive issue, a matter of principle that we weren&#x27;t both afforded the time to be able to explore in a proper way, that the Albanese government tried to rush through,\" Littleproud said.He said members of his party room had agonised over the hate speech bill so much that there were tears, which led to the Coalition&#x27;s 17-day split.Littleproud added that the Coalition would return stronger to ensure it does not happen again. \"The National Party believes that we are better together. Australia will be better with us being together,\" he said.\"This was a big decision for our party room.\"READ MORE: WA braces for Severe Tropical Cyclone Mitchell to make landfall Littleproud earlier told Today he has made it \"very clear\" he was open to reunification – but only if Ley dropped her demand of a six-month suspension from the shadow cabinet for the Nationals senators who split from the Liberals.\"The reality is, we made it very clear from the start that if our shadow ministers that crossed the floor were reinstated then the Coalition could come back together,\" the Nationals leader said.\"We&#x27;ve been very consistent all the way through.\" \"I hope that, in the near future, that there is a Coalition,\" he added.\"Because that&#x27;s the only way to bring Anthony Albanese down.\" The threat of Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation has been looming large over the past week amid the bitter Coalition division.However, Littleproud said Hanson is not \"serious\" about becoming a genuine electoral opponent.\"She seems to be only coming after National and Liberal Party seats,\" he said.\"If the enemy is Anthony Albanese, as she articulates, she&#x27;s not really serious, is she?\"READ MORE: Grandmother killed after car crashed through bedroom as she slept Nine&#x27;s political editor Charles Croucher said the Nationals and Liberals needed to \"iron out\" details over reinstating the Nationals senators.\"The Nationals and Liberals, on the sidelines now, are back together to reshuffle around the parliament,\" Croucher said.\"Getting back together is a start, but it&#x27;s a long way back to any form of opposition for the Liberal and National parties.\"The entire Nationals frontbench, including Littleproud, quit in protest after three senators were dumped from the shadow ministry for voting against the government&#x27;s hate speech laws, despite the shadow cabinet agreeing to back the legislation. Bridget McKenzie, Ross Cadell and Susan McDonald broke ranks to vote against the hate speech bill in the Senate.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
