          "content": "The chief officer of an international livestock carrier is among four people who have been charged with attempting to import over half a tonne of cocaine after it was found floating off the coast of Western Australia.The initial discovery was made on November 6 after members of the public found packages tied to flotation devices about 30 kilometres offshore.The bundles were eventually collected by authorities off the coast of Lancelin, about 125 kilometres north of Perth.READ MORE: Stage set for court battle by Brittany Higgins&#x27; ex-boss in fight against governmentThe seizure turned out to be 525 kilograms of cocaine, which has a value of over $170 million.It is alleged the drugs were dropped off of an international livestock carrier which was on its way to Fremantle Harbour.A day later, a 46-year-old Croatian man, who was the chief officer of the vessel, was arrested.A blue drum and ropes similar to those found with the drugs were found in a search of the ship, whilst police also allege a CCTV camera had been blocked whilst the drugs were being offloaded.Three other men were also charged in relation to the attempted importation, with two men being tracked down by authorities after getting into distress in the open water.On November 3, emergency services were called to a boat that was taking on water off the coast of Guilderton.READ MORE: Moment of impact shown at Sea World fatal chopper crash inquestTwo men from Sydney, aged 19 and 36, were found and brought safely to shore, whilst further investigations led to the identification of a 52-year-old Perth man.It is alleged the trio made multiple attempts to retrieve the cocaine from the ocean after launching boats from the Two Rocks Boat ramp.They were all subsequently arrested, with the two Sydney men being extradited to Western Australia.The four men have been charged with multiple offences, with the 19-year-old man and the 46-year-old Croatian man facing the most severe penalties of life imprisonment if found guilty.Police say investigations are ongoing, including into the origins of the cocaine, and they believe more arrests will be made.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Panicking relatives and explosion risks confronted police after two joy flight helicopters collided mid-air outside a theme park, a coroner has heard.Four people died when the two Sea World choppers collided above the Gold Coast Broadwater and crashed on a sandbar in January 2023 during the busy summer holiday season.Almost three years later, coroner Carol Lee today opened an inquest in Brisbane into 11 critical issues surrounding one of Australia&#x27;s worst air disasters.READ MORE: Sales are luring almost half of Aussies into spending too muchGold Coast Water Police supervisor Justin Dunn arrived on scene within minutes.\"It was absolute chaos, it really was,\" acting Senior Sergeant Dunn said.Members of the public performed CPR on a woman and gave first aid to an injured young boy, Lee heard.As he approached an overturned aircraft, Dunn was given a chilling warning by a concerned bystander.\"I felt a hand on my shoulder. He said be careful of pressurised fuel lines. As they could explode,\" Dunn said.\"It was a mangled wreck.\"READ MORE: Federal government will move to ban &#x27;subscription traps&#x27;, drip pricing Dunn found people dead in an upside down helicopter before discovering passenger Winnie De Silva trapped under the rear of the aircraft.\"I introduced myself and said help was on the way. I asked for a towel to wipe the fuel from her face,\" he said.Shocking footage of the moment the two choppers collided and began to freefall was shown to the inquest as part of counsel assisting Ian Harvey&#x27;s opening address.Multiple passengers used their phones to film one of the helicopters taking off, followed five minutes later by their own chopper&#x27;s flight on a bright sunny day above turquoise water.Just 25 seconds after the second helicopter took off, it collided with a fellow Sea World-branded chopper at an altitude just under 40 metres.READ MORE: Police to carry out fresh searches for missing boy Gus Lamont at old mineshafts At least one passenger in the second helicopter is shown on video trying to get a pilot&#x27;s attention and point out the other aircraft is closing in on them.\"It&#x27;s inescapable that neither pilot saw the other pilot&#x27;s helicopter,\" Harvey said.\"How could that happen? They were two experienced pilots in modern, relatively sophisticated helicopters.\"Security camera footage showed the helicopter piloted by Ashley Jenkinson crash onto a sandbar near Sea World and roll onto its roof.Jenkinson, 40, died as well as British newlyweds Ronald and Diane Hughes - aged 65 and 67 - and Sydney mother Vanessa Tadros, 36.Tadros&#x27; husband Simon was at the inquest today.CCTV on a nearby helipad also captured the helicopter piloted by Michael James coming to a controlled landing near the first chopper&#x27;s crash site.James and nine passengers across both aircraft were injured, most of them seriously.Last year James died from an unrelated medical condition, Harvey said.Senior Sergeant Duane Killic was off duty and attending Sea World for leisure when he saw the crash.\"I observed them for five to 10 seconds. It was getting closer and I thought it must be an optical illusion as they can&#x27;t be that close,\" he told the inquest.Killic rushed to grab the manifest from the helipad to aid in the rescue effort.He ran into Tadros who was in a state of \"panic\" over his family members being on one of the helicopters.The response to the crash from emergency services, Sea World staff and civilians was \"extraordinary\", lead police investigator Detective Sergeant Dane Sheraton testified.\"I think more lives would have been lost without the response of those people,\" he said.The inquest comes months after a damning safety bureau report on the crash.A litany of factors led to the crash including limited visibility, failed radio transmissions and a lack of safety protocols, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau&#x27;s final report revealed in April.Harvey said at the time of the crash the volume of flights had been doubled for the peak holiday season.\"It was one of the busiest air corridors in the country,\" he said.The inquest is due to run for three weeks.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
