          "content": "Australia as well as the UK and Canada have formally recognised a Palestinian state.The nation&#x27;s move took formal effect on Sunday night alongside the United Kingdom and Canada.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in his statement that the three announcements were \"part of a coordinated international effort to build new momentum for a two-state solution.\"READ MORE: &#x27;Caring&#x27; woman, 71, found dead after house fire in SydneyEarlier, PM Albanese was criticised by a group of prominent US Republicans for his proposed recognition.The open letter was signed by 25 Republicans and addressed to Albanese, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canada&#x27;s Prime Minister Mark Carey; it was also sent to US President Donald Trump and the Secretary of State Marco Rubio.Prime Minister Mark Carney announced on the social platform X that Canada had recognised a Palestinian state.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed on Sunday that the UK is formally recognising a Palestinian state despite vociferous opposition from the US and Israel.Starmer said the move is intended \"to revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis.\"https://twitter.com/AlboMP/status/1969748666937459069?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwThough the move is largely symbolic, it is a historic moment as the U.K. arguably laid the groundwork for the creation of the Israeli state when it was in control of what was then known as Palestine in 1917.The announcement was widely anticipated after Starmer said in July that the UK would recognise a Palestinian state unless Israel agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza, allowed the UN to bring in aid and took other steps toward long-term peace.More than 140 other countries have already taken the step and more are expected to do so at the UN General Assembly this week, including France.Not universally agreedThe UK&#x27;s recognition of a Palestinian state comes just days after a state visit from U.S. President Donald Trump, during which he voiced his disapproval of the plan.\"I have a disagreement with the prime minister on that score,\" Trump said.Critics, including the US and the Israeli government, which has shown no interest in a two-state solution, have condemned the plans, saying it rewards Hamas and terrorism. As well as arguing that recognition is immoral, critics argue that it&#x27;s an empty gesture given that the Palestinian people are divided into two territories — the West Bank and Gaza — with no recognized international capital.Starmer has insisted that Hamas will have no role in the future of the governance of the Palestinian people and must release the Israeli hostages it still holds from the attacks on Oct. 7, 2023.READ MORE: &#x27;Guilty as hell&#x27;: Trump turns on his attorney general in extraordinary spray Historical overlayFrance and the UK have a historic role in the politics of the Middle East over the past 100 years, having carved up the region following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I.As part of that carve-up, the UK became the governing power of what was then Palestine. It was also author of the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which backed the establishment of a “national home for the Jewish people.”However, the second part of the declaration has been largely neglected over the decades. It noted “that nothing shall be done, nothing which may prejudice the civil and religious rights” of the Palestinian people.Lammy, who will represent the UK at the UN this week, said in July that this had not been upheld and represented “a historical injustice which continues to unfold.”The Palestinian head of mission in the UK Husam Zomlot told the BBC that recognition would right a colonial-era wrong.“The issue today is ending the denial of our existence that started 108 years ago, in 1917,” he said.And I think today, the British people should celebrate a day when history is being corrected, when wrongs are being righted, when recognition of the wrongs of the past are beginning to be corrected.\"Change of tackThe UK has for decades supported an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, but insisted recognition must come as part of a peace plan to achieve a two-state solution.READ MORE: Simone tried to dial triple zero six times after her husband collapsed However, the government has become increasingly worried that such a solution is becoming all but impossible – not only because of the razing of Gaza and displacement of most of its population during nearly two years of conflict, but because Israel’s government is aggressively expanding settlements in the West Bank, land Palestinians want for their future state.Much of the world regards Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, which is ostensibly run by the Palestinian Authority, as illegal.“We are working to reform the Palestinian Authority, and we have to keep two states alive for the children of both Gaza and the West Bank and East Jerusalem,\" said Lammy.Israel kills 34 people in Gaza, say health officialsIsraeli strikes killed at least 34 people in Gaza City overnight, including children, said health officials on Sunday, as Israel presses ahead with its offensive in the famine-stricken city and several countries prepare to recognize a Palestinian state.Health officials at Shifa Hospital, where most of the bodies were brought, said the dead included 14 people killed in a late-night strike om Saturday, which hit a residential block in the southern side of the city.Health staff said a nurse who worked at the hospital was among the dead, along with his wife and three children.Israel did not comment on the strikes.The latest Israeli operation, which began this week, further escalates a conflict that has roiled the Middle East and likely pushes any ceasefire further out of reach.The Israeli military, which has told Palestinians to leave, hasn&#x27;t given a timeline for the offensive, but there were indications it could take months. Israel says the operation is meant to pressure Hamas into freeing hostages and surrendering.",
