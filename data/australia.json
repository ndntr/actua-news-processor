It&#x27;s about making sure that the community has time to feel safe.\" During the initial 14 days, there was a protest held for Venezuela on Sunday following US President Donald Trump&#x27;s capture of Nicolas Maduro.A protester who wore a jacket with the phrase \"globalise the intifada\" was arrested and later released without charge.The renewed declaration means police will not accept any form 1 applications for protests in the South West Metropolitan, North West Metropolitan and Central Metropolitan policing areas.While gatherings are still allowed, anyone who causes obstructions to roads, businesses or others, behaves in an intimidating or harassing manner or causes fear in others can be ordered to move on.Anyone who fails to do so can be charged with an offence. Police also have the power to require anyone suspected of committing an offence to remove any face coverings. The declaration is in place for 14 days at a time.The NSW Police Commissioner has the power to extend the declaration for up to three months. READ MORE: Police declare &#x27;major crime&#x27; after suspicious disappearance of motherA coalition of protest groups has planned to hold a \" Genocide is a crime, Protest is Not\" rally amid the latest declaration in Sydney on January 16.Lanyon said he would assess the behaviour at any unauthorised protests and the community sentiment when the 14 days are up to determine whether to extend the declaration after January 20. \"We will consider all of those factors. It is very premature to talk about what may happen post these 14 days,\" he said.\"I&#x27;m constantly looking at the community and working very closely with the community to understand the fear and the level of comfort within the community.\"My job is to ensure public safety.\"Police Minister Yasmin Catley said police had the full support of the government.\"The NSW government unequivocally supports the commissioner&#x27;s decision and remains committed to ensuring NSW Police have the powers, resources and backing they need to keep the community safe.\" The new powers have been criticised by demonstrators and civil rights groups, who argue the rules impede the democratic right to protest. The Stop the War on Palestine group has condemned Lanyon&#x27;s decision today to extend the declaration.\"It is blatantly obvious that the ban has nothing to do with &#x27;social cohesion&#x27; and everything to do with removing democratic rights to oppose government policy and genocide,\" the group said in a statement.

READ MORE: Trump declares US will take control of Venezuela&#x27;s massive oil reservesMexico&#x27;s president rejects US interventionMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has restated her opposition to the US military intervention in Venezuela and defended her administration&#x27;s efforts to address drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States.\"We categorically reject the intervention in the internal affairs of other countries,\" Sheinbaum said during her daily news briefing on Monday (Tuesday morning AEDT).\"Latin American history is clear and overwhelming. Intervention has never brought democracy, never has generated wellbeing, nor lasting stability.\"The president noted 300 tonnes of drugs seized by Mexican authorities and a drop in homicides during her presidency, but added that the US has a responsibility to address its demand for drugs.Sheinbaum said her administration had previously agreed with the Trump administration to collaborate and coordinate while respecting each country&#x27;s sovereignty. She said regional economic integration was the path forward.China cannot accept US acting as &#x27;world&#x27;s police&#x27; China&#x27;s Foreign Minister Wang Yi alluded to the \"sudden developments\" in Venezuela during a meeting in Beijing alongside is Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar.China&#x27;s top diplomat said Beijing won&#x27;t accept any country acting as the \"world&#x27;s police\" after Maduro and his wife were captured. \"We have never believed that any country can act as the world&#x27;s police, nor do we accept that any nation can claim to be the world&#x27;s judge,\" he said.\"The sovereignty and security of all countries should be fully protected under international law.\"Australia&#x27;s reaction The response from many foreign governments around the world – including Australia – has been measured.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the Australian government urges \"all parties to support dialogue and diplomacy in order to secure regional stability and prevent escalation\", but stopped short of criticising the operation itself.\"Australia has long held concerns about the situation in Venezuela, including the need to respect democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms,\" the PM said.\"We continue to support international law and a peaceful, democratic transition in Venezuela that reflects the will of the Venezuelan people.\"\"We should live in a world where dictators and despots face justice for their crimes.\"British Prime Minister Keir Starmer initially said he was working to \"establish the facts\".In a second update posted to X, Starmer said the UK supported a transition of power in Venezuela.\"We regarded Maduro as an illegitimate President and we shed no tears about the end of his regime,\" Starmer said.French President Emmanuel Macron reacted with a similarly tempered response. \"The transition to come must be peaceful, democratic, and respectful of the will of the Venezuelan people. We hope that President Edmundo González Urrutia, elected in 2024, will be able to ensure this transition as quickly as possible,\" Macron wrote on X.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said his government would \"take our time\" to evaluate the developments in Venezuela. Merz added that \"a transition to a government legitimised by elections must be ensured\" and said \"political instability must not arise in Venezuela\".https://x.com/Keir_Starmer/status/2007540837224255602Some celebration Opposition Leader Sussan Ley said she welcomed the news and that Maduro was now facing justice after serving as an \"illegitimate president\". \"Under his rule, Venezuela has endured years of repression, systemic human rights abuses, corruption, and the crushing of basic democratic freedoms,\" Ley said in a joint statement alongside Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister Michaelia Cash.\"The Venezuelan people deserve the chance to restore their sovereignty through a peaceful return to democracy.Israel&#x27;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump in a post on X.\"Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump for your bold and historic leadership on behalf of freedom and justice,\" Netanyahu wrote.\"I salute your decisive resolve and the brilliant action of your brave soldiers.\"President of Argentina Javier Milei opted for a similarly celebratory response.\"What we have to understand is that it&#x27;s the collapse of the regime of a dictator that was rigging elections, that in the last election was badly defeated and, despite that, he clung on to power,\" he told reporters.\"That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d say that today&#x27;s news is excellent news for the free world.\"&#x27; This is deeply concerning and condemnable&#x27;Other foreign governments swiftly responded with strong criticism of the US&#x27; military action. Spa in, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay expressed \"deep concern\" for the military response in Venezuela in a joint statement.The five countries said it rejected the operations which were conducted in violation of international law.\"Such actions set an extremely dangerous precedent for regional peace and security and for the rules-based international order, in addition to endangering the civilian population,\" the statement read.\"We reiterate that the situation in Venezuela must be resolved exclusively by peaceful means, through dialogue, negotiation, and respect for the will of the Venezuelan people in all its expressions, without external interference and in accordance with international law.\"Brazil&#x27;s President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva posted his own statement on X and claimed the strikes and Maduro&#x27;s capture crosses an unacceptable line.\"T hese acts represent a grave affront to Venezuela&#x27;s sovereignty and yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community.\" he said.\"Attacking countries in flagrant violation of international law is the first step toward a world of violence, chaos, and instability, where the law of the strongest prevails over multilateralism.\" The Mexican Ministry for Foreign Affairs initially said it \"strongly condemns and rejects the military actions carried out unilaterally in recent hours by the armed forces of the United States of America against targets in the territory of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in clear violation of Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations\".Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that while Spain did not recognise Maduro&#x27;s regime, his government also does not recognise an intervention that is a violation of international law and of which \" pushes the region toward a horizon of uncertainty and belligerence\".READ MORE: Operation Absolute Resolve: The US mission to capture Maduro\"We call on all actors to think of the civilian population, to respect the United Nations Charter, and to articulate a fair and dialogued transition,\" Sanchez said.Russia&#x27;s foreign ministry condemned the action as an \"act of armed aggression\". \"The pretexts used to justify such actions are unfounded. Ideological animosity has prevailed over business pragmatism and the willingness to build relationships based on trust and predictability,\" the ministry said in a statement.\"In the current situation, it is important, first and foremost, to prevent further escalation and to focus on finding a way out of the situation through dialogue.\"China&#x27;s foreign ministry said in a statement that it was \"deeply shocked\". \"China is deeply shocked and strongly condemns the use of force by the US against a sovereign country and the use of force against the president of a country,\" a ministry statement said.Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres echoed the sentiment that the US operation sets a dangerous precedent.\"The Secretary-General continues to emphasise the importance of full respect - by all - of international law, including the UN Charter,\" a spokesperson for Guterres said. \"He&#x27;s deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected.\"Pope Leo called for the \"sovereignty\" of Venezuela to be guaranteed, saying he&#x27;s following developments in the Latin American country with \"deep concern\".READ MORE: What to know about the Swiss Alpine bar fire that killed 40 The US-born pope, speaking at the Sunday Angelus, said, \"the good of the beloved Venezuelan people must prevail over every other consideration\" while calling for a journey of \"justice and peace guaranteeing the sovereignty of the country, ensuring the rule of law written in the Constitution and respecting human and civil rights of all and working together to build a peaceful future of collaboration, stability and harmony\".The pope also appealed for \"the poorest who suffer because of the difficult economic situation\" in the country whose economy is 28 per cent of what it was in 2013, according to the IMF.In early December, Leo, warned against a US military incursion in Venezuela.
