Drone sightings began shortly before 10pm Wednesday and ended just before 1am on Thursday (6am to 9am Thursday AEST).The airports in Esbjerg, Sønderborg and Skrydstrup also were impacted. Skrydstrup is an air base that is home to some of the Danish military&#x27;s fighter jets.The drones appeared to be flying around the airports with their lights turned on but authorities decided against attempting to shoot down the drones, police said. Additional details were not immediately available.The latest drone activity comes just a few days after a similar incident at Copenhagen Airport, conducted by what police call a \"capable actor\".The Copenhagen drones grounded flights in the Danish capital for hours on Monday night, prompting concerns that Russia could be behind the flyover above Scandinavia&#x27;s largest airport.It was not immediately clear whether the Copenhagen flyover was related to the incidents later in the week.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
