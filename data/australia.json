          "content": "An NBA head coach and a player are among more than 30 people charged in connection with schemes involving illegal sports betting and rigged poker games backed by the Mafia, authorities say.Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier is accused of participating in an illegal sports betting scheme using private insider NBA information, officials said on Thursday (early Friday AEDT).Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups is charged in a separate indictment alleging a wide-ranging scheme to rig underground poker games that were backed by Mafia families, authorities said.READ MORE: With this handshake, King makes history in a 500-year firstThe indictments are related to two major cases, one involving sports betting and the second involving rigged poker games, US Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr said at a news conference with FBI Director Kash Patel.Patel said the \"mind-boggling\" scale of theft, fraud and robbery involved \"tens of millions of dollars\".In the first case, six defendants are accused of participating in an insider sports betting conspiracy that exploited confidential information about NBA athletes and teams, Nocella said, calling it \"one of the most brazen sports corruption schemes since online sports betting became widely legalised in the United States\".The second case involves 31 defendants in a nationwide scheme to rig illegal poker games, Nocella said. The defendants include former professional athletes accused of using technology to steal millions of dollars from victims in underground poker games in the New York area that were backed by Mafia families, he said.Athletes accused of leaving games earlyIn the sports betting scheme, players sometimes altered their performance or took themselves out of games early, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.In one instance, Rozier, while playing for the Hornets, told others he was planning to leave the game early with a \"supposed injury\", allowing others to place wagers that raked in thousands of dollars, Tisch said.The indictment of Rozier and others says there are nine unnamed co-conspirators including a Florida resident who was an NBA player and an Oregon resident who was an NBA player from about 1997 to 2014 and an NBA coach since at least 2021, as well as a relative of Rozier.Rozier and other defendants \"had access to private information known by NBA players or NBA coaches\" that was likely to affect the outcome of games or players&#x27; performances and provided that information to other co-conspirators in exchange for either a flat fee or a share of betting profits, the indictment says.READ MORE: Tragic discovery in search for missing mumThe NBA had investigatedThe NBA, which had investigated Rozier previously, had no immediate comment.Rozier was in uniform as the Heat played the Magic in Orlando, Florida, in the season opener for both teams on Wednesday evening, though he did not play in the game.He was taken into custody in Orlando early Thursday morning. The team didn&#x27;t immediately comment on the arrest.A message was left with Rozier&#x27;s lawyer, Jim Trusty, on Thursday. Trusty previously told ESPN that Rozier was told that an initial investigation determined he did nothing wrong after he met with NBA and FBI officials in 2023, the sports network reported.A message seeking comment was left with Billups on Thursday morning.READ MORE: Iconic Aussie food company collapses owing millionsThe case was brought by the US attorney&#x27;s office in Brooklyn that previously prosecuted ex-NBA player Jontay Porter. The former Toronto Raptors centre pleaded guilty to charges that he withdrew early from games, claiming illness or injury, so that those in the know could win big by betting on him to underperform expectations.Billups was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame last year. The five-time All-Star and three-time All-NBA point guard led the Detroit Pistons to their third league title in 2004 as NBA Finals MVP.Boston drafted the former Colorado star with the No.3 pick overall in 1997. The player known as Mr Big Shot also played for Toronto, Denver, Minnesota, the New York Knicks and the Los Angeles Clippers.Billups won the Joe Dumars Trophy, the NBA&#x27;s sportsmanship award, in 2009 while playing for his hometown Denver Nuggets.The 49-year-old is in his fifth season as Portland&#x27;s coach, compiling a 117-212 record. The Trail Blazers opened the season on Wednesday night at home with a 118-114 loss to Minnesota.A game involving Rozier that has been in question was played on March 23, 2023, a matchup between the Hornets and the New Orleans Pelicans.Rozier played the first nine minutes and 36 seconds of that game — and not only did not return that night, citing a foot issue, but did not play again that season.Charlotte had eight games remaining and was not in playoff contention, so it did not seem particularly unusual that Rozier was shut down for the season&#x27;s final games.In that March 23 game, Rozier finished with five points, four rebounds and two assists in that opening period — a productive quarter but well below his usual total output for a full game.Posts still online from March 23, 2023, show that some bettors were furious with sportsbooks that evening when it became evident that Rozier was not going to return to the Charlotte-New Orleans game after the first quarter, with many turning to social media to say that something \"shady\" had gone on regarding the prop bets involving his stats for that night.A prop is a type of wager that allows gamblers to bet on whether a player will exceed a certain statistical number, such as whether the player will finish over or under a certain total of points, rebounds, assists and more.There are many different ways to get help and information about gambling.
