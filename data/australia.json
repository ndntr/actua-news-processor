WiseTech, a leading logistical software company, employs about 17,000 staff worldwide. The company has a market capitalisation of $28.5 billion.The leadership of White, who stepped down as chief executive last year but remains executive chairman, has come under scrutiny over recent months. The company has been beset with reports over complaints about inappropriate conduct regarding White&#x27;s personal life, including his relationships with female WiseTech staff members.White left the WiseTech board last year.A joint investigation by the Australian Financial Review, Sydney Morning Herald, and The Age in February found White had sold more than $200 million worth of WiseTech shares over a length of time when directors and executives were banned from selling company stock, known as a blackout period.The ASIC investigation is likely to come down to whether or not the sale of shares was made using privileged information not available to other investors. WiseTech shares dropped 17 per cent to $70.68 today following the announcement of the AFP and ASIC raid.
