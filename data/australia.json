          "content": "A Supreme Court judge has rejected an urgent legal challenge launched by the Palestinian Action Group against powers granted to NSW Police.They were hoping to march in the city this evening to rally against the state visit of Israeli President Isaac Herzog.The pro-Palestine protest was scheduled to kick off from SydneyTown Hall at 5.30pm.HAPPENING NOW: Protester moved on after yelling at Israeli president&#x27;s motorcadeBut it won&#x27;t be allowed to happen. Less than 45 minutes before the protest was due to begin, NSW Supreme Court Justice Robertson Wright announced the challenge to the declaration was dismissed.\"Submissions on both sides had ... considerable force,\" Justice Wright said.\"My conclusions have not been reached easily or lightly.Thousands of protesters will still show their opposition to Herzog despite the ruling, Palestine Action Group spokesman Josh Lees said outside court.\"We&#x27;ve lost this case, but that does not affect what we&#x27;re doing tonight,\" Lees said.\"What we&#x27;ve been saying this entire time is it&#x27;s entirely lawful for us to gather at Town Hall to hold a public assembly which is what we&#x27;ll be doing.\"Palestine Action Group is still seeking a compromise with NSW Police that would allow the activists to march from Town Hall to Parliament House, Lees saidHundreds of protesters and about 200 police had descended on Town Hall more than half an hour before the planned protest.Lawyers for the protesters told the court that the government&#x27;s declaration was too broad and did not meet legal requirements because no participants or geographic area were specified.The NSW government declared Herzog&#x27;s visit a major event and used legislation normally reserved for large crowd events, which grants police the power to restrict access to certain areas or move people along without a reason.Failure to comply with lawful police direction could result in fines of up to $5500 or exclusion from the major event area. LATEST: &#x27;Too late to leave&#x27; as Cyclone Mitchell whips up 140 km/h windsThe declaration, however, is not a ban on protests or marches , with police still aware of the demonstration planned to contest the visit of the controversial president.Before the judgement, the Palestine Action Group said that up to 5000 people would march from Town Hall to State Parliament to oppose the visit of the Israeli President.\"We are calling on police to allow our march to NSW Parliament, which they could easily do,\" the group said in a statement earlier.\"But we are not seeking any confrontation, this will be a peaceful protest.\"When asked about the opposition to his visit, Herzog said demonstrations \"undermine and delegitimise\" Israel.\"It is important for me to say that I have come here in goodwill,\" Herzog told media at Bondi Beach today.READ MORE: E-scooter rider punches tradie in road rage attackProtesters in Melbourne have also planned a \"week of action\" against the Israeli President, who is due in the Victorian capital on Thursday.Organisers are expecting as many as 10,000 activists to descend on Flinders Street Station at 5.30pm today to protest Herzog&#x27;s Australian visit. \"We are horrified, we are appalled, and we are taking our action to the streets,\" rally organiser Omar Hassan said.\"His visit as a head of state is not a political act, not a random mourner for Bondi, which we also mourn, he is a political representative of a state that has committed genocide according to the UN High Commission.\"So he is being treated as a political leader with the disrespect actually and the fury he deserves.\"The intersection of Flinders and Swanston Streets will be blocked off during the evening commute as protesters march towards the State Library of Victoria.Victoria Police has confirmed it will have a \"highly visible presence \" through the CBD to ensure the protest remains peaceful.\"Victoria Police respects the right for people to protest lawfully, however we expect that they do so peacefully without impacting the broader community,\" a spokesperson said.\"Police will be prepared to respond to any issues if needed.\"Today&#x27;s Melbourne march is expected to be followed by further protests in the coming days. - with AAP",

There&#x27;s nothing more we can do. We need the government to do something because we are out of options,\" Mr Bowles added.In a statement, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the Department of Foreign Affairs has been in regular communication with the womens&#x27; families, updating them as recently as February 5.\"I have made it clear to my Lao counterpart that Australia expects full accountability,\" Wong said.\"I have also made it clear that charges should reflect the seriousness of the tragedy which left six people dead including Holly and Bianca.\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is aware that the Vang Vieng District Court sentenced individuals over the destruction of evidence in relation to the death of a US citizen.\"\"We continue to press Lao authorities on the cases relating to Holly and Bianca&#x27;s deaths, and we will continue to support Holly and Bianca&#x27;s families at this distressing time.\"The hostel has since reopened under a different name.\"Six people died in that hotel and they just open it again? It&#x27;s beyond comprehension,\" Mr Jones said, visibly upset.But the grieving fathers conceded nothing will bring back Holly and Bianca who will be forever missed.\"We&#x27;ve got their 21st coming up this year, lots of milestones that come up, but we will continue to remember our beautiful girls,\" Mr Jones said.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
