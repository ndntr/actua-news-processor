          "content": "The US and Israel launched a major attack on targets across Iran on Saturday, and US President Donald Trump called on the Iranian people to \"take over your government\" — an extraordinary appeal that suggested the allies could be seeking to end of the country&#x27;s theocracy after decades of tensions.The first strikes of the attack appeared to target the compound home to Iran&#x27;s 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in downtown Tehran. It wasn&#x27;t immediately clear if he was there at the time. Smoke could be seen rising from the Iranian capital.LIVE UPDATES: US launches &#x27;major combat operations in Iran&#x27; \"For 47 years, the Iranian regime has chanted Death to America and waged an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder, targeting the United States, our troops and the innocent people in many, many countries,\" Trump said in a video posted on social media that sought to justify the attacks. He urged Iranians to take cover during the strikes, but then: \"When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take.\"The US president reached his decision after weeks of deliberation and an attempt by his envoys to strike a rapid diplomatic agreement that would have forced Iran to abandon long-held red lines. The US military is planning for several days of attacks, two sources told CNN.Trump never fully publicly laid out his case for war, even during his State of the Union address on Tuesday, despite strikes being a politically perilous move at home, especially for a president who campaigned on ending foreign entanglements. He noted on Saturday the potential cost to American lives.The attack quickly expanded beyond Iran. Iran&#x27;s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard said it responded by launching a \"first wave\" of drones and missiles targeting Israel, where a nationwide warning was issued as the military said it bring down Iranian fire.Meanwhile, Bahrain said that a missile attack targeted the US Navy&#x27;s 5th Fleet headquarters in the island kingdom. Witnesses heard sirens and explosions in Kuwait, home to US Army Central. Explosions could be also be heard in Qatar.Iraq and the United Arab Emirates closed their airspace, and sirens sounded in Jordan.The Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, meanwhile, vowed to resume attacks on Red Sea shipping routes and on Israel, according to two senior Houthi officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because there was no official announcement from the Houthi leadership.Iran&#x27;s Foreign Ministry issued a defiant statement, saying that the country \"will not hesitate\" in its response. In a statement posted on X, the ministry said: \"The time has come to defend the homeland and confront the enemy&#x27;s military assault.\"&#x27;Major combat operations&#x27;Tensions have soared in recent weeks as American warships moved into the region, and Trump said he wanted a deal to constrain Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. He saw an opportunity while the country is struggling at home with growing dissent following nationwide protests.On Saturday, Trump said in the video that the US had begun \"major combat operations in Iran.\" Trump claimed that Iran has continued to develop its nuclear program and plans to develop missiles to reach US. He acknowledged that there could be American casualties following Iran strikes, saying \"that often happens in war.\"But Trump&#x27;s statement indicated the US was striking for reasons far beyond the nuclear program, listing grievances stretching back to the beginning of the Islamic Republic following a revolution in 1979 that turned Iran from one of America&#x27;s closest allies in the Middle East into a fierce foe.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel — which considers Iran its archenemy — said the joint attack was to \"remove an existential threat posed\" by Iran.\"Our joint operation will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their fate into their own hands,\" Netanyahu said.Targets in the Israeli campaign included Iran&#x27;s military, symbols of government and intelligence targets, according to an official briefed on the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss non-public information on the attack.Iran had hoped to avert a war, but maintains it has the right to enrich uranium and does not want to discuss other issues, like its long-range missile program or support for armed groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.Iran has said it hasn&#x27;t enriched since June, but it has blocked international inspectors from visiting the sites America bombed during a 12-day war then. Satellite photos analysed by The Associated Press have shown new activity at two of those sites, suggesting Iran is trying to assess and potentially recover material there.Iran currently has a self-imposed limit on its ballistic missile program, limiting their range to 2,000 kilometres. That puts all the Mideast and some of Eastern Europe in their range. There is no public evidence of Iran seeking to have intercontinental ballistic missiles, though Washington has criticized its space program as potentially allowing it to one day.Iran retaliatesHours after the strikes, Iran&#x27;s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard said it launched a \"first wave\" of drones and missiles targeting Israel. It had vowed to respond if attacked, including saying American military personnel and bases spread across the region would be targets.Explosions rocked Israel as the country worked to intercept incoming Iranian missiles. There was no immediate word on any damage or casualties from the ongoing attack.Several hospitals in Israel launched their emergency protocols, including moving patients and surgeries to underground facilities.US embassies or consulates in Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Israel posted on social media that they told staffers to shelter in place and recommended all Americans \"do the same until further notice.\"Strikes hit targets across IranIranian media reported strikes nationwide. Roads to Khamenei&#x27;s compound in downtown Tehran had been shut down by authorities as other blasts rang out across the capital.In Tehran, witnesses heard the first blast by Khamenei&#x27;s office. Iranian state television later reported on the explosion, without offering a cause.More explosions struck Iran&#x27;s capital after Israel said it was attacking the country. Authorities have offered no casualty information from the strikes.Australia quick to react, issues urgent warnings Anthony Albanese issued a statement of support to the US in their strikes, labelling the Iranian regime \"a destabilising force\".\"We support the United States acting to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and to prevent Iran continuing to threaten international peace and security,\" the prime minister said.\"Iran directed at least two attacks on Australian soil in 2024. These appalling acts targeting Australia&#x27;s Jewish community were intended to create fear, divide our society and challenge our sovereignty.\"Albanese pointed out, in addition to sanctioning 200-Iranian linked individuals, Australia \"took the unprecedented steps of expelling Iran&#x27;s Ambassador\".Any Australians who are in Iran have been urged to leave the country, as the government issued a swift statement after news of the attacks broke on Saturday evening. \"There is a risk of reprisal attacks and further escalation across the region,\" it said in an updated travel advisory.\"Closure of airspace around transit hubs may impact flights globally, causing delays and cancellations.\"It also warned the Australian Embassy in Tehran had suspended its operations, meaning the ability for it to offer support for stranded Australians is \"extremely limited\". The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) also urged those in Israel and Lebanon to consider their future plans, advising \"the security situation could deteriorate rapidly throughout Israel with little or no notice\".\" The Australian Government has directed the departure of all dependants of Australian officials posted to Israel in response to the deteriorating security situation in the Middle East,\" they said.- Reported with Associated Press and CNN.

          "content": "US President Donald Trump has claimed Iranian&#x27;s could \"face death\" after the United States and Israel launched strikes against Iran on Saturday.In an eight-minute speech posted to his social media pages, Trump outlined his motivations to stop a group of \"very hard, terrible people.\"Watch Trump&#x27;s speech in full in the video above.LIVE UPDATES: US launches &#x27;major combat operations in Iran&#x27;READ TRUMP&#x27;S STATEMENT IN FULLA short time ago, the United States military began major combat operations in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime. A vicious group of very hard, terrible people. Its menacing activities directly endanger the United States, our troops, our bases overseas, and our allies throughout the world.For 47 years, the Iranian regime has chanted Death to America and waged an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder, targeting the United States, our troops and the innocent people in many, many countries. Among the regime&#x27;s very first acts was to back a violent takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, holding dozens of American hostages for 444 days. In 1983, Iran&#x27;s proxies carried out the marine barracks bombing in Beirut that killed 241 American military personnel.In 2000, they knew and were probably involved with the attack on the USS Cole. Many died. Iranian forces killed and maimed hundreds of American service members in Iraq. The regime&#x27;s proxies have continued to launch countless attacks against American forces stationed in the Middle East in recent years, as well as U.S. naval and commercial vessels and international shipping lines. It&#x27;s been mass terror, and we&#x27;re not going to put up with it any longer.From Lebanon to Yemen and Syria to Iraq, the regime has armed, trained and funded terrorist militias that have soaked the earth with blood and guts. And it was Iran&#x27;s proxy, Hamas, that launched the monstrous Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, slaughtering more than 1,000 innocent people, including 46 Americans, while taking 12 of our citizens hostage. It was brutal, something like the world has never seen before.Iran is the world&#x27;s number one state sponsor of terror, and just recently killed tens of thousands of its own citizens on the street as they protested. It has always been the policy of the United States, in particular my administration, that this terrorist regime can never have a nuclear weapon. I&#x27;ll say it again, they can never have a nuclear weapon. That is why in Operation Midnight Hammer last June, we obliterated the regime&#x27;s nuclear program at Fort Doe, Natanz and Isfahan. After that attack, we warned them never to resume their malicious pursuit of nuclear weapons, and we sought repeatedly to make a deal. We tried. They wanted to do it. They didn&#x27;t want to do it. Again they wanted to do it. They didn&#x27;t want to do it. They didn&#x27;t know what was happening. They just wanted to practice evil. But Iran refused, just as it has for decades and decades.They&#x27;ve rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can&#x27;t take it anymore. Instead, they attempted to rebuild their nuclear program and to continue developing the long range missiles that can now threaten our very good friends and allies in Europe, our troops stationed overseas, and could soon reach the American homeland. Just imagine how emboldened this regime would be if they ever had, and actually were armed with nuclear weapons as a means to deliver their message.For these reasons, the United States military is undertaking a massive and ongoing operation to prevent this very wicked, radical dictatorship from threatening America and our core national security interests. We&#x27;re going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally again obliterated. We&#x27;re going to annihilate their navy. We&#x27;re going to ensure that the region&#x27;s terrorist proxies can no longer destabilize the region or the world and attack our forces, and no longer use their IEDs, or roadside bombs as they are sometimes called, to so gravely wound and kill thousands and thousands of people, including many Americans. And we will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. It&#x27;s a very simple message. They will never have a nuclear weapon.This regime will soon learn that no one should challenge the strength and might of the United States Armed Forces. I built and rebuilt our military in my first administration and there is no military on earth even close to its power, strength or sophistication. My administration is taking every possible step to minimize the risk to U.S. personnel in the region. Even so, and I do not make this statement lightly, the Iranian regime seeks to kill. The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost, and we may have casualties. That often happens in war. But we&#x27;re doing this not for now. We&#x27;re doing this for the future. And it is a noble mission. We pray for every service member as they selflessly risk their lives to ensure that Americans and our children will never be threatened by a nuclear-armed Iran. We ask God to protect all of our heroes in harm&#x27;s way. And we trust that with his help, the men and women of the armed forces will prevail. We have the greatest in the world, and they will prevail.To the members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, the armed forces and all of the police, I say tonight that you must lay down your weapons and have complete immunity. Or in the alternative, face certain death. So, lay down your arms. You will be treated fairly with total immunity, or you will face certain death. Finally, to the great proud people of Iran, I say tonight that the hour of your freedom is at hand. Stay sheltered. Don&#x27;t leave your home. It&#x27;s very dangerous outside. Bombs will be dropping everywhere. When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.For many years, you have asked for America&#x27;s help. But you never got it. No president was willing to do what I am willing to do tonight. Now you have a president who is giving you what you want. So let&#x27;s see how you respond. America is backing you with overwhelming strength and devastating force. Now is the time to seize control of your destiny, and to unleash the prosperous and glorious future that is close within your reach. This is the moment for action. Do not let it pass.May God bless the brave men and women of America&#x27;s armed forces. May God bless the United States of America. May God bless you all. Thank you.

A regime that relies on the repression and murder of its own people to retain power is without legitimacy,\" he said.Referencing two attacks on Jewish synagogues in Australia in 2024, Albanese said: \" These appalling acts targeting Australia&#x27;s Jewish community were intended to create fear, divide our society and challenge our sovereignty.\"EXPLAINED: Trump went from &#x27;not happy&#x27; to bombing Iran in hours - here&#x27;s whyAs a result of the attacks, Australia expelled Iran&#x27;s ambassador and listed the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation.Albanese said Iran has been a \"destabilising force\" through its ballistic missile and nuclear program.WATCH: Trump tells Iranian officials to lay down arms or &#x27;face death&#x27;He said it was a \"threat to world peace\". \"The international community has been clear that the Iranian regime can never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon,\" Albanese added.\"Australia stands with the brave people of Iran in their struggle against oppression.\"Opposition leader Angus Taylor called Iran&#x27;s regime \"authoritarian, antisemitic and abhorrent.\"\"It wants nuclear weapons, seeks the destruction of Israel, has encouraged terrorism through its proxies - Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis - and has supplied weapons to Russia to support Putin&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine,\" he said in a post on X.\"We pray for the Iranian people at this time.\"NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
