          "content": "A ngus Taylor has emerged victorious as the new Liberal leader after snatching the job from Sussan Ley in a decisive partyroom vote – but his name may not be so familiar with many Australian voters who watched the spill unfold.The dust from the opposition&#x27;s crushing 2025 federal election defeat is still settling as Taylor becomes the third leader of the party – following Peter Dutton and Ley – in the past nine months.The Hume MP and new opposition leader brings with him a glossy resume and widespread support from the shadow cabinet as he sits behind Ley&#x27;s freshly vacated desk in Canberra.READ MORE: &#x27;Ticking time bomb&#x27; sitting under new Opposition Leader Angus Taylor&#x27;s deskTaylor – who was elected to parliament in 2013 – has considerably less political experience than his predecessor Ley, but his CV does bear an impressive list of accolades.To start the father-of-four is a Rhodes Scholar, a prestigious postgraduate study undertaken at the University of Oxford in England.Taylor is among a handful of Rhodes Scholar-cum-politicians in Australia – including former prime ministers Bob Hawke, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull.He completed a Master of Economics at Oxford University while studying in the UK.After graduating, Taylor worked as a management consultant in the 1990s at top firm McKinsey and Co and later at Port Jackson partners.It was this career path that placed him in the company of former Liberal prime minister John Howard, who championed him for a run in politics alongside the then-PM Tony Abbott.Taylor&#x27;s Rhodes scholarship and shiny CV have already been a major talking point in the wake of his spill victory.The erudite honour may well become an albatross on Taylor&#x27;s back as he faces immediate questions about his ability to lead the Liberals.READ MORE: Slain man&#x27;s head cut off &#x27;to fit in car&#x27;, court toldTurnbull – himself a victim of the Liberal leadership merry-go-round – said Taylor&#x27;s qualifications don&#x27;t mean he automatically passes muster.\"What they are saying is this guy has all of these degrees and all of these qualifications and he is a Rhodes scholar… the bottom line is he has not delivered the thought of positive policy agendas, real achievements in government that you would expect from somebody those qualifications,\" he told the ABC.Nine&#x27;s political editor Charles Croucher said Taylor&#x27;s resume certainly carries some weight as he attempts to right the Liberal ship.\"If you were to type in an ideal Liberal Party leader into ChatGPT or something like that, the resume they would spit out would look like Angus Taylor&#x27;s,\" he said.\"He&#x27;s from a well-known family in NSW, went to a private school, got a Rhodes scholarship, worked at some of the best firms, and went into politics and has held all the important roles on the way up.\"Taylor hails from a multi-generational farming family in southern NSW, with his grandfather William Hudson long regarded as the father of the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme.READ MORE: Mystery gloves found in search for Nancy GuthrieTaylor&#x27;s 13-year rise up the political ladderAfter moving his family to Goulburn in 2011 to contest the seat of Hume and officially entering parliament in 2013, Taylor has steadily risen up the political ladder.He was appointed minister for law enforcement and cybersecurity, before becoming minister for energy under Scott Morrison.He moved to the opposition bench and became shadow treasurer under Peter Dutton following the Coalition&#x27;s 2022 election defeat.Taylor was the shadow minister for defence under Ley until he resigned earlier this week. Taylor has been characterised during his career as someone who fights for conservative Liberal values, including championing the free market and the traditional family unit.Frontbencher James Paterson – who resigned in solidarity with Taylor this week – has described him as \"the smartest policy brain in the shadow cabinet\".During his first speech as Liberal leader, Taylor flagged a hardline stance on immigration and taxes.He said the standards for migrants entering Australia have been \"too low\", before telling voters it was a \"mistake\" not to offer tax cuts last election.\"We need to be the party of lower taxes, including lower personal income taxes,\" he said.Social media faux pas One of the lingering legacies of Taylor&#x27;s political career so far is, of course, his social media blunder during the 2019 federal election.The then-energy minister was caught red-handed congratulating himself on his own social media post about adding 1000 extra carparks in his electorate.\"Fantastic. Great move. Well done Angus,\" he wrote in a Facebook comment, posted from his own Angus Taylor MP profile.The seven-year-old gaffe has come back to haunt Taylor following the leadership spill.Taylor&#x27;s latest posts on Facebook, Instagram and X have been flooded with the same comment.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

LIVE UPDATES: Liberal leadership spill Footage shared widely online from the demonstrations showed officers interrupting a group praying as well as force being used to subdue the crowd. NSW Premier Chris Minns insisted it was \"proportionate\". \"I am not going to throw the police under a bus,\" Minns said.A video of officers moving on a group of muslim men in prayer attracted much outrage. Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said the move-on direction was not targeting any religion and \"apologised for any offence taken for interfering with that religious process\".The investigation will examine the lawfulness and appropriateness of the actions of NSW Police and individual officers.The LECC is the independent and specialist oversight body for the NSW Police Force.At the conclusion of the investigation, the LECC will release a public report to the NSW Parliament.

          "content": "An American man who spent a year discussing extreme conspiracies with a family behind the Wieambilla shootings has been sentenced to three years&#x27; imprisonment.Donald Day, 58, was arrested in the United States after a year-long investigation into his contact with Gareth, Nathaniel and Stacey Train before the trio killed two police officers and a neighbour at their rural Queensland property.Day faced the US Federal Court in Arizona on Friday AEST after making a deal with prosecutors in October 2025 to plead guilty to a charge of possessing firearms as a convicted felon.READ MORE: Angus Taylor emerges victorious from Liberal leadership spillHis prior charges of threatening World Health Organisation figures and FBI agents as well as possessing an illegal shotgun were dropped.Day used the name \"Geronimo&#x27;s Bones\" to exchange comments and videos on YouTube with the Trains between May 2021 to December 2022, US District Judge John Tuchi heard.Brothers Nathaniel, 46, and Gareth, 47, used high-powered rifles during an ambush to kill Constables Matthew Arnold, 26, and Rachel McCrow, 29, at Wieambilla in December 2022.READ MORE: FBI issues new details of suspect in Nancy Guthrie case Gareth Train&#x27;s wife Stacey, 45, and the brothers fatally shot neighbour Alan Dare, 58, soon afterwards.Day was mentioned in the last video the Trains ever made, filmed before they were killed in a shootout with tactical officers hours after the Wieambilla ambush.\"They came to us, and we killed them,\" Gareth and Stacey Train said in the video.\"We&#x27;ll see you when we go home. We&#x27;ll see you at home, Don. Love you.\"READ MORE: Men seen fleeing into bush after police bust $10 million cannabis crop Day responded to the video saying: \"those bastards will regret that they ever f***ed with us\".Queensland Police officers had been due to testify at Day&#x27;s now aborted trial about the alleged serious danger the American&#x27;s threats posed due to his association with the Trains.Day had prepared a sniper&#x27;s nest for a confrontation with police and told the Trains to do the same with \"determination and fury\", saying he looked forward to \"taking the scalps of our enemies\".Day encountered the Train family through public comments and videos posted around a \"similar, distrustful view of society\".A Queensland inquest in November 2025 found the Trains were delusional and believed \"war had reached their gates\" in the form of a battle to the death with Satanic entities disguised as police.\"It was the Trains&#x27; shared psychotic disorders, not their communications with Mr Day, that explained their actions,\" Day&#x27;s lawyer, Jon Sands, told the US court.Mr Sands called for his client to be sentenced to two years and three months with 12 months of supervised release.Prosecutor Timothy Courchaine asked for a sentence of three years and 10 months with three years&#x27; supervised release.Day was sentenced to 36 months&#x27; imprisonment minus time already served.He had spent two years and three months in custody since his December 2023 arrest by the FBI in Arizona.Day will be on supervised release for three years after serving at least 90 per cent of his term.He was also ordered to forfeit his firearms and ammunition, including military-style rifles, shotguns and handguns.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
