There needs to be more informed support for the victims ... this isn&#x27;t a once-off, it is still happening.\"The class action has been filed by Australian law firm JGA Saddler, backed by global litigation funder Omni Bridgeway.The legal case is a demand for action, accountability and real change as sexual violence and discrimination continue to plague female ADF members, JGA Saddler lawyer Josh Aylward said.\"The threat of war often isn&#x27;t the biggest safety fear for female ADF personnel, it is the threat of sexual violence in their workplace,\" he said.\"They have signed up to defend their country, not to fight off fellow ADF personnel on a daily basis, all while simply trying to do their job.\"Aylward noted these were not historical cases, and some incidents had occurred within the last 12 months.READ MORE: &#x27;Kill crew&#x27; trio charged with murdering alleged drug syndicate member&#x27;s wife\"The ADF has done very little to protect those who protect us,\" he said.In a statement, a Defence spokesperson said the ADF was developing a comprehensive sexual misconduct prevention strategy.\"Defence acknowledges there is work to be done and that is why the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, which relate to sexual violence, are being implemented as a priority,\" the spokesperson said.\"All Defence personnel have a right to be respected and deserve to have a positive workplace experience in the ADF.\"There is no place for sexual violence or misconduct in Defence.\"Defence Minister Richard Marles was contacted for comment.Support is available from the National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service at 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732).DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

An alleged \"kill crew\" charged with the kidnap and murder of an organised crime network member&#x27;s wife in Sydney sent a picture of the woman to her husband before killing her, police claim.Thi Kim Tran, 45, was at her home in Bankstown about 10.30pm on April 17 when a group of men allegedly forced their way in and kidnapped her at gunpoint.They allegedly assaulted an eight-year-old boy with a baseball bat, putting him in a coma, before forcing the woman to strip naked on the street and forcing her into an SUV.READ MORE: &#x27;Mind boggling&#x27;: NBA coach and player charged over massive betting schemesA 15-year-old boy at the home was also taken to hospital for assessment.About an hour later, a car was found burning on Welfare Avenue in nearby Beverly Hills.Fire crews extinguished the blaze, but the car was destroyed and police found Tran dead inside.She had been bound and gagged, but had died before the car was set alight, Detective Superintendent Joe Doueihi told media today. READ MORE: Tragic discovery in search for missing mumPolice allege the woman was likely targeted due to her husband&#x27;s involvement with a Victoria-based organised criminal network.Strike Force Bushfield detectives yesterday arrested three men, aged 31, 20 and 21, allegedly part of a \"kill crew\" tasked with finding and killing Tran&#x27;s husband.They were charged with murder, conspiring to murder, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, kidnapping in company and participating in a criminal group.Doueihi said the matter would be heard in court today.Families no longer &#x27;off limits&#x27; Doueihi said the husband was in hiding after his superiors in the crime syndicate suspected he had stolen up to 80kg of drugs from their operation.Attempts to lure him out failed, Doueihi said, and so they had visited his home after attempting to contact him.However, Doueihi said police will allege Tran would have been targeted regardless.\"It obviously appears those days are gone,\" he said when asked by media about whether old underworld prohibitions against targeting uninvolved family remembers had been discarded.\"These young criminals are ruthless, they don&#x27;t care about the &#x27;code&#x27;, if I can use that word.\"It&#x27;s no longer &#x27;families are off limits&#x27;, it&#x27;s whatever&#x27;s in their best interest. \"He claimed the alleged killers also sent Tran&#x27;s husband a photo of her before her death.Tran was unaware of any supposed criminal activity her husband had been involved in, Doueihi said, and police were now in contact with the husband, who was cooperating with the investigation. READ MORE: With this handshake, King makes history in a 500-year first&#x27;Guns for hire&#x27;Doueihi said the kill order had come from much higher up in the crime syndicate, but it was uncertain whether it originated in Victoria or overseas.He characterised the three men arrested yesterday as \"guns for hire\" who were \"extremely well known\" to police and organised crime groups alike. And the investigation is still ongoing.\"There may have been other people at the house, but we&#x27;re not quite certain,\" Doueihi said.The Anh Nguyen, 29, was charged in August with facilitating the alleged kidnapping and murder.Nguyen is not alleged to have killed Tran himself, but to have brought the three men who allegedly did to her home and facilitated it.The eight-year-old injured with the bat had made a \"remarkable\" physical recovery, Doueihi said, after it was initially feared he would be left with life-long injuries.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
