Investigators think it may have been an inside job Thieves took less than eight minutes to steal jewels valued at €88 million euros ($157 million) in a weekend heist at the world&#x27;s most visited museum — a crime that has shocked the world.French officials described how the intruders used a basket lift to scale the Louvre&#x27;s façade, forced open a window, smashed display cases and fled last Sunday morning.

Trump negotiated the deal in his first term, but has since soured on it.Trump and Carney will both attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia. But Trump told reporters traveling with him that he had no intention of meeting Carney there.Trump said the ad misrepresented the position of Reagan, a two-term president and a beloved figure in the Republican Party. But Reagan was wary of tariffs and used much of the 1987 address featured in Ontario&#x27;s ad spelling out the case against tariffs.Trump has complained the ad was aimed at influencing the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of arguments scheduled for next month that could decide whether Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs, a key part of his economic strategy.Lower courts had ruled he had exceeded his authority.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
