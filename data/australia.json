Earlier, Albanese joined the British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in discussing defence, security, trade and the economy.Top of the agenda was how to protect the AUKUS pact from being unpicked by Donald Trump&#x27;s America First agenda.The US President&#x27;s unique brand of populism has been matched in Britain by Nigel Farage&#x27;s Reform party which is leading the UK polls.Farage is riding a wave of anti-immigration sentiment helped along by rallies stoked by far-right activists.March for Australia protests have also been held in major cities over the past few weeks. \"That sends shivers through the spines on many of our communities,\" Starmer said.\"I don&#x27;t want to see the rise of populist organisations,\" Albanese added.READ MORE: Trump says he&#x27;s sending troops to Portland to protect ICE facilitiesThe British Prime Minister hosted his Australian counterpart at Number 10.Albanese said: \"We share values and today more so than ever really.\"Later, he was seen heading into the famous door with some Aussie-brewed beers with partner Haydon.He clutched a four-pack of his own Albo brew by Willie The Boatman in Sydney.READ MORE: Man dies after plane owned by skydiving business crashesAlbanese and Starmer are both from the progressive side of politics.Albanese scored a thumping re-election in May.The other is facing an early reckoning just 14 months after winning power.The British public is increasingly concerned about illegal migrants, with many crossing the English Channel in boats.The British PM has announced a mandatory digital ID in a bid to stamp out illegal workers.Albanese declined to say whether he recommended Sir Keir learn the lesson of the Australian Labor Party and muscle up in border control.",

I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary,\" Trump wrote in a social media post.The White House did not provide additional comment when reached by CNN for clarification on what the president meant by \"full force\" and which troops would be sent to the city.READ MORE: Albanese joins UK PM in far right warnings as he takes Aussie beers to No.10It&#x27;s the latest example of Trump&#x27;s willingness to use the military in extraordinary ways as part of his push to reduce crime in American cities.He deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles in June and to Washington, DC, last month.He has also threatened to send troops to several other Democratic-led cities, such as Baltimore and Chicago.Shortly after the president&#x27;s post, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said on Fox News the Trump administration is investigating the \"highly organised\" nature of protests in certain American cities, claiming that some are being paid and funded.There is no evidence of McLaughlin&#x27;s claims.\"Whether it be in Portland, whether it be in Chicago or otherwise, we will bring the resources we need to make sure that Americans are safe,\" she added.State and local leaders, including US Senator Jeff Merkley, Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, US Representative Maxine Dexter and City Council members, urged the community to stay peaceful at a news conference on Friday night, according to CNN affiliate KPTV, after the city saw an increase in activity by federal agents.\"Here is what I do know – the president has sent agents here to create chaos and riots here in Portland, to induce a reaction. To induce protests. To induce conflicts. His goal is to make Portland look as he was describing it as,\" Merkley said.\"Our job is to say, &#x27;We are not going to take the bait.&#x27;\"Wilson in a statement Saturday said there is no need to send troops, adding the president \"will not find lawlessness or violence here unless he plans to perpetrate it.\"\"Imagine if the federal government sent hundreds of engineers, or teachers, or outreach workers to Portland, instead of a short, expensive, and fruitless show of force,\" the mayor wrote.Oregon Governor Tina Kotek wrote on social media Saturday her office had not been notified why the troops were being deployed.\"My office is reaching out to the White House and Homeland Security for more information. We have been provided no information on the reason or purpose of any military mission,\" Kotek wrote.\"There is no national security threat in Portland. Our communities are safe and calm.\"READ MORE: UK store Harrods warns customers personal details taken in data breach Trump&#x27;s announcement comes after a shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas by a gunman who investigators believe intended to target ICE personnel and property.He killed one detainee and seriously injured two others.An ICE facility about two miles (3.2 kilometres) south of downtown Portland has been at the centre of almost constant protests throughout the summer.Most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, but some have ended in the deployment of tear gas and resulted in the facility being closed for several days over the summer.Trump forecast action in Portland on Thursday, repeating the claim to reporters that protesters are being paid \"a lot of money\" to generate chaos.\"We&#x27;re going to get out there, and we&#x27;re gonna do a pretty big number on those people in Portland that are doing that. They&#x27;re professional agitators and anarchists,\" Trump said.Trump earlier this month designated Antifa – the loose factions of black-clad leftists or anarchists who show up at protests opposing the police or government – as a \"major terrorist organization.\"The White House has emphasised incidents in Portland, home to one of the oldest organizations in the country to carry the Antifa moniker, in its statements about the designation.Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officials were deployed to downtown Portland in 2020, during Trump&#x27;s first term, due to protests after the murder of George Floyd.\"I&#x27;m going to look at it now, because I didn&#x27;t know that was still going on. This has been going on for years,\" Trump said earlier this month.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
