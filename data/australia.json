Sussan deserves to lead unencumbered by interventions from shadow cabinet colleagues.\" But Ley said it came down to a long-standing cabinet tradition and said in a statement that she \"made clear that every shadow cabinet member was bound by solidarity\".Yesterday, Hastie \"informed\" her \"he would be unable to comply\", adding \"Mr Hastie did not raise any matters relating to policy on this call\".Today, acting shadow home affairs minister James Paterson said he hoped Hastie would make a return.\"I would certainly prefer that we still had both Andrew Hastie and Jacinta Price on the frontbench and it is my hope that in due course both of them can return,\" Paterson said.Hastie is the latest in a growing group of former frontbenchers doing their bidding from the back.This includes Liberal Senators Jane Hume, Sarah Henderson, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and MP Tony Pasin, alongside Nationals Colleagues Matt Canavan, Michael McCormack and former deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce.\"We&#x27;re such a small and depleted team after the last election,\" Hume said.\"Everybody, whether they be frontbench or backbench, has to stump up and pull their weight.\"Hastie&#x27;s decision has fuelled more Liberal leadership speculation.His conservative colleague, Senator Price, was demoted less than a month ago after refusing to back Ley.As the divide deepens over which direction the party&#x27;s policies should take, Nationals leader Daid Littleproud says he hopes they get back on track quickly.\"They&#x27;re going on a period of self-discovery and we hope that they can work it out and get on with the job,\" he said.Hume told Today this morning this loss of Hastie from the frontbench \"is a huge blow\", coming less than five months since he was appointed Shadow Minister for Home Affairs on May 28.\"Andrew is a man of enormous talent and great integrity, but to be honest, we&#x27;re such a small and depleted team after the last election.\"Everybody has to step up and pull their weight,\" she added. Hume was asked if Hastie&#x27;s departure undermines Ley&#x27;s leadership .\"He said that he does not think that he cannot deliver on those expectations, so in order not to destabilise, he has withdrawn himself from the front bench,\" she replied.READ MORE: Hamas says it accepts some elements of Gaza peace plan after Trump issues ultimatumWhen asked if she is happy with the job that Ley is doing as opposition leader, she stated that Ley \"has got the most difficult job in politics\" and she has \"the support of the party room.\"Littleproud said as Coalition partners, he wants the Liberals to be strong. \"It&#x27;s disappointing. Andrew&#x27;s made a decision to leave the frontbench. He has a lot to offer, but obviously,\" Littleproud told Today.\"There&#x27;s a disagreement between himself and Sussan.\"When asked if he had confidence in Ley&#x27;s leadership, he did not give a direct answer.\"My job is to respect the leadership of who the Liberal Party puts up,\" he said.\"I&#x27;m not part of that party room. \" DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
