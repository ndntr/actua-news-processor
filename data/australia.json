          "standfirst": "A federal appeals court ruled that Donald Trump&#x27;s tariffs are an illegal use of power, but has left them in place",
          "content": "A US federal appeals court has ruled that Donald Trump had no legal right to impose sweeping tariffs on almost every country on earth, but left in place for now his effort to build a protectionist wall around the American economy.The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Trump wasn&#x27;t legally allowed to declare national emergencies and impose import taxes on almost every nation, a ruling that largely upheld a May decision by a specialised federal trade court in New York.\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the judges wrote in a 7-4 ruling.But they did not strike down the tariffs immediately, allowing his administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.The US president vowed to do just that. \"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform.White House spokesman Kush Desai said Trump had acted lawfully, and \"we look forward to ultimate victory on this matter.\"An attorney for small businesses affected by the tariffs, on the other hand, said the ruling shows Trump doesn&#x27;t have unlimited power to impose tariffs on his own.\"This decision protects American businesses and consumers from the uncertainty and harm caused by these unlawful tariffs,\" said Jeffrey Schwab, director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Centre.Putting pressure on alliesThe ruling complicates Trump&#x27;s ambitions to upend decades of American trade policy completely on his own.Trump has alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act.His tariffs — and the erratic way he&#x27;s rolled them out — have shaken global markets, alienated US trading partners and allies and raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth.But he&#x27;s also used the levies to pressure the European Union, Japan and other countries into accepting one-sided trade deals and to bring tens of billions of dollars into the federal Treasury to help pay for the massive tax cuts he signed into law July 4.\"While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments, or even seek to renegotiate terms,\" Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.The government has argued that if the tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it&#x27;s collected, delivering a financial blow to the US Treasury.\"It would be 1929 all over again, a GREAT DEPRESSION!\" Trump said in a previous post on Truth Social.A dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday&#x27;s ruling clears a possible legal path for Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions \"is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court&#x27;s decisions,\" which have allowed the legislature to grant some tariffing authorities to the US president.Revenue from tariffs now totals $159 billion, more than double what it was at the same point the year before.Indeed, the Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean \"financial ruin\" for the United States.What tariffs are in questionThe ruling involves two sets of import taxes, both of which Trump justified by declaring a national emergency under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA):—The sweeping tariffs he announced April 2 — \"Liberation Day,&#x27;&#x27; he called it — when he imposed \"reciprocal&#x27;&#x27; tariffs of up to 50 per cent on countries with which the United States runs trade deficits and a \"baseline&#x27;&#x27; 10 per cent tariff on just about everyone else. Those tariff rates have since been revised by Trump, in some cases after trade negotiations, and generally went into effect August 7.The national emergency underlying the tariffs, Trump said, was the long-running gap between what the US sells and what it buys from the rest of the world.The US president started to levy modified the tariff rates in August, but goods from countries with which the US runs a surplus also face the taxes.The \"trafficking tariffs&#x27;&#x27; he announced on February 1 on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, and later refined.These were designed to get those countries to do more to stop what he declared a national emergency: the illegal flow of drugs and immigrants across their borders into the United States.The Constitution gives Congress the power to impose taxes, including tariffs. But over decades, lawmakers have ceded authorities to the president, and Trump has made the most of the power vacuum.But Trump&#x27;s assertion that IEEPA essentially gives him unlimited power to tax imports quickly drew legal challenges at least seven cases.No president had ever used the law to justify tariffs, though IEEPA had been used frequently to impose export restrictions and other sanctions on US adversaries such as Iran and North Korea.The plaintiffs argued that the emergency power law does not authorise the use of tariffs.They also noted that the trade deficit hardly meets the definition of an \"unusual and extraordinary&#x27;&#x27; threat that would justify declaring an emergency under the law.The United States, after all, has run trade deficits in which it buys more from foreign countries than it sells them for 49 straight years, and in good times and bad.Emergency powersThe Trump administration argued that courts approved former US President Richard Nixon&#x27;s emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic crisis that arose from the chaos that followed his decision to end a policy linking the US dollar to the price of gold.The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language used in IEEPA.In May, the US Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump&#x27;s Liberation Day tariffs \"exceed any authority granted to the President&#x27;&#x27; under the emergency powers law.In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges, one by five businesses and one by 12 US states, into a single case.In the case of the drug trafficking and immigration tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico, the trade court ruled that the levies did not meet IEEPA&#x27;s requirement that they \"deal with&#x27;&#x27; the problem they were supposed to address.The court challenge does not cover other Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminium, and autos that the US president imposed after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to US national security.Nor does it include tariffs that Trump imposed on China in his first term, and Former US president Joe Biden kept, after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the United States and other Western countries.Trump could potentially cite alternative authorities to impose import taxes, though they are more limited.Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, for instance, allows the US president to tax imports from countries with which the US runs big trade deficits at 15 per cent for 150 days.Likewise, Section 301 of the same 1974 law allows the US president to tax imports from countries found to have engaged in unfair trade practices after an investigation by the Office of the US Trade Representative. Trump used Section 301 authority to launch his first-term trade war with China.",

The move delayed the Russian advance and protected the Ukrainian capital.In the case of the two bridges in Russia, the Ukrainian military found out about the stashes of mines and used it to its own advantage.Ukraine&#x27;s 58th Separate Motorised Infantry Brigade, which conducted the operation, told CNN that they decided have a closer look at the bridge after noticing unusual activity around it.\"It became clear that something was going on there.READ MORE: Police trying to get into mind of accused cop killer as manhunt continuesWe couldn&#x27;t fly a regular reconnaissance drone under the bridge because the signal would simply disappear, so we flew in with a first-person-view drone equipped with fibre optics,\" a representative of the brigade told CNN.A video filmed by the drone shows it approaching the bridge and discovering a large pile of anti-tank mines and other ammunition. A piece of fabric that appears to have been covering the stash is seen lying to the side.\"We saw the mines, and we struck,\" they added.The video ends abruptly when the drone hits the stash. Footage filmed by a second camera from some distance shows a large explosion.CNN has geolocated the bridge seen in the video to the Belgorod region in southern Russia, near the border with Ukraine.READ MORE: One person killed, another seriously injured after separate freak incidents in Queensland\"After that, we decided to check the other bridge. We found it was also mined and we struck,\" the brigade representative said, adding: \"(We) saw an opportunity and took it.\"The bridges&#x27; destruction – and the daring way Ukraine achieved it – is a rare piece of good news for Kyiv.Ukraine is facing a tough situation along the frontlines as Russian troops continue to inch forward as Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to delay any ceasefire talks.At the same time, Moscow keeps terrorising Ukraine&#x27;s civilian population with near-daily deadly aerial attacks against cities across the country.Russia did not comment on the attacks against the bridges.Cheap drones prove their valueThe drones used in the attack costs between 25,000 and 30,000 Ukrainian hryvnas, or between $600 to $725, the brigade representative told CNN.That makes the two attacks extremely cost-effective.Taking down a bridge from afar is not an easy undertaking. Under normal circumstances, it would require expensive guided munitions delivered by a sophisticated system such as a missile launcher or plane.READ MORE: Trump&#x27;s tariffs &#x27;illegal use of emergency power&#x27;Ukraine has previously said it used the Western-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) to blow up bridges in Russia&#x27;s Kursk region.These are pricey weapons – when Germany purchased three HIMARS launchers for Ukraine from the United States last year, it paid $30 million in total.Each missile costs tens of thousands of dollars.But the bridge attacks were not the first time that Ukraine used small and relatively cheap first-person-view drones for maximum effect.In June, Ukrainian forces destroyed or damaged dozens of Russian aircraft using small drones that were smuggled to the vicinity of Russian military airfields in trucks.",

          "content": "Hundreds of foreign-born criminals who were let out onto Australian streets following a landmark High Court decision will be deported to Nauru, after Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke signed a $400 million deal with the Pacific island nation.Burke&#x27;s office released a statement to the Home Affairs website yesterday, explaining that the minister had met with Nauru President David Adeang and his cabinet to sign a memorandum of understanding that the nation would take members of the NZYQ group.The NZYQ cohort refers to the 350 foreign-born criminals who were released from detention after a high court ruling in November 2023, which found that the indefinite detention of non-citizens was unconstitutional, unless there was a plan to have them removed from the country.READ MORE: Police trying to get into mind of accused cop killer as manhunt continuesThe group, including convicted murderers and paedophiles, where released into the community after refusing to be deported to their home countries.Burke&#x27;s office published just two lines from the Minister about the agreement to deport the released detainees.\"Anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a valid visa should leave the country,\" he said.\"This is a fundamental element of a functioning visa system.\"The agreement states that Nauru will provide long-term residence to those who have no legal right to stay in Australia, the minister&#x27;s office said.It will continue to apply to all detainees who fall under the NZYQ cohort, the statement says.On Friday, Nauru&#x27;s parliament&#x27;s session revealed that Australia committed $408 million upfront to the island nation as part of the agreement, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.Australia will also pay $70 million to the nation annually to cover the ongoing cost&#x27;s of the resettlement. The agreement will be officially activated when the first detainees arrive in Nauru.It comes two days after Burke was accused of rushing through laws that strip foreign-born criminals of their right to fair process when the government tries to deport them to a third country.\"Procedural fairness is a fundamental principle in many areas of decision-making. However, these provisions can and are being used by non-citizens to delay and frustrate their removal,\" Burke told the federal parliament on Tuesday.The move has faced backlash from the Greens and human rights groups, who say the agreement is cruel.As of May 2024, at least 28 released detainees had reoffended on the back of the ruling that freed them into the community.",
