          "content": "Australia&#x27;s largest airline has been ordered to pay a landmark penalty of $90 million for what has been dubbed the largest case of illegal sackings in the country&#x27;s history.Qantas outsourced more than 1800 baggage handlers, cleaners and ground staff in 2020, in a move the Federal Court ruled was designed to curb union bargaining power in wage negotiations.The embattled airline&#x27;s appeal to the High Court was unsuccessful, paving the way for the penalty to be awarded on Monday.READ MORE: Four cars including $1 million Ferrari stolen from Melbourne homeThe Transport Workers Union sought the maximum penalty of $121 million, while Qantas urged Justice Michael Lee to impose a \"mid-range\" penalty between $40 million and $80 million.The Federal Court judge cited the \"sheer scale of the contraventions, being the largest of their type\" as a reason to impose a penalty that would deter other businesses from similar conduct.He ordered Qantas to pay $90 million in penalties, $50 million of which is to be paid directly to the union that brought the proceedings and highlighted the illegal conduct.\"To deprive someone of work illegally is to deprive someone of an aspect of their human dignity, and this is not assuaged simply by expressions of regret,\" Justice Lee said.READ MORE: Man charged after father, son, killed going for ice cream in Queensland He was scathing about the embattled airline&#x27;s conduct after the outsourcing, pointing to efforts to place a \"less than candid\" picture of the outsourcing decision before the court.He noted Qantas had apologised publicly but then had attempted to deny any compensation payments to the affected workers.Qantas will have to pay the hefty bill on top of a $120 million compensation payment it has made to the affected ground staff for their economic loss, pain and suffering following the outsourcing.However, Justice Lee said he didn&#x27;t have enough evidence to be convinced those payments would be made.The court was told the scandal-plagued airline began to finally accept responsibility for its actions in 2023, Justice Lee noted, which coincided with the departure of former CEO Alan Joyce.The courtroom was packed with union members and representatives, who hugged and exchanged smiles after Justice Lee handed down his decision.It comes after Qantas also sold tickets to cancelled flights for several years, triggering more legal turmoil and a $100 million fine after it was sued by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.In a statement, Qantas said it accepted the court&#x27;s decision.\"We sincerely apologise to each and every one of the 1820 ground handling employees and to their families who suffered as a result,\" chief executive Vanessa Hudson said.\"The decision to outsource five years ago, particularly during such an uncertain time, caused genuine hardship for many of our former team and their families.\"The impact was felt not only by those who lost their jobs, but by our entire workforce.\"Over the past 18 months, we&#x27;ve worked hard to change the way we operate as part of our efforts to rebuild trust with our people and our customers. This remains our highest priority as we work to earn back the trust we lost.\" DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

I did not hear any knocks on the door,\" he said.Today, defence barrister Matthew Jackson said police spent one minute and 20 seconds knocking on Crawford&#x27;s door.READ MORE: Capital set for soaking as another cold front sweeps inREAD MORE: Extraordinary move ahead of Zelenskyy, Trump meeting\"They did not make Crawford aware they were exercising police powers,\" Jackson said.Jackson told Mr Howden the body worn camera did not show police taking extra steps such as calling out to Crawford or shining torches in his windows.Page said it was not for police officers to reinterpret the conditions of a Supreme Court bail order and that they were not permitted to do anything other than knock on the door.\"Given the serious nature of the charges ... (Crawford) is under the obligation to do everything he can to comply with bail conditions,\" Page said.Following a two-hour hearing with three police witnesses, Howden granted the application for no case to answer and dismissed the breach of bail charge.\"I am satisfied (Crawford) was asleep when police knocked on his door and he did not hear them knocking,\" Howden said.\"In that circumstance, the police case must fail because they are unable to prove he was asked to answer the door.\"Crawford appeared in court dressed in a black suit and light blue tie, sitting at the bar table during the hearing with his hands clasped in his lap.He declined to comment when approached by reporters as he exited court today.The murder charge is due to be next heard on October 8 at Ipswich Magistrates Court for committal proceedings.Crawford was suspended from the Royal Australian Air Force in October 2024, before separating from the Australian Defence Force in April.Support is available from the National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service at 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732).",
