King Charles released a statement after his brother&#x27;s arrest, pledging \"full and wholehearted support and co-operation\" with authorities.LIVE UPDATES: Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor arrestedWhat has he been arrested for?Police arrived at Wood Farm, the Sandringham home of King Charles III&#x27;s brother, just after 8am on Thursday (7pm AEDT).Thames Valley Police said they had arrested a man in his 60s on suspicion of misconduct in public office. He was released almost 12 hours later at 6:50am AEDT, February 20. Thames Valley Police had earlier said it was \"assessing\" reports that the former Prince Andrew sent trade reports to convicted Epstein in 2010.Mountbatten-Windsor always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and said he regretted their friendship. He has not responded to requests for comment since the latest release of documents.What have police said?Thames Valley Police confirmed the charges in a statement. It did not name Mountbatten-Windsor but British media, including the BBC, reported the former prince was the man arrested.\"Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,\" Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said.\"It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence.\"We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.\"READ MORE: US President Donald Trump says ex-prince Andrew&#x27;s arrest &#x27;very, very sad to me&#x27; Following his release, Thames Valley Police gave little futher information.\"Thames Valley Police is able to provide an update in relation to an investigation into the offence of misconduct in public office,\" police said.\"On Thursday (19/2) we arrested a man in his sixties from Norfolk on suspicion of misconduct in public office.\"The arrested man has now been released under investigation.\"We can also confirm that our searches in Norfolk have now concluded.\"READ MORE: Former prince Andrew went from helicopter pilot to trade envoy to royal pariah What is misconduct in public office?In England, misconduct in public office is a common law offence that concerns \"serious wilful abuse or neglect of the power or responsibilities of the public office held,\" according to the Crown Prosecution Service, which is the body that prosecutes criminal cases investigated by police in England and Wales.\"There must be a direct link between the misconduct and an abuse of those powers or responsibilities,\" according to the prosecution service guidance.In this legal context, \"wilful\" abuse or neglect means \"deliberately doing something which is wrong knowing it to be wrong or with reckless indifference as to whether it is wrong or not\".The offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if proven. It can be tried only on indictment.What next? How long will the investigation take?Policing commentator Danny Shaw said it was hard to put a timeline on the investigation, which he said could be \"very quick\" but he guessed would likely take much longer.\"It could be the Thames Valley [Police] are there, they&#x27;ve got everything they need, they just need to do a few questions, and they can make a decision very quickly with the Crown Prosecution on charging,\" he told the BBC.\"So you can&#x27;t rule out it moving very quickly.\"But he thought it was \"much more likely\" in this kind of investigation that everyone would \"want to do things in an orderly manner and make sure that things are completely bottomed out\".\"So my guess, and it&#x27;s literally nothing more than that, is that it will be weeks before any really substantial decision is made between the Crown Prosecution Service and Thames Valley Police as to whether this is something that needs to be taken further and into the court,\" Shaw said.What has the royal family said?King Charles III released a statement in the hours after his brother&#x27;s arrest, saying \"the law must take its course\".\"I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,\" the King said.\"What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities.\"In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation.\"Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.\"As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter.

          "content": "P olice have charged four teenagers over a spate of alleged shootings and arson attacks targeting the family of former NRL player Matt Utai.The 44-year-old ex Bulldogs and Wests Tigers winger was shot outside his family home in Greenacre, in the city&#x27;s south-west, about 6am on Tuesday.He was treated by police and paramedics before being taken to hospital in a serious condition. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Matt Utai and police say he is not involved in any criminal activity.LIVE UPDATES: Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor arrestedPolice said the alleged gunman fired from an SUV before it drove away. A short time later the car, a black Toyota, was found burnt out in the nearby suburb of Wiley Park.The following night, at about 12.45am, shots were fired at a house in St Clair. A woman in her 50s was uninjured inside.A second burnt-out car discovered a short time later in Colyton was seized by police for forensic examination.The morning following the second shooting, at 6.05am, a fire broke out at a Guildford West house and a nearby car was set alight. Firefighters extinguished both blazes and no one was injured.NSW Police set up Strike Force Halesowen to investigate the incidents, all of which are believed to have been targeting the family of Utai.READ MORE: What happens next after Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor arrestedOfficers yesterday raided four properties in Riverwood, Guildford, Lilyfield, Villawood and Auburn and seized three vehicles, 1kg of cocaine, knuckle dusters, electronics and clothing.Two 19-year-old men, a man aged 18 and a 16-year-old boy were all arrested and charged with drug, firearms and other offences.The 18-year-old was granted bail and is due to front court next Tuesday.The two 19-year-olds were refused bail and are scheduled to appear in court today.The 16-year-old was refused bail and is set to appear in the childrens court today.Investigations continue. New Zealand-born Utai joined the Bulldogs in 2002 and was a pivotal member of the club&#x27;s 2004 premiership-winning side, scoring two tries in the defeat of the Sydney Roosters.He also represented New Zealand, including an appearance in the 2008 World Cup.Utai departed the Bulldogs in 2010 and one year later joined the Wests Tigers, playing for the Sydney club until the end of his career in 2013. Since his retirement, he has worked as a tradie.Police are investigating whether Utai&#x27;s son Iziah&#x27;s alleged links to the Alameddine crime network could have been the reason behind the alleged attacks.9News understands 24-year-old Iziah is currently overseas.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
