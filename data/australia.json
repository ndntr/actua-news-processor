Littleproud has yet to comment on Joyce&#x27;s announcement.

Just last week, the Nationals Tamworth branch chairman, Steven Coxhead, resigned after a decade in the role to defect to One Nation.\"I have resigned as I believe the party does not adequately represent NSW regional and rural voters any more,\" he said. One Nation saw a surge at this year&#x27;s federal election and experienced its highest level of support since 2017.In New England, the party captured 10 per cent of the vote, more than double the 4.7 per cent recorded in 2022.

READ MORE: Prince Andrew announces he&#x27;s given up his Duke of York title and honours A study by Bullying No Way also found that one in four students from year four to year nine reported being bullied every few weeks or more often.The $10 million investment from the government as part of this review will be split evenly between an awareness campaign and resources for parents, teachers and students.\"We&#x27;re going to allocate $5 million to provide some tools for teachers. While parents have told us they want action earlier, parents of teachers have told us that they need the tools and the training so that they can do the job,\" Jason Clare told Today.\"There are programs that are already being used by some schools. We&#x27;re going to put all of those online in a hub, so that they can go to one place to get the best tools and the best programs to roll out in their schools.\"READ MORE: Missing camper tells of miracle rescue after nine-day ordeal\"Parents have told us that they think it&#x27;s really important that we nip this in the bud, where there&#x27;s a complaint that bullying has happened, the school needs action within the first 48 hours.\"\"And that involves talking to the children, but it also involves talking to the mums and dads, the parents of the child that&#x27;s been bullied and the parents of the child that&#x27;s been doing the bullying.\"One of the main recommendations was the need for quick and clear action when a complaint or incident occurs.\"[Punishments] can involve suspension. It can involve expulsion in the most extreme circumstances.READ MORE: Aussie jobseeker rejected from Woolies job after AI interviews\"What happens here is that if you act early, you can stop the harm from repeating. You can stop the action from recurring.\"The review contained over 1700 submissions from parents, students, teachers and staff recommending that schools should respond to incidents within two school days.\"A lot of parents told us it was taking too long for some schools to act on bullying complaints,\" said Clare.The Federal Government&#x27;s under-16 social media ban is set to come into effect on December 10, which the review expects will also drastically help in reducing cyberbullying.
