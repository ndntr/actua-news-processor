It certainly wasn&#x27;t murder or manslaughter,\" he said.Crown prosecutor Samantha O&#x27;Rourke had argued Al Enizi deliberately struck Vandenberg, intending to do at least grievous bodily harm, and there was no lawful reason for doing so.Al Enizi left court without speaking to media, as did Vandenberg&#x27;s family and supporters.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
