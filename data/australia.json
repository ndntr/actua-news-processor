Her daughter Katherine said the family had been left \"shocked and saddened\" by her much-loved mother&#x27;s death.\"From the little we have been told, it seems that there was a failure of care and common sense,\" she said in a statement.\"We understand from the police that it was a very hot day, and mum felt ill on the hill climb.\"She was asked to head down, unescorted.\"Then the ship left, apparently without doing a passenger count.\"At some stage in that sequence, or shortly after, mum died, alone.\"She was a healthy, active 80-year-old who enjoyed gardening and was an active member of a bushwalking group.\"I hope that the coronial inquiry will find out what the company should have done that might have saved mum&#x27;s life.\" The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said in a statement it was investigating and would question the ship&#x27;s crew when the ship docks in Darwin, scheduled for Sunday.\"AMSA will make an assessment as to whether there was any non-compliance associated with the passenger not being counted onto the ship and, if necessary, will take action to address them,\" a spokesperson said. AMSA said it began searching with Queensland Police after the ship&#x27;s captain reported the woman missing to authorities at 9pm last Saturday.Coral Expeditions chief executive Mark Fifield offered his apology to the woman&#x27;s family and said the company was working with authorities in their investigations.\"Coral Expeditions can confirm the tragic death of a passenger on the Coral Adventurer during an excursion to Lizard Island in Queensland,\" he said in a statement.\"While investigations into the incident are continuing, we are deeply sorry that this has occurred and are offering our full support to the woman&#x27;s family.\"The Coral team have been in contact with the woman&#x27;s family, and we will continue to offer support to them through this difficult process.\"We are working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation.\"Queensland Police is investigating the death, but has ruled it non-suspicious.A report is being prepared for the coroner.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
