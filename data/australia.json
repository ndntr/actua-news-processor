          "content": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has written to his British counterpart backing any plan to remove former prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of royal succession.In the wake of the royal&#x27;s Thursday arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office, the UK government confirmed it was looking at ways to remove him from the line for the throne.Mountbatten-Windsor is eighth in the line of succession and could technically be named regent or temporarily take over the King&#x27;s duties even earlier, although Buckingham Palace has effectively ruled that out.READ MORE: Infamous photo of ex-prince Andrew hung in LouvreIn a letter released tonight, Albanese wrote to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressing his support for removing the former duke of York.\"In light of recent events concerning Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, I am writing to confirm that my Government would agree to any proposal to remove him from the line of royal succession,\" Albanese wrote.\"I agree with His Majesty that the law must now take its full course and there must be a full, fair and proper investigation.\"These are grave allegations and Australians take them seriously.\"The support of Albanese and the leaders of the other Commonwealth countries who retain the UK&#x27;s reigning monarch as their head of state is essential to any plan to remove him.Mountbatten-Windsor&#x27;s arrest followed years of allegations over his links with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who died by suicide in a New York jail in 2019, but the accusation at the heart was that the royal shared confidential trade information with the disgraced financier when he was a trade envoy for the UK. READ MORE: Timeline of events that led to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor&#x27;s arrestHe was released on Thursday night (early Friday AEDT) after spending about 11 hours in custody. He remained under investigation, meaning he was neither charged nor exonerated.Emails released last month by the US Department of Justice appeared to show him sharing reports of official visits to Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore, and sending Epstein a confidential brief on investment opportunities in Afghanistan.He has consistently denied any wrongdoing in his association with Epstein but has not commented on the most recent allegations that have emerged with the release of the Epstein files.READ MORE: The British royal family faces its worst crisis in generations In the wake of the arrest, UK Defence Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC that wiping his chances of being a successor to the throne was the \"right thing to do\" regardless of the outcome.He told BBC radio at the weekend that the UK government had been working alongside Buckingham Palace to stop Mountbatten-Windsor from \"potentially being a heartbeat away from the throne\".UK media quoted unnamed royal sources saying Buckingham Palace would not oppose the move.While King Charles was able to strip his brother of all his royal and military titles and banish him from Royal Lodge, removing him from the line of succession would require legislation in the UK and the other Commonwealth \"realms\", including Australia.READ MORE: Inside the secret operation to arrest former prince AndrewIn November, University College London said if the worst were to happen to King Charles and then Prince William, Prince Harry would be next in line to be named as regent to Prince George, but only if he returned to the UK.Were he to refuse, Mountbatten-Windsor would be next in line, although he was \"unlikely to be considered suitable following his fall from grace\".\"A person can only be removed as a counsellor of state by legislation,\" it said in an FAQ.\"Because seven people can now be called upon to act as counsellors of state, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor is very unlikely to be called upon again.\"- Reported with Associated Press NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

          "content": "Nick Reiner, the 32-year-old son of acclaimed director Rob Reiner, has pleaded not guilty in the US to two counts of first-degree murder in the fatal stabbing of his parents in December.Reiner&#x27;s attorney, Deputy Public Defender Kimberly Greene, entered the plea on his behalf as he stood behind glass in an enclosed custody area of the packed Los Angeles courtroom.The third of Rob Reiner&#x27;s four children, Nick Reiner has been held without bail since his arrest hours after the actor-director and Michele Singer Reiner, his wife of 36 years, were found dead on December 14 at their home in the upscale Brentwood section of Los Angeles.READ MORE: Former UK ambassador to US arrested in Epstein files probe Reiner appeared in court with his head shaved and wearing brown jail clothes. He talked to his lawyer briefly before the judge began the hearing and spoke only to answer yes to a question from the judge. He was not wearing the suicide prevention smock he wore in his first court appearance in December.The judge told Reiner to return to court April 29 for the scheduling of a preliminary hearing where prosecutors will present evidence and a judge will decide if it&#x27;s enough for Reiner to go to trial.District Attorney Nathan Hochman said outside court that his office still hasn&#x27;t decided whether it will seek the death penalty for Reiner.READ MORE: Albanese backs push to boot former prince Andrew from royal succession Reiner&#x27;s not guilty plea is common for criminal defendants at this stage of the case, whatever their longer-term plan might be.Reiner&#x27;s previous attorney, the high-profile private lawyer Alan Jackson, had to quit the case at the hearing in January because of what he called circumstances beyond his and his client&#x27;s control.He said legal ethics would not allow him to say why, but in parting he adamantly declared that \"pursuant to the laws of California, Nick Reiner is not guilty of murder.\"READ MORE: Dozens of troops left dead in bust that killed cartel leader Jackson did not elaborate but said the conclusion came after weeks of intensive investigation before his team had to hand the case off. He said he wanted to push back against false reporting on the case.It&#x27;s not clear who hired Jackson to represent Reiner or who was paying the bill. Generally, defendants use public defenders when they can&#x27;t afford a private attorney.Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian said Monday that his office is still awaiting a full autopsy report in the case, but all other evidence has been turned over to the defence.Rob Reiner, 78, and Michele Singer Reiner, 70, died from \"multiple sharp force injuries,\" the LA County Medical Examiner said in initial findings.Authorities said they were killed hours before the bodies were discovered. A court order has prevented the release of more details and authorities have said nothing about possible motives.Rob Reiner was a prolific director whose work included some of the most memorable and endlessly watchable movies of the 1980s and &#x27;90s.His credits included This is Spinal Tap, Stand By Me, A Few Good Men, and When Harry Met Sally… , during which production he met photographer Michele Singer and married her soon after.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

          "content": "British police have arrested Peter Mandelson, a former UK ambassador to the US, in a misconduct probe stemming from his ties with Jeffrey Epstein.London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police force on Monday (early Tuesday AEDT) said \"officers have arrested a 72-year-old man on suspicion of misconduct in public office\" at an address in north London.It did not name Mandelson, in keeping with British police practice but the suspect in the case has previously been identified as Mandelson.READ MORE: Albanese backs push to deliver final Andrew humiliationPolice are investigating Mandelson over documents suggesting he passed sensitive government information to Epstein a decade and a half ago. He does not face any allegations of sexual misconduct.His arrest comes four days after Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former prince Andrew, was arrested on suspicion of a similar offence related to his friendship with Epstein.Andrew was released after 11 hours in custody while the police investigation continues.Mandelson was fired from his diplomatic post in September after emails were published showing that he maintained a friendship with Epstein after the financier&#x27;s 2008 conviction for sex offences involving a minor.When more details emerged in documents released by the US Justice Department last month, police opened a criminal probe.The Epstein files suggest that Mandelson passed on sensitive — and potentially market-moving — government information to Epstein in 2009, when Mandelson was a member of the then government.Officers subsequently searched Mandelson&#x27;s two houses in London and western England.The decision to appoint Mandelson nearly cost Starmer his job as questions swirled around his judgment in someone who has flirted with controversy during a decades-long political career.Though he has acknowledged he made a mistake and apologised to victims of Epstein, Starmer&#x27;s position remains precarious. His future may rest on the release of files connected to Mandelson&#x27;s appointment.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
