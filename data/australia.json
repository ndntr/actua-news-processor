It&#x27;s made $20 millionThe report looked at three key warming scenarios in Australia: 1.5 degrees, 2 degrees and three degrees of warming.It found the planet is heading towards 2.9 degrees of warming by 2030.Warming of this level would result in heatwave deaths skyrocketing by 444 per cent in Sydney and 423 per cent in Darwin.READ MORE: Teacher who beat cancer killed in tragic jet ski accidentThe rising temperatures will then increase the risk of communicable diseases from mosquitos and ticks.\"Public health risks will become more pronounced, with a significant potential for loss of life and strain on health systems,\" the report noted.Among the natural disasters and environmental crises we could face as temperatures rise are more frequent category 4 and 5 cyclones, large hail on the east coast and an increased risk of bushfires in forested areas.Dangerous fire weather days are projected to become more frequent in southern and eastern areas too.The assessment also noted 63 \"nationally significant\" climate risks.These include threats to Australia&#x27;s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, risks to infrastructure, mental health impacts and loss of animal species.Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen said the report made it clear that vulnerable Australians in rural communities will bear the brunt of climate change.\"Whether it be cropping, cattle sheep, fisheries… the report makes clear that Australia&#x27;s regional areas will be big losers from climate change,\" Bowen said.\"We are living [through] climate change now, it&#x27;s no longer a forecast, projection, or prediction.\"It is a lived reality. It is too late to avoid any impact now. But it&#x27;s not too late to avoid the worst of the impacts.\"The financial impact of climate change in Australia is predicted to be astronomical.Losses in property value could soar to $611 billion by 2050 and may reach $770 billion by 2090.Disaster costs for each state and territory for flood, bushfire, storm surge and tropical cyclones for a moderate emissions scenario (+1.5 degrees ) could reach an annual cost of $40.3 billion by 2050 too.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
