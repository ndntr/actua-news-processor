          "content": "A Liberal Party leadership spill has been confirmed ahead of an urgent partyroom meeting.Federal Liberal MPs Phil Thompson and Jess Collins formally requested a leadership spill today by delivering a letter to Opposition Leader Sussan Ley, where it is expected former opposition defence spokesperson Angus Taylor will make his move.Liberal Party Whip Aaron Violi has also confirmed he received a request to hold the partyroom meeting to call a spill.READ MORE: Actor James Van Der Beek dies aged 48Nine&#x27;s political editor Charles Croucher said Taylor has the party support to seriously challenge Ley for the top job.\"What I&#x27;m being told here is that he has the numbers, although it&#x27;s close,\" Croucher said.Taylor said in a campaign message shared to X that the Liberal Party has \"lost it&#x27;s way\".\"I am running to be the leader of the Liberal Party, because I believe Australia is worth fighting for,\" Taylor said.\"I believe we need strong and decisive leadership that gives Australians clarity, courage, and confidence in providing a vision for the future.\"https://x.com/AngusTaylorMP/status/2021712288949092425?s=20Liberal moderate Jane Hume is widely expected to run for the deputy leadership if Taylor is successful in his challenge. It is believed Ley will call a partyroom meeting for today or tomorrow. While Taylor is vying for Liberal leadership, it is Ley&#x27;s decision when the meeting will take place.She is yet to formally comment on the challenge. Meanwhile, WA frontbencher Matt O&#x27;Sullivan has tendered his resignation amid the partyroom chaos. \"This decision has not been taken lightly,\" he said.\"However, I have reached the view that the Coalition currently lacks the policy clarity, leadership and strategic direction required to rebuild trust with voters and present a compelling alternative government.\"O&#x27;Sullivan joins Claire Chandler and Phil Thompson among a growing number of Liberal resignations.The countdown to the leadership spill Taylor&#x27;s long-foreshadowed resignation from the Liberal Party frontbench yesterday kicked off the countdown to a challenge to Ley&#x27;s leadership.While the former opposition defence spokesperson didn&#x27;t explicitly declare his plans last night, his decision to quit and outright withdrawal of support for Ley&#x27;s leadership made his intentions clear.\"But we can&#x27;t mince words. The Liberal Party is at the worst position it has been since 1944, when the party was formed. That is a confronting reality and we cannot ignore it,\" Taylor said.READ MORE: Taylor quits frontbench for leadership showdown\"I don&#x27;t believe Sussan Ley is in a position to be able to lead the party, as it needs to be led from here.\"This morning, Liberal frontbencher Claire Chandler resigned from Ley&#x27;s frontbench, with a number of Taylor&#x27;s supporters set to follow.What happens now?The next step is to call a party room meeting, where a motion to spill the leadership can be called.If it&#x27;s seconded and supported by a majority, nominations for leader will be opened and another vote will be called to decide who takes over, or if Ley stays.The party tightened rules in 2018 in response to a revolving door of leaders to require a two-thirds majority to expel a sitting elected prime minister. But that doesn&#x27;t apply in this case, meaning a simple majority is enough.Who&#x27;s said what?Declarations of support for either Liberal from their colleagues were thin on the ground last night but reporting suggested more resignations could be coming this week.Right-wing Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price was unsurprisingly quick to come out in support of Taylor, telling Sky News the party would be \"wiped out\" without a change.\"I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any secret that I&#x27;ll be backing Angus Taylor and I will be backing a move for a change of leadership,\" she said.Moderate Liberal MP Tim Wilson said he would \"support the leader\" but declined to pledge his explicit backing to Ley in a future leadership vote.\"Well, as I&#x27;ve said, if you want loyalty, you have to show loyalty, and I believe in loyalty very much as a foundation for trust,\" he told ABC&#x27;s 7.30.\"And off the back of that, I will then be going on, of course, as processes go on, to make sure that I&#x27;m making the decision in the best interests of the Liberal Party.\"But I&#x27;ve said that, you know, I support the leader.\"South Australian MP Tony Pasin expressed his support for Taylor.\"Look the reality is something had to change,\" he said.\"And I just went and saw Angus then and said, I&#x27;m proud of him. It takes real courage. \"We can&#x27;t keep doing what we&#x27;ve always done if we want different results, right?\"Queensland LNP MP Garth Hamilton said he was glad the issue had been \"brought to a head\".\"We clearly need to address these issues. They&#x27;ve been playing out for far too long publicly,\" he said.\"I think it&#x27;s an important part of democratic process.\"Who has the numbers?Nine national affairs editor Andrew Probyn said many Liberals were angry Ley hadn&#x27;t had a fair crack at the leadership while others were prepared to back Taylor but suspected he didn&#x27;t have what it took to take on Labor.\"What was striking about Angus Taylor tonight was that he didn&#x27;t announce any new policy direction at this stage, the main policy is simply that he wants to be leader now,\" he said.\"That may change tomorrow. Perhaps he&#x27;ll give his colleagues a better pitch, but for liberals voting in a leadership ballot, the biggest question is whether they stick with Sussan Ley.\"I&#x27;m told that the numbers remain tight, neither side entirely confident, but even Lee&#x27;s supporters want this damaging squabble sorted out one way or the other.\"What do the polls say?If a Sky News Pulse poll by YouGov is to be believed, voters don&#x27;t really want Taylor or Ley in charge of the Liberal Party.Andrew Hastie, who pulled out of a brewing three-way showdown to clear the air for Taylor late last month, led with 15 per cent, followed by Ley with 10 per cent and Taylor with 8 per cent.But the damning result for the party didn&#x27;t even have a name to it, with 60 per cent of voters saying they didn&#x27;t know who should lead it.Among Liberal voters, Hastie&#x27;s lead was starker (25 per cent compared to 12 and 11 per cent for Ley and Taylor).The latest Newspoll released on Monday saw the Coalition&#x27;s primary vote slide to 18 per cent, now behind Labor at 33 per cent and One Nation on 27 per cent.The Liberal primary vote was just 15 per cent.How did we get here?A leadership spill has been looming after a tumultuous period for the Liberals.The Coalition split last month when three Nationals senators voted against the government&#x27;s hate groups bill and were sacked from the frontbench.Although the parties have since come back together, there have been growing concerns that One Nation has overtaken the Liberals in opinion polls and Ley&#x27;s personal preferred prime minister polls have tanked.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

          "content": "Cutting-edge DNA analysis used in the US to catch the notorious \"Golden State Killer\" has led police to arrest a man accused of multiple alleged historic sexual assaults in NSW.The first alleged assault took place on the morning of Saturday, March 16, 1991, when an unknown man approached an 11-year-old girl on Rayben Street in Glendenning, in Sydney&#x27;s west.He allegedly ushered the girl into his car for a lift, drove her around, stopped the car and sexually assaulted her, before dropping her at Mount Druitt Railway Station.READ MORE: Taylor quits frontbench to set up Liberal leadership battle with LeyAt about 1am on Saturday, February 17, 1996, a 16-year-old girl accepted a lift from an unknown man in Kanahooka in southern Wollongong.After driving for some time, he allegedly stopped the vehicle and sexually assaulted her before dropping her in Warrawong.In the early hours of Sunday December, 22, 2002, a 26-year-old woman accepted a lift from an unknown man near the Commercial Hotel in Dubbo.READ MORE: Alleged Big Build union corruption may have cost Victorians up to $30 billionHe drove her to Devil&#x27;s Hole Reserve, where he stopped the vehicle and allegedly sexually assaulted her, before dropping her a short distance away on Cobbora Road.All three incidents were reported to police, and DNA samples were obtained in each case, however, the matters remained unsolved.In 2022, State Crime Command&#x27;s Sex Crimes Squad began a review of several historic sexual assault cases to assess their suitability for emerging forensic technologies.READ MORE: At least 10 dead, dozens injured in Canada school shooting New DNA analysis confirmed the three incidents listed above were linked by the same male DNA profile.A renewed investigation was able to make use of forensic investigative genetic genealogy (FIGG).FIGG is an emerging investigative tool that combines advanced DNA analysis with traditional genealogy to help identify suspects through commercial DNA databases.The technique first gained widespread public recognition after it was used to identify and catch the \"Golden State Killer\", former US police officer Joseph James DeAngelo, in California.Unlike standard forensic DNA profiling, which examines 21 markers, FIGG analyses hundreds of thousands of genetic markers, enabling investigators to identify extended familial relationships, sometimes as distant as third or fourth cousins.These genetic markers are compared against two public genealogy databases – GEDmatch PRO and FamilyTreeDNA – which permit law-enforcement access to consenting profiles for use in solving serious and violent crimes.In this case, the unknown male DNA profile was uploaded to the databases, allowing detectives to identify what they claim is a close relative of the suspect.At about 12.45pm yesterday, strike force detectives executed a search warrant in South Kempsey on the NSW Mid North Coast, where they arrested a 77-year-old man.He was charged with a string of offences, including five counts of sexual intercourse without consent.He was refused bail and will appear in court today.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

He wed his wife Kimberley Brook in 2010, and they had six children together.The family relocated from LA to a ranch near Austin, Texas, in 2020. It was while living there that he received a diagnosis of colorectal cancer in 2023, but he only made the news public a year later to raise attention to the disease.He became an advocate for earlier detection of colorectal cancer but kept his own battle private, choosing not to share details of his treatment.READ MORE: Urgent deadline looms for thousands like Justin owed share in $475mHe seemed to be doing well up until the middle of 2025, even appearing on red carpets.But it was his video appearance at a Dawson&#x27;s Creek reunion and cancer fundraiser he was forced to pull out of in September 2024 that worried fans due to his gaunt appearance.Van Der Beek is survived by his wife and their six children. Early life and career breakthroughVan Der Beek was born on March 8, 1977, in the US state of Connecticut. His mother was a dancer and gymnastics teacher while his father was a mobile phone company executive and former minor league baseball player.After a high school performance in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, he asked his mother to take him into New York City to get an agent when he was 15.He made his professional debut in an off-Broadway production at 16 then appeared in a 1993 episode of the TV show Clarissa Explains it All.READ MORE: Piece of paper could have saved OJ Simpson tens of millions of dollarsIn 1995, he made his feature film debut in Angus then appeared in three episodes of soap opera As The World Turns, before winning his best known role in the hit TV show Dawson&#x27;s Creek.The teen drama was an instant hit when it first aired in 1998, and made huge stars out of its cast, although Van Der Beek admitted in 2013 he struggled at first with the level of stardom it brought.\"I went from signing my first autograph in 1998 to, literally two weeks later, being rushed by an angry, screaming mob of teenage girls [and] girls getting crushed against barricades and [me] being shoved in the back of a cop car to escape the melee,\" he told Vulture in 2013.READ MORE: &#x27;Probably know every one of the victims&#x27;: School shooting rocks tiny townThe show went on to run for six seasons, before ending in 2003.It was credited with starting a trend of teenage-centered shows, which continued well into the 2000s and was once included in the Entertainment Weekly list of top 100 of classic TV shows.While the character put him on the map, Van der Beek once admitted during an interview with Paper Magazine that Dawson&#x27;s famously mopey character – his crying face later became a well-known meme – would probably make him want to avoid him in real life.\"Dawson was sweet, but would probably get on my nerves and end up as one of those people I found myself making excuses to not hang out with,\" he said.Life after Dawson&#x27;s CreekVan Der Beek capitalised on his Dawson&#x27;s Creek fame while the show was still on the air, starring in several films during its production breaks, including the 1999 film Varsity Blues, which clinched him the MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Male Performance.Next he starred in 2001&#x27;s Texas Rangers, and the 2002 comedy, The Laws of Attraction.But after the show that made him a household name ended, he initially found it hard to top that success, although he did work consistently in the early 2000s, with guest roles in TV shows Criminal Minds, Ugly Betty, One Tree Hill and Medium.READ MORE: Taylor quits frontbench to set up Liberal leadership battle with LeyIn 2010, he appeared in 10 episodes of the medical drama Mercy, then won a role in the sitcom Don&#x27;t Trust the B---- In Apartment 23, where he played an over-the-top version of himself.Next came the sitcom, Friends With Better Lives, which ran for one season.He won a starring role in TV drama CSI: Cyber, alongside Ted Danson and Patricia Arquette, as FBI Agent Elijah Mundo, which ended its two-season run in 2016.He continued to work regularly, making a guest appearance as Bo Johnson in Modern Family and later in five episodes of Pose.He also voiced the character of Boris in the animated TV series Vampirina, which ran from 2017 to 2021.Marriage and children Shortly after finding fame on Dawson&#x27;s Creek, Van Der Beek started dating Heather McComb, who was best known for her roles in the crime drama Profiler and another teen family drama, Party of Five.They reportedly first met in 1998 through McComb&#x27;s sister, Jennifer, who made a guest appearance on Dawson&#x27;s Creek.The couple became engaged in 2003 and wed in Malibu a few months later.READ MORE: New data reveals e-bike &#x27;epidemic&#x27; as injuries surgeThey were married for six years before Van Der Beek filed for divorce in June 2009, citing irreconcilable differences.Shortly after their separation, Van Der Beek found himself in Israel in 2009, where he met former actress and producer turned podcaster Kimberly Brook.In a 2020 Instagram post, Van Der Beek reflected on their first meeting.\"I&#x27;d been famous, been wealthy, been married, been divorced, been less-than-wealthy, been single... and I was in Israel, on a trip with an organised group, when it hit me: I was done being single,\" he wrote.READ MORE: Woman &#x27;deliberately&#x27; run over during burnout dispute\"I wanted a real relationship.

Who the hell was stepping all over my moment? I turned around... it was @vanderkimberly.\"Three days later, I asked her what she was looking for in a relationship. Her answer: &#x27;I&#x27;m not looking for a relationship.&#x27;\"Six months later we were living together. Two weeks after that we were pregnant, and almost exactly one year to the date after she&#x27;d first interrupted me... we were married.\"READ MORE: Five charged after timber planks found to be &#x27;soaped&#x27; with 100kg of cocaineThe couple returned to Israel for their wedding on August 1, 2010.Their first child, daughter Olivia, arrived just over a month later.

We wanted to give them space and we wanted them to live in nature.\"The family moved to a 14.6 hectare ranch near Austin that same year.READ MORE: Shark spotted swimming inside ocean pool at popular Sydney beachCancer diagnosisIn November 2024, Van Der Beek, revealed he was diagnosed with stage three colorectal cancer the previous August, when he was 46, which he had been dealing with and treating privately with the support of his family.\"What do you do when you are staring down a stage three diagnosis?\" he said in an emotional interview with People.\"This is either going to take me out of the body or teach me how to truly live in it.\"At the time, he revealed he had decided to undergo a colonoscopy after experiencing some symptoms, and was still coming out of the anaesthetic when the gastroenterologist told him \"it is cancer\".READ MORE: Two arrested in Italy over armed robbery on security truck\"And I think I went into shock a little bit.\"He said that at the time he knew very little about cancer, his type of cancer or what stage it was.He resisted the urge to break down but said that when he woke up the following morning he knew his life had been \"uprooted\".READ MORE: Trump told police in mid-2000s &#x27;everyone has known&#x27; about Epstein&#x27;s misconduct\"And thus began the full time job of having cancer,\" he said.He later learned that while the cancer was localised, it was stage three, adding \"it&#x27;s not what you want to hear\".However, he said \"I really didn&#x27;t feel like this was going to end me\".While he stayed positive 90 per cent of the time, he admitted that \"10 per cent of the time I was a sobbing, terrified mess\".He admitted at the time his children were &#x27;scared&#x27; and praised his &#x27;extraordinary&#x27; wife for being by his side during treatment, which at times left him &#x27;laid low&#x27; and &#x27;scraping the bottom of despair&#x27;.\"One of the trickiest things about cancer for me are the unknowns,\" he said, adding he was \"feeling great and cautiously optimistic\".He returned to work in 2024, appearing in an episode of the TV series Walker, the film Sidelined: The QB and Me and in two episodes of the TV series Overcompensating.He appeared on the red carpet at the latter&#x27;s premiere in May 2025 sporting a moustache and looking well.Two months earlier, he marked his 48th birthday by sharing a video to Instagram explaining how his diagnosis had affected every aspect of his life.He also suggested his battle with cancer had taken a bad turn.\"This year, I had to look my own mortality in the eye. I had to come nose to nose with death. And all of those definitions that I cared so deeply about were stripped from me,\" he said.In July 2025, he gave an update during an interview on the US Today show, which seemed to suggest his cancer was incurable. \"It&#x27;s a process,\" he said. \"I&#x27;ll probably be on a process for the rest of my life.\"He also started working to raise awareness of colorectal cancer and the use of noninvasive blood tests available in the US that offer early detection. \"I really want to impress upon people that you don&#x27;t need symptoms to get screened,\" he told Healthline. \"If you are 45 or older or have a family history, talk to your doctor about your screening options.\"But it was his appearance via video link at a live script reading that reunited the cast of Dawson&#x27;s Creek while raising funds for the charity F Cancer that first raised fears about his health.He had been scheduled to attend the September 22 event but pulled out at the last moment, with his wife and children attending in his place.Van Der Beek said he was battling two stomach viruses but his thin and frail appearance alarmed fans.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
